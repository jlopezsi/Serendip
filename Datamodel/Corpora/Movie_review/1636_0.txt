this is excellent example of film noir almost everything you'd want in this genre right from the opening shot this had noir written all over it by cinematographer bert glennon and from opening holdup-murder scene at the gas station you knew you were in for a rough ride br br speaking of rough i can't think of too many actors who were better and more suited for noir than sterling hayden who delivers yet another uncompromising hard-headed tough guy character this time he's a cop det lt sims and one with no use for any con even if the guy in this case gene nelson's steve lacey has cleaned up his act br br it wasn't just the photography and haden the entire cast was fascinating and it's simply a fast-moving entertaining film andre de toth's direction also was terrific he directed only one other noir pitfall another great film that we are still waiting to see on dvd at least this film finally made it to disc br br i had forgotten what classic beauty phyllis kirk possessed wow what a face she starred as nora charles on the popular thin man television series in the 50s in here she plays lacey's wife ellen rather that going through the whole cast i'll just say it was a hoot to see timothy carey again even if his role was limited this guy played the most whacked-out minor characters i've ever seen in movies see the killing for a good example of what i mean jay novello as the veterinarian ex-con also was really interesting br br i'll tell you what else was nice the realistic scenes with actual locations around los angeles in the early 50s this movie had a number of hand-held camera shots even the holdup in the bank was done in a real bank there are few if any hokey studio shots in this movie it's the real deal and very much recommended combined with decoy on the same disc it makes for a nice double feature for a night of noir
