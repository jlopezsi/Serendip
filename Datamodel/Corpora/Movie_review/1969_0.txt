i too saw this on my l.a abc station as a cold night's death when i was a teenager i was really caught up in it the tension the atmosphere the mystery and the ending was great at least at that time all of this was attributable to several factors including the writing directing acting sets and sound effects i wonder how i'd react if i saw if for the first time now br br by chance i worked with the director jerrold freedman many years later at one point during that harried shoot i managed to tell him how much of an impression this movie had made on me obviously so since his name stuck in my head over the decades between br br here's another person strongly urging the release of this obscure gem on dvd perhaps now while it's still winter
