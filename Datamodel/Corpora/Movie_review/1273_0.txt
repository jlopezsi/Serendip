i believe that this movie was well acted as well as well thought out the question really is how do i tell young people about this terrible tragedy without being to graphic and still holding their attention i think that the movie answered that question admirably kirsten dunst is a great actress that showed her ability to tell a serious story with a sense of lightheartedness let's not forgot brittany murphy she is a highly underrated actress who just barely broke the surface of what she can do in this movie overall if your looking to tell/show a group of preteen/teens the story of the holocaust without the brutality then this is the only movie to show them
