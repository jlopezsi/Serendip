i rented this because it was written by ross thomas and i'm a huge fan of his novels i wanted to see how his ideas were put on the screen the story line and plot twists are very thomas but the characters seemed a little one-dimensional he is great at building characters in his novels but there just isn't enough time to do that in a movie i needed to see vulnerability in each character when all that was given was cold calculation which even the hardest cia agent is not br br the sex scenes seemed forced and i bet that they weren't in the original script thomas doesn't need to use sex to relate characters to each other but it's a quick gimmie for the film br br i recommend this movie to any ross thomas fan especially given that it was probably the last thing he wrote before he died otherwise watch it if you're into mystery but know that it's not very thrilling and can move slowly at times
