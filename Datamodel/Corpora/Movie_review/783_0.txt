the movie is really good due to ajith's excellent performance in the role of a man with feminine character br br since most part of the movie is shot when ajith was during the period of reducing his weight his looks are not same throughout the movie this is really intriguing in the flow of the narration br br k.s.ravikumar is in his usual stuff taking the plot of prostitution for the romance of the lead pair br br a.r.rahman's songs are hummable and good to watch.overall ajith's performance raises this movie and it lived to its expectation and the long wait was worth
