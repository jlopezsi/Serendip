this was one tame yawn of a nunsploitation br br there were like a coupla boob shots one feeble forced-looking lesbian kissing scene and apparently one rape scene i just thought they were all held-back or censored br br here's the breakdown acting okay very subtle characters no real development sympathy towards any of the characters devil is lame storyline just plain ol flatline nothing really happens br br the nun apparently being possessed by the devil is just uninspiring and cheesy don't buy the plot line that she's a bride of satan it's a crock br br uneventful waste of film the appeal of the title is definitely better than the actual film
