roberta 1935 is my favorite of the astaire/rogers musicals from the 1930's the plot may be criticized as silly but then so can the plot of most musicals and i watch a musical for light entertainment not for serious social commentary although the astaire/rogers dances are few they are choice no flashy ensemble extravaganzas that last too long to be enjoyed no unbelievably contrived dances or costumes and irene dunne's vocals are delightful to my ear the soundtrack has not survived the years as clearly as i would like but the movie as a whole is one that i return to over and over again to watch all the way through and i can't say that of any other astaire/rogers film perhaps that is because the entire cast does a job i find enjoyable
