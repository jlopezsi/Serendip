i suppose the viewers who label clockwatchers boring simply don't understand that dramas are meant to be slower than your garden-variety indiana jones or die hard these action flicks are ten-times as dull as the corporate setting for this astonishing study on class friendship and inner-awareness or maybe it is the female perspective or chick-flick factor that turn certain people off or maybe temporary status in modern american business isn't relevant to everyone or the subtle less gimmicky observations of reality br br clockwatchers is all of these things at once toni collette plays the ultra-shy newcomer to global credit the ultimate transnational corporation who slowly comes to realize that the doomed bond she makes with three other temps is an extremely sacred event in her life iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter iris comes full circle at the end of the film confronts one of her many bosses whom plot against her and atones for not standing with parker posey who is the life of the party as margaret br br the creators of this film are so incredibly accurate in revealing what worklife is actually like the boredom sharing someone else's space not knowing someone's name or them not knowing yours that i felt almost honored to know i wasn't alone movies that are this honest about despair are never depressing this is combined by the subtle observations of iris which i suppose aren't as exciting as blowing someone's head off or toilet humor but intriguing nonetheless it is finally layered with political analysis as the female temps organize a strike br br suffice it to say clockwatchers covers a lot of ground but the layers are folded well together in a way that makes you care about what happens to these characters and their station in life a must-see sleeper for those who prefer for example merchant ivory over van damme seagal 9 out of 10
