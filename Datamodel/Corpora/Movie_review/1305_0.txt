tekkon kinkreet is a sporadically engaging though frequently confusing anime gangster film from director michael arias the story based on the comic book by taiyo matsumoto focuses on two homeless orphans one named black and the other white who live on the streets of treasure town a seething cauldron of criminality vice and corruption black fancies himself a superhero crime-fighter while white who is given to extrasensory knowledge and visions dreams of one day moving away from the city and getting a home of their own on the beach thanks to black's insistence on taking on the bad guys both youngsters get caught up in a turf war between the yakuza and some robot-like killers who are duking it out for ownership of the city br br fans of anime will find much to enjoy in this film which is marked by beautifully detailed urban landscapes exciting action and chase sequences occasional lyrical flights into fantasy and a sometimes touching tale about commitment and friendship centered on the two young boys on the other hand the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn with imagery taken straight out of contact in the final half hour still the visuals alone make it worth a gander
