reap the wild wind is cecil b demille's contribution to such sea-faring adventure classics as the sea hawk or 20,000 leagues under the sea john wayne plays a ship captain ray milland plays a lawyer and paulette godard a feisty southern belle who comes between them there's plenty of fights a trial and an entertaining squid there's susan hayward robert preston louise beavers and raymond massey there's a wonderful music score and beautiful technicolor there's a playful monkey and a talking dog coutesy of milland's ventriloquism and it begins with demille's narration to set the tone for an action-packed if occasionally talky picture this is good old-fashioned filmaking at its finest for fans of all of the above plus hedda hopper in her last role not playing herself i highly recommend you definitely seek this one out
