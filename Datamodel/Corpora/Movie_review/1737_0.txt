if you see birth go in realizing it is an art-house film not a mainstream thriller if it didn't have nicole kidman in it this film would be playing in less than 10 theaters in the country but because of kidman it is playing in your local cineplex but this is not a film for the cineplex crowd if you are looking for something like the others the sixth sense or ghost do not see this film br br birth is a film where atmosphere means more that dialog this is not a fun film the people in the film are very deadpan and do not smile especially the child much has been made of the bath scene but that is actually one of the least radical parts of this film the thing that will upset most people are the long close-ups without any dialog also the conclusion does not tie up as many loose ends as a mainstream film this film wants the viewer to think about it afterwards br br nicole kidman and lauren bacall are great but for me anne heche almost stole the film with her small part also the music is atmospheric and a real treat if you like symphonic music br br this is a beautiful film to look at and listen to the story will keep you guessing which direction it is going to go whether you are happy with the outcome or not will probably depend on your expectations go into this film with an open mind 9/10
