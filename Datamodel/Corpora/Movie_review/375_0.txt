this movie was absolutely the best werewolf movie ever made it was so good that if i didn't have a short attention span i would watch it back-to-back every day br br first of all the acting once again was superb emily perkins does a wonderful job as brigitte and the new character ghost was perfect although her lines seemed a little too rehearsed br br i really like the dark humor in it once again i like movies that can be dramatic somewhat scary and funny all at once all movies should be i don't know how people can say that they don't like this movie i do br br the ending where ghost traps the transforming brigitte in her cellar and then welcomes her grandma home is perfectly dark i kinda think it's mean that she wants to hurt her grandma but it goes with the plot i especially like the very end when she's reading the comic and she says something like and off she went on her reign of terror to vanquish her mortal enemies of which there were many br br i don't know why i like it so much it's just perfect
