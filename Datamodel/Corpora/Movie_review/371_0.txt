respectable even impressive follow-up to the sharp-witted canadian horror indie this one doesn't have the sustained thematic focus of the first but all in all it's as twisted watchable and occasionally amusing as fans of the series would hope if emily perkins's performance doesn't blow us away as it did in ginger snaps that's only because it's not as much of a surprise this time around and tatiana maslany's ghost makes a goofy but plausible addition to the films world as i said it's not the out-and-out allegory that the first film was but there are rich satiric moments flashes of wit brigitte's discovery of her hairy palms comes to mind and nice nods to werewolf-movie convention with the finale taking place in a remote cabin in the snowy woods there are a few problems too a weak tv-ish performance by eric johnson completely unnecessary cameos by ginger herself and worst of all an unfair and somewhat sad shift of focus at the end but these things don't really diminish ginger snaps 2's accomplishments and it remains an entertaining and original new horror film a very rare thing these days 7.5 out of 10
