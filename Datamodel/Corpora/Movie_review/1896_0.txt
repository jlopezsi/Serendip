it's become a classic the film has a recurring catchphrase that i don't know whether i like or loathe br br you're an asshole you really are i mean it br br i'm guessing that this was the filmmakers secret weapon br br but the best bit about this film was the big guy that was working in the diner and decided to follow the baddies to the ghost town br br we only see him in three very short but very very crucial scenes from here on in br br scene i he is seen modifying his hammer<br br scene ii some time later he is sharpening a sickle or something i don't know maybe he was a commie br br i mean these two scenes would not be included if he had a minor role to play right br br so here is his big moment in scene iii br br scene iii the guy turns up in the heat of the battle between good and evil with his hammer in one hand and the sickle in the other he is about to deliver the final blow br br but is wiped out by one of the zombie cronies that was hanging about br br all that suspense built up and for what br br and to cap it off watch the credits roll with names like the priest and animal guy going on and on br br where were these people br br seriously though this is one film you have to watch
