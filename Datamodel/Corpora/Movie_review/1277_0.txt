for those who have not heard much about filipino cinema it must be made clear that laurice guillen is a respected figure of filipino film industry.she has played many memorable roles as its leading film actress.as a matter of fact her popularity and fame is not at all different from that of the other master woman director marilou diaz abaya.as far as this film is concerned it is weak in many ways for example-there is something fundamentally wrong with the narrative pattern which has overlapped many themes such as religion greed and the need to be over ambitious.the good thing about this film is that it can make viewers aware of the tremendous pressure an average filipino has to face when he or she is confronted with issues like religion and money.juding all these facts one can arrive at the conclusion that santa santita is an average film about globalization and how it has touched lives of certain individuals
