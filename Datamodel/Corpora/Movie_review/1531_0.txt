i remember reading reviews in the new york times and elsewhere in 1983 fawning over woody allen's brilliant and wholly original idea of inserting himself into old film footage in zelig they'd not noted of course that everyone from ernie kovacs to john zacherle had already done that brilliant and wholly original idea on television and most notably steve martin did it in a feature film dead men don't wear plaid one year prior to zelig while zelig has its moments it is ultimately tedious running about twice as long as it's one-note gag treatment can sustain in sharp contrast is the far more clever inspired fully developed insightful and witty dmdwp which as noted came out one year earlier as often happens with groundbreakers set somewhere outside the norm dmdwp was not exactly a box office hit a key reason why no sequels were ever made that's unfortunate as martin's character was one of his finest creations and could have sustained more installments in the series steve was never better on film than he is here it's good that the people behind police squad did not give up on it after it failed to fit within the confines of standard tv concepts around the same time reborn as the naked gun series of feature films the police squad concept turned into three of the greatest comedy motion pictures of all time dmdwp deserved a lot better than it got in 1982 as well and i'm glad to see that it has finally found respect and its audience through television exposure much like a previous box office bomb it's a wonderful life the kind of creativity martin carl reiner and the rest of the dmdwp crew put into their project needs to be strongly encouraged as it represents excellent comic film-making as opposed to the witless parade of routine crudities that hollywood ordinarily churns out
