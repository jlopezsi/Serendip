this movie was the type of pokemon movie i always wanted to see a lot of fun i was hooked from the first battle scene after all the previous ones i've seen havent seen 3 4 yet this one i found the best br br i like the intro to these movies as they give a brief explanation of pokemon this movie showed a few scenes from the previous movies br br the starting fight between the alien poke and the earth one was cool showing off the aliens strength for a little while br br i liked the few scenes just with poke doing amusing things with feelgood background music br br ash is the focus of course a few new characters and poke are introduced and its good to see tory make friends with those plus and minus pokemon br br after the end you see everyone board a train and go their separate ways which ended it nicely br br really enjoyable movie in the hi tech city
