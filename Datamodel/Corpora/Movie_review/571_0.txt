considering some of the reviews here and elsewhere and the lack of any big names i was more than a little skeptical going into this film my suspicions turned out to be unfounded though as the film was actually surprisingly good br br it's been a long time since i've heard a movie soundtrack where the bulk of the songs were not only performed by people born in the last 20 years but they were performed well a good soundtrack is hard to find and adds so much to a movie you can have a pretty mediocre film and add a great soundtrack and it ends up being quite watchable br br some of the acting is a little wooden and the plot is almost laughably clich one could argue though that a laughably clich plot was their goal that they were somehow trying to recreate the far-fetched plot horror flicks of years past if so they did it masterfully br br i was expecting a very low budget but it really didn't look that way i'm always impressed when low budget movies don't look low budget the editing was creative especially the ramping of the kill scenes/killer's movements for increased dramatic effect br br overall this movie portrayed something that seems to be in short supply on celluloid these days youthful exuberance if you are a teenager or if for 83 minutes you can channel the spirit of a teenager you're in for a fun ride br br with a little more money and some better writing i think these directors will be able to do really great things i'm looking forward to their next project
