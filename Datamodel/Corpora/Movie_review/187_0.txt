and you thought your significant other's family was weird wedding slashers will make you think twice about ever saying i do it is reminiscent of past horror titles such as deadly friend and friday the 13th it is a classic slasher film that features characters with names like sock monkey and the mortician you may laugh at first but trust me these guys will freak you out this is a quencher for the blood-thirsty horror/slasher fan that needs to see gore gore and more gore it's not all slash and gash either wedding slashers is chock-full-of one-liners and will give you more than just a chuckle you're going to need to see this one to believe it
