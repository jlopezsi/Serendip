i can't for my life understand what's so appealing about this show and how on earth it has such a high rating br br this is a type example of a show which just have gone on and on years after it should have been canceled the plots are utterly ridiculous including possessions by satan evil twins and mind control through chips operated into peoples brains this is what happens when the writers run out of ideas and take to bizarre stories just to keep the show running br br unless you're a fan of bad acting and ridiculous plots you should stay as far away from dool as possible
