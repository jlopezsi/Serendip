this was one of my favorite films at the santa fe film festival director connell presents us with a broad cast of dreamers and misfits his sympathetic look at these ambitious and under-appreciated performers is moving and genuine br br as a person who has been knocking at hollywood's doors for years i found myself a little frustrated by the film are my dreams folly but ultimately the message of the film has nothing to do with the sometimes ridiculous ambitions of its struggling protagonists but more with the importance of pursuing a dream come what may br br i was encouraged once to find out what i was crazy about and pursue it like a madman strictly background shows us a group of die-hards who are doing just that and their determination is inspiring br br the movie will also change the way you watch movies after watching the film it takes a long time to watch a movie without noticing the background is that a good thing sure there are no parts that do not contribute to the whole
