i first saw this in the theater with my dad at the age of 13 when it was first released he was a huge fan of classic movies and usually suffered through the stuff he took me to not this one we were both in hysterics and i'd have to say i owe my huge love of classic hollywood and global cinema to this film citizen kane it may not be but no matter i dug the humor and the atmosphere at the time and even then was aware of how much work this must have been br br i still watch this one on occasion and it is the rare comedy that has held up very well with the passage of time critics at the time seemed to write it off as a stunt but i've noted that at least a little reevaluation of dead men don't wear plaid has occurred over the years the performances as both a spoof and a love-letter to film noir are top notch with steve martin at his best here the dialog gets deep into raymond chandler/dashiell hammett hard-boiled private-eye stylishness serving up gumshoe-with-dame clich√©s just juiced up enough to give steve something to run with while still offering an a solid story the finale is magnificent martin and carl reiner jousting their way through an avalanche of every two-bit dime-store whodunnit game-over clich to ever grace the big screen cheap alibis falling like drunken angels across the naked city as the big heat descends or ahem something like that
