anyone who thinks robert altman is a brilliant director should be tied down and forced to watch this piece of garbage the original story of o.c and stiggs appeared in national lampoon and it was both uproariously funny and outrageously offensive to both genders all races and all sexual preferences robert altman turned a hilarious story into a tame lame wimpy boring movie with no laughs and no guts
