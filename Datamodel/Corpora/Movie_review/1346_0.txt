you know it never ceases to amaze me how movies can be totally blacklisted by the critics to the point of it being absolutely ridiculous and unfair excess baggage was victim to this it was a bomb however i feel it was really taken the wrong way br br silverstone plays a very cute spoiled rich girl who just wants some attention from her father so she fakes a kidnapping then locks herself in her own car del toro plays an accomplished and stylish car thief well i think you can figure out what happens next br br my thoughts of the film are this i'm a sucker for cute comedy's with adventurous story lines and that's what this is the acting isn't bad silverstone is believable and del toro is always great the chemistry on screen is just fantastic accompinied by a good soundtrack and a sexy silverstone romancing cool benicio really makes this movie a can't miss even if it's something to watch with a girlfriend or boyfriend it's one of those films from the 90's that just makes you want to go back if you are reading this and deciding to make it a date movie it has everything a good date movie has rent it tonight
