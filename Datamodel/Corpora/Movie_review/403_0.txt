of course the story of johnny lingo is one of the classics for mormon children the message it conveys is true and probably much more important today than it was at the time it was made what makes it really watchable though are the performances not their quality but on the contrary the lack thereof the acting is so stiff and inept that you will laugh tears i don't think that johnny lingo was intented as funny as it comes out but it is always worth watching beside trying to convey the message that beauty is relative inner beauty is that counts and that every one needs someone to believe in him to reach his full potential there is no reference to the mormon church or mormon beliefs at all
