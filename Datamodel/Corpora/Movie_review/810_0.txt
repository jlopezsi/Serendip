i saw this movie again recently the first time i saw it i was incredulous and the second time even more so is this really truly how health care is funded in america isn't there any kind of public system at all br br i just can't get over the apparent fact that a country that claims to be the most advanced of the so called developed countries would only have private health care it's ridiculous br br here only elective surgery is rationed hip replacements cataract surgery that kind of thing if you've got insurance then you can go private but otherwise if you've got enough points you get put on the waiting list and you eventually get your op for free the thing with the heart transplant would never happen here that sort of thing isn't covered by our main health insurance company as it's fully funded by the government br br although people are constantly winging and moaning about expensive doctor visits about nz$50 60 for an unsubsidised adult if you need to go to a e you just go in an ambulance or otherwise you don't have to ask permission br br what prey tell do people do if they can't afford health insurance
