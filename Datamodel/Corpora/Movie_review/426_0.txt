the basic plot has already been revealed a bunch of gung-ho soldiers are on a mission on an island and run into some sort of alien creature so far so good might make an entertaining movie br br however all the actors really _really_ suck they are type-cast in a way which makes it obvious from the very beginning how they will react to any situation the next problem is that the plot is as boring and predictable as the actors unless you are somewhat challenged you are always at lest two steps ahead of the movie and nothing will surprise you br br whatever you feel like watching just ignore this film it is a complete waste of time
