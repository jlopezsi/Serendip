i enjoyed this movie a lot as a kid as i enjoyed the flash guns and the other nifty computer stuff this movie also has a bit of nudity in it funny considering this movie was rated pg it even has a couple of good deaths in it too just not the kind of stuff you would find in a movie these days unless it were just showing a male butt on screen here you get brief images of models and it is quite nice to look at the plot has a plastic surgeon's patients dying off what is strange is that none of these women seem to need any surgery to begin with one particular girl kind of gets close to the doctor and through a series of events they uncover strange going ons this movie is very entertaining as it has it all it seems good action here and there some mystery and some nice imagery you also have a cool flash gun that stuns a person for a good while when used it also has its rather funny scenes as a couple of those deaths that happen when they are filming those bad commercials are just great the cast is rather good too as albert finney may not be an action star but he does really good here james coburn is also very good and they have a nice assortment of attractive girls too they just do not make them like this anymore unfortunately
