this movie was a nice surprise,the cast did a great job and thora birch showed she can be a very diverse actress.i will buy this dvd very soon,so i can share it with my friends and get their thought on it.i don't agree that this qualify's as a true horror movie but the directer does a great job!with the script,and the actors earned their money.great movie with a lot of good guessing and some on the edge of your seat moments.the american audience has a different view on most english made movies i think not enough of them make it to the states to be seen!this should have had advertising and a lot of promotion along with a movie premier,with the cast on hand opening night the studio would have made a great deal more money with this one
