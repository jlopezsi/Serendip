i won't comment about the acting or plot there's plenty of that here already what i'd rather do is call attention to the visuals the cinematography lighting costuming and especially the set design br br normally horror films take place in ancient settings crude medieval fortresses and rustic castles that are dark cluttered and gloomy but this one is set in a perversely utopian sci-fi fantasy the clean lined impeccably detailed generously glazed modernistic and usually radiantly lit white-and-silver upper floor interiors of the house br br the lower floor is an expressionistic prison also clean lined but still dungeon-like with its windowless walls of exposed board-formed concrete an elegant steel spiral staircase connects the two and the angular expressionism reaches its culmination in the chamber used for the black mass br br karloff's costumes recall oskar schemmer's bauhaus-produced work angular broad-shouldered narrow-waisted and elegant even the haircut of this man of the future in sharp and angular his character is an engineer and architect and is given the name poelzig of a famous expressionist german architect and film set designer of the time who was a colleague of the director on an earlier film the elegant futurism in carried down to the detail level including a digital night-table clock and an abstract chess set much of the genius of this movie is that it breaks the horror-movie visual mold and floods it with light creating a fascinating tension between plot and setting
