what was joan crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle br br a woman and her gang of thieves plan to steal gems from a wealthy family crawford as mrs cheney is that woman who plays up to robert montgomery in order to be invited to the home of his wealthy aunt br br the crawford character is in cahoots with william powell the film goes bad as this is a comedy had this been a drama with crawford playing a brassy woman this would have been something otherwise the film goes downhill quickly once crawford has been found out crazily a letter has been sent by frank morgan one of the aristocrats to mrs cheney which describes the negative side of these wealthy patrons crawford and powell try getting some money out of morgan and when they do they promptly relinquish it powell goes willingly to jail while mrs cheney finds her true love in montgomery to believe this misery you have to be quite a fool o yes jesse ralph is around as the dowager aunt even her hearty laugh can't save this mess of a film
