o.c and stiggs is one of my favorite movies it is hilarious and awful at the same time exactly what every good comedy should be although it is hailed as one of altman's worst films i think it has a certain charm it captures a feeling of the freedom of adolescence as well as the bizarre humor of true friendship i can relate to much of their antics the movie is at times downright meanspirited but it is a movie for pete's sake plus it is nowhere near as raunchy as the national lampoon articles it is based on br br in true altman form the dialogue is subtle and overlapping and you may have to watch it a few times to get the best jokes bear with it if you've got an off-kilter sense of humor you'll truly enjoy it
