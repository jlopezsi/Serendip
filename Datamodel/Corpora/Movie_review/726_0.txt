analyze this 1999 br br it has been a long time since i have seen a comic duo form a better shtick than robert deniro and billy crystal in the mob comedy analyze this a smart amusing satire from director harold ramis multiplicity groundhog day for a movie like this to succeed past a commercial level chemistry between the main characters must be amiable and spirited crystal and deniro indeed mold amiable incentive between themselves therefore quite a few hilarious moments emerge from their perception of the well-written script by kenneth lonergan peter tolan and ramis himself br br analyze this details the lives of two very different individuals the first person is played by billy crystal a calm cool and collected psychiatrist named ben sobol who is divorced with a young teenage son and is engaged to soon wed a resigning tv reporter named laura macnamara lisa kudrow ben is currently dealing with a emotional patient molly shannon distressed because her spouse left and filed a restraining order on her this woman's problems will seem like nothing when ben obtains his new client br br robert deniro plays the second person this movie examines the most powerful mobster in the city of new york paul vitti he and his accomplices including a chubby and clumsy bodyguard named jelly joe viterelli are in the process of significant business when vitti experiences an anxiety attack on the road to a nervous breakdown this emotionally vulnerable man comes to ben after jelly briefly encounters the therapist during a minor car accident ben is very nervous with his new patient who forces compliments and demands upon him br br the first confrontation sequence between ben and paul is quite engaging there is an instant odd couple chemistry among the two characters the witty sessions sobol and vitti consummate are also very imaginative and smart the scenes also have the intelligence to take vitti's emotional problems seriously br br the setup accurately introduces both the gangsters and the psychiatrist's family we understand the mob boss's feelings of stress and depression this picture is not all shallow slapstick comedy there is a dimensional human touch the film takes its conflicts seriously but executes them in a cute humorous style the audience can also relate to billy crystal's character who is an average joe with a typical american family in a complicated situation in which he is not entirely sure how to handle br br both external and internal conflicts are interestingly accomplished well structured presented and written the film does a good job of convincingly bringing the world of mobsters to life with well-cast actors and their rich stylish accents br br paul vitti's sexual life needed more exploration although his adulterous intentions do induce a few laughs the story could have gone somewhere with his infidelity vitti's family is also irresolute the film almost never portrays them on screen and seldom does paul himself discuss his children and wife the lisa kudrow character is furthermore underwritten never thoroughly examined and very shallow the lack of chemistry amid kudrow and crystal leads to the unconvincing relationship ben occupies br br robert deniro is the perfect option for the comic role of paul vitti who is a more difficult character than it may appear deniro triggers a sharp comic edge and gives the right amount of exaggerated sentimentality to vitti lisa kudrow is fun to watch producing a dim-minded character whimsically similar to the one in her hit tv sitcom friends chazz palminteri and joe viterelli contribute different but energetic supporting roles br br analyze this is unmistakably the right kind of movie for billy crystal i am unaware of another hollywood comedian who could have conquered his role with more proficiency and mirth he is one of the main components that makes analyze this work well harold ramis's comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like grosse point blank and mafia but as this production proves just because it was done before doesn't mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting br br br br
