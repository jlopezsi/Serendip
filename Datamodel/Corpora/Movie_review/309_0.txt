on a desolate planet two factions are at war with each other but there is another menace out there tunneling beneath the ground an autonomous mobile sword or screamer is an incredibly quick weapon named for its high-pitched shrieking and which cuts its victims into pieces it turns out these weapons seem to be evolving on their own and become capable of taking on new forms br br based on a philip k dick novel his works have also inspired the films blade runner and total recall this is better than your run-of-the-mill filmed-in-canada b-movie slowly deliberately paced dialog heavy subtle and atmospheric it's rewarding for those who stick with it it looks quite impressive special effects are excellent rarely ever getting overtly cheesy and the indoor outdoor sets and location work are phenomenal the snowy windswept landscape is photographed quite well overall it's quite a nice film to look at br br co-scripted by dan o'bannon of alien fame that gives it some extra punch as he always tends to do quite well in the realm of science-fiction the acting is good peter weller is a stalwart and refreshingly not one-note hero and is supported capably by roy dupuis the rocket andy lauer and the lovely jennifer rubin a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors bad dreams some of the characters are abrasive although that thankfully never became too much of a distraction the story twists are actually not ones that really surprised me but i appreciated the story-telling in general br br screamers is a nice little surprise worth looking into for science-fiction buffs who have yet to see it it's bleak chilly interesting and reasonably entertaining stuff i recommend it br br 7/10
