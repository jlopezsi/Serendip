this movie is being promoted as a new jackie chan flick don't be taken in having seen(and really enjoyed)his last 3 movies i eagerly waited in line for my ticket once the film got to present day the film starts with jackie's characters birth i waited and waited and waited for anything resembling the humour and action of his most recent films it didn't come and hadn't come when i walked out almost an hour later the technology alone was enough to make any modern film goer cringe you could actually see the blue line between the 2 jackies all i can say is that jackie chan must have signed and released the rights to this film long long ago i will go and see the next jackie chan film but only after checking the production date poor jackie
