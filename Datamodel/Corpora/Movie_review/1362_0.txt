i rented this movie thinking that everybody had been too hard on poor alicia who had been wonderful in clueless and sexy in many an aerosmith video i was wrong it might have been due in part to the non-existent script but alicia showed no screen presence at all instead she smoked and drank during the entire flick is this the moviemakers attempt to appeal to the teenage crowd this movie is aimed at benicio del toro's performance was all right even though or because he seemed to think he was in a remake to the usual suspects in all if you see only a hundred movies this year don't let this one be one of them
