being a fan of comedians such as laurel and hardy marx brothers and various other comics from that era i watched this film wanting to give wheeler and woolsey a chance to prove to me they belong among the aforementioned i found their style of humor very dull the jokes were lame and the accompanied antics similar to that seen from a hyperactive pre-teen the storyline was somewhat inventive and would have worked much better with a more talented duo the sole reason to watch this film would be to see thelma todd and dorothy lee perhaps i need to watch a couple more wheeler and woolsey films before i cast them aside but i can almost bet the other offerings would be simply more of the same
