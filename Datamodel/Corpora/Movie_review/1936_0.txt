i don't know why this movie got so much criticism i thought it was pretty good sure the effects might not have been the best but it was still a great movie the original jaws was one of if not the greatest movies of all time that's a tough act to follow any way you look at it jaws 3 also had some great actors including dennis quaid and bess armstrong you can say what you want but i'll always love jaws 3
