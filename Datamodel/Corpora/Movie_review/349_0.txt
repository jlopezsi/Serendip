i am very disappointed that i watched all the seasons of deadwood not because the show was disappointing but because the show ended this was a show that was 360 degrees of amazing a show that hit that gritty side of life in a way that leaves you feeling satisfied with its honesty br br i really feel unsatisfied with the way hbo finished deadwood i am not foolish enough to think that it is all about me but after reading the web blog's and feeling other viewers comments i know that i am not alone br br when and if hbo ever does anything about this i will be there to pick up where deadwood left me
