i like movies i have sat through some awful tripe because i feel that like people everybody has a good side so i wait for films to show me something mildly visually compelling a moment's genius amidst an otherwise pointless mess of celluloid rubbish most of the time i am able to take solace in the fact that even matrix revolutions had at least a few seconds of high-speed visceral action despite the unfathomable script and plot br br birth on the other hand was the filmic equivalent of a very long wait i have had more fun standing at a bus stop with the flu in the rain br br besides the technical issues the alarmingly regular appearance of boom mics and the plot holes the kid sean's inexplicable ability to point out lauren bacall as the xmas humbug birth's script is virtually non-existent and ponderous kubrick style tracking shots sap the very life blood out of the viewer so that they are lulled into a hypnotic half-slumber i am sure that detectives have been faced with a rash of mysterious deaths where victims have been found on their sofas dribbling out of the corner of their mouths eyes open gazing zombie-like to the end credits of birth br br this film could have been squeezed just as meaningfully into a 2 minute short if you take out the scene where we are forced to look at kidmans face at the concert for an age the straight-repeated scenes standing in for flashbacks and the lengthy silences filled with supposedly drama-filled facial expressions which don't lead us to an explanation of the plot any more than a stray fart in a lift you would be left with hello i am your dead husband in a child's body no i am not i am a misguided teen with a boring life and i've pieced together a bit of information about you to try and see your boobies in the bath deeply suspect bath scene by the way br br oh and nicole kidman reminded me of a loveless and neurotic icy-frigid aunt not a hint of a deeply emotional soul who still pines for her long-dead hubby 10 years wasn't it i would have been able to understand her acceptance of sean mark 2 if we had been shown just for a moment or two some scenes featuring her previous deep relationship with sean mark 1 br br all you art-house types should really stop looking for a deeper meaning in this movie it's a lazy piece of film making and i half expect that the director has a hefty reliance on downers br br side note that fella who plays kidman's husband is seriously scary-looking i reckon he'd be a good devil
