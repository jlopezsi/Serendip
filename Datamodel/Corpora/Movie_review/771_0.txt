not sure that you'll get a comment from anyone of my generation the depression-ridden 30's about the emerald forest but here goes anyway br br i first became aware of the term ecology when i signed up for a masters-level college class of the same name in 1965 it was the first formalization of the study of ecology on the west coast i took it simply because i needed a natural science credit and all the other classes were full the class changed my life and my perspectives i devoured rachel carson and savored movies like dances with wolves and medicine man i even joined green peace at the age of 32 and suspect that i am probably the only republican in history that can make that claim br br i would vote that emerald forest is the best of all popular eco-message dramas it is my all time favorite it is so well done in every area script acting photography and re-enactment of tribal customs at the same time it delivers a powerful message that can only be dismissed by the most callous of personalities every time i see the movie i am filled with regret that i could never accomplish such a landmark cinematographic ecological statement br br i was also filled with the emotion to go to brazil and blow away anyone with a chainsaw
