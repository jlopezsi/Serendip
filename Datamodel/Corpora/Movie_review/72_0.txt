i saw this movie by accident and i love it since br br i got the dvd and in quiet moments i dig it out and watch it again br br it's one of those rare films that keeps you watching while the story is flying by the characters fits the story and i also like the energy between the characters the chosen music is excellent and keeps everything together br br i wouldn't say it's realistic that a boy rapes an unconscious women but who never dreamed of an unconscious girl p br br in the end julietta tries to make everything work and that makes her character even more appealing br br i love the persons and the music great film br br and to the others who always compare one film with another live is not that easy to compare like the title says greetings
