i like sci-fi movies and everything bout it and aliens so i watched this flick nothing new nothing special average acting typical h b davenport story weak and cheesy fx's bad ending of movie but still the author idea is good the marines on lost island find the truth about alien landing there and truth about past-experiments on them they die one after one some of them were killed by lonely alien and others by human enemies ufo effects when it flees and crushes are bad,too the voices of angry alien are funny,too reminds me on young monkeys the movie is not scary not very funny maybe the old man which marines find on the lost island is the funniest freak in the movie he's all confused and he dances all the time like old drunk a little better sequel than xtro 2 second encounter and 3-times weakest than the original movie as i say for the hardest fans only
