don't get me wrong there have been great westerns to come before deadwood but none of them really got it right there is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and tv we're finally starting to see the truth david milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west watching the cast of deadwood converse with a combination of old world english laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time where do people think our language came from people always want to think that they were the first to do something when things like profanity substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect br br along with the incredible dialog and storytelling david milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to tv or film al swearengen ian mcshane plays al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by in al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making i don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced br br this is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves
