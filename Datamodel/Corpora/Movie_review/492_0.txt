the paper-thin plot of this movie is much more amusing or perhaps much closer to being amusing would be more accurate if you saw the original also a must-have but the plot is not the point i was born in new orleans in the first half of this century and i have watched sadly as the music i came to know and love as a child has quietly died pace don mclean br br from taj mahal's incredibly earthy a cappella rendition of john the revelator later given a full-chorus reprise in what for me was the zenith of the movie to the outrageously over-the-top closing battle of the bands encore the music is the mississippi from new orleans thru memphis to st louis and thence to chicago culturally even if not geographically a child of the father of waters whenever i feel a twinge of nostalgia i no longer have to drive down to memphis i just drop in this dvd and smile br br it's obvious to me that the cast of this movie was on a mission from god to leave a legacy to those who come after and have never known the real thing thanks guys ya done good
