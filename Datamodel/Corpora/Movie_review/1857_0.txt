when i was watching this i could straight away pick many of the different aspects quentin tarantino took from this everything from the plot especially the music and the effects was copied and warped in a way although i marginally liked kill bill better this is still an extremely good movie that i think everyone should see br br this movie is set in chapters where we follow yuki who is out to avenge her mothers rape and torture there were four culprits one of whom was killed by the mother already so yuki from the moment she was born was trained to eventually kill the three remaining villains br br as you can see the plot was almost entirely copied for kill bill but i find the plot in this one slightly more interesting the music was extremely good and quite moving two of the songs were actually used in kill bill the effects are the traditional over the top ones you would expect lots of severed limbs and gushing blood br br this gets a solid 4 5
