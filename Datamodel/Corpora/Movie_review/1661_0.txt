fred astaire and ginger rogers despite being on the front cover are not the main stars the main stars happen to be irene dunne and randolph scott and you do not want to watch dunne sing since she is awful and scott doesn't even try to dance or sing which is a good thing astaire and rogers are the best thing in this movie and you get to hear rogers have a swedish accent the romance between scott and dunne just isn't very interesting and you would be best off by skipping the parts when dunne sings i don't even see why dunne and scott were cast in this film and you should really only watch it if you happen to be a big fan of astaire or rogers
