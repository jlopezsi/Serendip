i said in my gamera vs zigra review that that was the worst of the gamera films i was mistaken gamera vs jiger is the worst of the gamera films br br basically in this film gamera must save mankind from jiger jiger is a monster who came back because some construction workers take away a statue that supposedly keeps jiger from escaping jiger manages to stab gamera in the neck and put some eggs into him that later hatch into little jigers br br first of all this film has the worst looking of any of gamera's foes jiger looks pretty cheaply built and does not look all that interesting jiger is a female due to the fact that it lays eggs se had potential and looks kind of like a prehistoric amphibian with a fin on his back jiger can shoot spears out of her head and kind of hover over water by shooting gas out of her body mainly jiger's face just looks lame just a bad looking cheap monster br br gamera also is looking bad in this film i do not know how many different gamera suits were made but this one looks really bad br br there are a lot of parts that i just thought were bad like how the two kids take a submarine into gamera's body i am not a big fan of traveling into the body of other creatures even in films it just looks odd br br the monster fighting is nothing new just same old stuff the only really interesting aspect of this film is how jiger infects gamera with eggs of hers that later hatch inside of gamera but for the most part the monster action is not exciting and just the same old stuff br br the dubbing is pretty bad as usual why would the one guy make a gun noise and gesture when telling everybody the two children should have taken the undersea gun with them and did they really have to show the people cutting open the elephant trunk and pulling out all the larvae that were inside disgusting br br a pretty bad monster film the worst gamera film i have ever seen not recommended
