i got this movie in the mail a few days ago i watched it in black and white cause the colour would not appear on my dvd player anyway i saw the whole movie and i was not very pleased about it the host mark taylor a large man in dress suit which tell about what you will see next and say to many times what you are about to see next is shocking yes a few things are shocking like the scenes where iraq soldiers breaks bones on prisoners they also cut tongues of people at one stage in movie mark taylor ask us make up our minds on this what is worst the abu ghraib prison case or what the iraq army does to people we are then shown a series of non brutal images from the abu ghraib prison followed by extreme grotesque videos from iraq this is wrong br br the movie it self is very good produced good image quality and some neat extra features but i find this movie to politically incorrect i have much movies in this genre shockumentary but i tend to like them best when they stay without any political views
