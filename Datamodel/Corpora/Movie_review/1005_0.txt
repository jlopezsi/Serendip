if you are a fan of zombie-movies this one will disappoint you this is a movie without any good ideas there are no thrills and shock-effects the make-up is lousy too and there was no money for special effects the whole thing looks like a bad joke a home video from a few crazy kids br br if you are a fan of the actors who appear here you will be disappointed too because their appearances are much too short br br zombiegeddon is a bad movie very boring no story no absolutely no action and a real waste of a few good b-movie-legends scream-queen brinke stevens she was about 50 when she made this one real beauty never fades has a few good moments tom savini the legendary sex-machine in tarantino/rodriguez from dusk till dawn is wasted here too his scene is not worth to mention and he isn't as cool here as we remember him from other movies br br maniac cop robert z'dar appears almost at the end of the movie and he hasn't much to do in here julie strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers br br conrad brooks the young cop from ed woods plan 9 from outer space appears also here but why a few famous b-movie legends can't even save this garbage br br joe estevez seems to be the only actor who really enjoyed his work his appearances are really funny william smith as lord zombie in his terrible costume with his terrible helmet looks like he would say oh my god what am i doing here when will i ever get a part in a real movie most of the scenes look like they were shot in 1 or 2 hours another funny thing is that the makers talk in the making-of about kung-fu fighting zombies but what they are doing is kickboxing hey guys wake up there is a difference between kung-fu and kickboxing br br this dvd includes also one of the worst and most boring making-ofs i've ever seen it looks like even the guys who mad this movie were completely desinterrested in their work br br all in all zombiegeddon is a waste of time and a waste of money
