what a confusing weird horror movie this is the director was obviously on drugs but who can explain the editing mess the editor was probably very high when working on the final print i mean there is no coherence between most events and it's like you are watching 5 different movies in the style of crash or amores perros br br the sad truth is that this failure is considered as a slasher movie with dramatic over tones it tries to be like the texas chainsaw massacre but with an 80's slasher feeling it just doesn't works br br the acting is atrocious not to mention the horrible direction that looks like an amateur flick the only good thing about this one may be the soundtrack which is fairly good and fits with the movie's weirdness br br this movie is well known among b-fans as the movie where the killer uses a richard nixon mask br br plase avoid this bizarre mess it's just too bad to be bad
