jaws 3-d is a trashy second sequel to jaws that's more likely to turn viewers stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat br br the premise sees biologists dennis quaid and bess armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at florida's seaworld however the manager louis gosset jr makes a careless decision and the shark dies within hours the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge br br dan on the previous page clearly stated the mystery of carl gottleib co-writer of jaws and jaws ii coming up with this idea actually it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like quaid and gosset jr but it turned out to be a thumbs-down the film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense the shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at amity it looks fake roars and swims or rather crawls at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness but of course its just a model and so the direction is really to blame br br fortuanately its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm its just a big shame that joe alves has taken things so far off the rails
