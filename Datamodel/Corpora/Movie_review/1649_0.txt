this was a very very early full-length film according to the video box it was the first full-length american-made film but that is debatable as several films have made that claim and exactly what constitutes full-length is pretty vague regardless i have to commend the cast for trying something unique and epic though in today's light the film is a totally boring mess and only of interest to cinephiles instead of the modern notion of story-telling and action the crew was breaking new ground and made a bizarre film that appears more like a series of vignettes instead of a coherent film instead of a moving and evolving narrative like we are used to the film was made with a real-life traveling acting troop but instead of having them act out the story the film shows inter-title cards that describe what has occurred and the cast pose like they are going to be photographed or just make a few minimal movements or actions until the next card appears to describe an all-new scene it's almost like looking at a series of stereoscope cards that move just a little and all together tell a very very dull story very static and horrid to watch it did try something different and this is an amazingly important film historically i just would never want to have to watch it again
