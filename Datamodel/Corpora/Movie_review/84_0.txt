this according to most was not the best film of all time and perhaps they're right but one never knows just what can happen when you see a film my winter vacation had already been planned when one monday evening in february 1982 i saw sst disaster in the sky one of its other names it only took me til friday to call my travel agent and change my destination from columbus ohio to dakar senegal i took off within a few days and with no hotel old french and a small bag i landed in dakar it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life for that reason this movie for me is a 10 no one ever said that a film had to win oscars in every category to have a profound effect on the viewer this one did it for me and that is why i watch it whenever it's on tv unfortunately so many years have passed that no channel shows it anymore ah if only there were a dvd i'd buy it immediately
