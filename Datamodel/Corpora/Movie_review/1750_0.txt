this final fantasy is one of the best to date great summons amazing cinemas and the best storyline of any video game and alot of movies lately the relationship between the characters is just amazing and streches throughout the game learning more and more about their past until in the end it all comes together perfectly but the best part has to be the connection between renoa and squall the emotions of the two are clear but watching them to see what happens next is the best part and the games theme song eyes on me will bring a tear to your eye
