this was a modern-day version of a 1940s narrative gangster film also known as film noir but with a different twist steve martin rachel ward and a few others actors are seen talking to many classic stars of the past as director carl reiner used clips of those films to fake conversations with the up-to-date real actors of this film they made it appear that alan ladd barbara stanwyck humphrey bogart et al were actually talking to martin br br obviously the more acquainted you are with those film noirs the more fun this movie will be as you try to recognize what movie those clips came from the answers are shown in the ending credits that's the fun part of this movie br br the not-so-fun part is simply trying to figure how what is happening in the first place the plot is not always easy to discern and it's doubly difficult because of the constant interruptions with the classic film scene inserted in the story you get so captivated watching those old stars that you lose track of the storyline br br that's a big reason i don't think this film ever caught on that much the story is too convoluted just too hard to follow br br ward was great to watch and martin was annoying after awhile if ward doesn't look like the embodiment of a 1940s film goddess i don't know who does that and the razor sharp black-and-white picture with the real actors is nice to see but martin who dominates the film overdoes the stupid comments i would like to have seen this film played a little straighter like a real noir it's a clever film but sometimes too clever for its own good
