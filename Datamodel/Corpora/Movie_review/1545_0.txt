i don't know of any other wayne film before the forgettable 47 tycoon that was filmed in color all those classic 40s republic westerns and war movies were filmed in b&w after his epic b&w western union pacific demille had the clout to insist all his future works be filmed in technocolor a rare luxury treatment in the 40s color became much more common and eventually standard as the 50s rolled on this was a very important edge hollywood had over tv in the 50s until color tvs became common in the 60s br br this film is perhaps my favorite wayne flick(if we can consider it a wayne film as he didn't get top billing i've seen it several times the technicolor treatment is certainly one reason but i'm also hooked on demille's better films(in spite of several other fine 39 westerns union pacific is my clear favorite for that year the general style of the present film apes that of gone with the wind to which it is often disparagingly compared i've never been a big fan of the latter if given a choice i would see demille's film again it is also commonly compared to wayne's latter film the wake of the red witch which i have not seen but is said to be largely a reworked version of the present film br br considering the age of this film i thought the dvd transfer quality excellent with vivid colors from the included background extras we learn that much of the shooting took place on location in charleston and the key west area however the under water scenes were done in a huge tank both paulette goddard and susan hayward tried out for the role of scarlett in gone with the wind it is speculated that ms goddard lost out partly because of her uncertain official relationship with her lover of recent years charlie chaplin by the time the present film was begun this relationship was over br br there are many complexities to this film and so many interesting if sometimes stock characters i thought all the main characters and most of the supporting characters were well cast captain jack and steve tolliver seemed destined to be at each other's throats throughout the story yet occasionally they fought together against a common enemy and helped the other in a desperate situation captain jack is a tragic character sometimes in hot water through no fault of his own yet performing a dastardly deed to help win his love that precipitates the demise of many of the main characters raymond massey sheds his lincoln and john brown images to become an engaging masterful villain i found his performance in the courtroom as captain jack's lawyer riveting in fact the whole courtroom scene was masterfully done in one of the many convoluted relationships susan hayward's character falls for massey's handsome younger brother who lives in his brother's shadow as a marginal villain this romance on the sneak will become central to the tragic and redemptive events near the end of the story i thought the talking dog and mischievous pet capuchin served well to provide some comic relief i also enjoyed lynne overman's portrayal of captain phil a classic old salt and grandfatherly figure my main gripe is i didn't like the ending the parting scene specifically it just didn't ring plausible or just
