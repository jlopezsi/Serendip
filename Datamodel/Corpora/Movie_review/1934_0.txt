you know they should make a dvd boxset consisting of jaws 2 jaws 4 and jesus this crap that is jaws 3 why well in simple terms it could be used as an extreme torture device dvd quality making the pain even worse i won't say anything about the plot even though there is not one but i will say something about the dazzling state-of-the-art special effects the only thing that salvages the movie basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine unbelievable you wouldn't think for one minute that they were using a miniature centre made from yogurt pots or a diving machine so super-imposed one side of it totally disappears in one scene nah great sfx they could even be compared to the might of the doctor who films made in the sixties with flying saucers on strings etc oh sorry i forgot they weren't actually made from yogurt pots br br you can probably figure out that i dislike this movie a lot and you'd be right but please take note from this review when carl gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought we'd have on ok movie it turns out that looking at a dog turd for 90 minutes would give you more adrenaline rushes than this total tosh
