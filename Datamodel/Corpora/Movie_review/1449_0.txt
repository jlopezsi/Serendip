i'm a great fan of rags to riches stories having lived the riches to rags to riches life personally the idea is quite appealing to me what i found so interesting about jeremy piven's character was that he was so enamored with sherilyn fenn's character that he saw through the obvious he wasn't looking at the superficial yes she was pretty and very rich but that wasn't his motivation he was truly motivated by gasp love his countenance and his boyish body language when he would be around her was so wonderful to watch and how a bond and a friendship developed between the two characters was simply delicious sherilyn fenn's character i thought was implausible knowing today's standards however i loved the thought of knowing that a beautiful young rich single and famous actress could have such a deep longing for true love and faithfulness where do you find that nowadays br br it's in this story br br the movie was so passionate and poignant the characters so innocently appealing and the supporting cast was simply tremendous i can't say enough good things about this film who cares if its an independent who cares if its low budget a good romance doesn't need the big hollywood hype or the big production it simply needs two characters that truly and deeply love each other and are willing to look beyond the superficial attitudes that most of us have grown accustomed to
