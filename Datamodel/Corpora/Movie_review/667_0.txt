sorta kinda spoilers in here but if you've read the other reviews on imdb there's nothing new most aren't familiar with the manuel romasanta story no reason why they should and when they see the dvd case i'm not familiar with theatrical hype they are quite justified in picking it up expecting a werewolf film they are also quite justified in being disappointed they are victims of sleight of hand marketing don't know where the decision was made but whoever even chose to present the blurb in the tradition of the howling nope in the tradition of gothic maybe i enjoyed this movie but i think i enjoyed because when i learned it was coming and being the curious person i am i dug into the story of manuel romasanta this is my suggestion to those who have not seen this movie 1 light up your internet and put manuel romasanta into your favorite search engine ignore all hits that pertain to this movie and collect a little history about a real life and seminal serial killer 2 rent the movie understanding it is not in the tradition of the howling watch it and decide how these folks handled a murky historical incident involving clinical lycanthropy br br i think they did a nice job
