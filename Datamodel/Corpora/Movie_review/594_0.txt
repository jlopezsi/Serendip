much better than the earlier julius caesar which starred marlon brando as mark antony and james mason as brutus in this version jason robards as brutus is admittedly an embarrassment but the rest of the cast is quite strong the delivery of antony's funeral oration by charlton heston is brilliant powerful well-paced the dramatic high point of the movie richard johnson as cassius john gielgud as caesar robert vaughn as casca and diana rigg as portia are fine actors with full dramatic presence at home in shakespeare's language brief parts like the soothsayer's and the cobbler's are memorably played the screenplay omits two short passages that are important to the plot 1 cassius avowal in the first act after his attempt to persuade brutus to oppose caesar that if their positions were reversed and he cassius stood as well with caesar as brutus does and brutus made a comparable appeal to him he would certainly not listen 2 immediately after the assassination a promise by brutus to antony's servant of safe conduct for antony who thus knows when he comes to the capitol and weeps over caesar's body challenging the conspirators to kill him also that there is no danger of their doing so
