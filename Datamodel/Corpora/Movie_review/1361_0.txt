i have to admit there was something really undefined i loved about this movie yeah the script needed a little work and maybe the actors could have done a tit bit of a better job but overall it really touched me in that sweet/sadistic way br br i mean that's what we all want right to be cared about and it just shows how far sometimes people will go for it and oh yeah benicio del toro is such a triple threat he's extremely hot he's italian and he's an amazing actor so whatever movie you put him in it has a really good chance of touching someone overall i give this movie a 7 i think it deserves at least that
