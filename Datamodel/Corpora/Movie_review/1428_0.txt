i almost turned this movie off during the first 10 minutes i decided to continue watching it to see if there really was a plot buried amidst all of the other shortcomings of the film there are several things that you should know that are bound to annoy the typical war movie viewer 1 stupid music some of the worst i have ever heard it reminds me of the old spaghetti westerns 2 it's a dubbed movie i'm not a fan of movies that are dubbed i'd rather watch them in the language they were shot in and read captions in this case it's worse because the americans and the germans are both dubbed and have no accents what-so-ever in some really dark scenes you don't know if you are watching the germans or the americans 3 authenticity there are so many inconsistencies with weaponry uniforms etc that it's hard to tell who is who and who they are shooting at even the germans shoot at the other germans who are hiding behind a tank early in the movie yet later in pitch black one of the men can identify the lieutenant from 1/4 of a mile away as he walks down a hillside 4 dialogue war movies are about war guns explosions and people fighting there are some really odd cut scenes there is one with a prostitute where a soldier trying to teach her about humanities indecency she's not interested she just wants the 64 dollars most of the dialog reminds me of watching japanese anime br br if you watched it this far you might as well know that it doesn't get any better all of the actors have perfected rolling down hills as they die apparently gravity always pulls you towards a camera man never away br br all in all a complete waste of time unless you are just looking for a movie with cheesy dialog there's always something better than this to watch
