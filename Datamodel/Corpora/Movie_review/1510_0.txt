from the first time i saw this in the first-run theaters i thought this movie would garner at the very least some editing awards br br but as we always see in these affairs the really great contributions to cinema are woefully ignored intentionally overlooked or baked over by the interests groups of the powers that be payolas br br this is a masterpiece of construction in visuals script set decoration and so many other technical awards as with zelig it is only now that people are lauding its true worth br br i feel that something should be done to elevate this movie to its rightful place in the annals of creative wizardry
