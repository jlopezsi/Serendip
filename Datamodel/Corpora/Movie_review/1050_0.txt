i must admit that if seeing paul in mid rant were my only knowledge of him i would share other's concerns about his teaching methods but let's face it he was playing to the camera and 6-9 months worth of interactions were condensed down to the most entertaining cursing sessions you could see the counter balance to the rants in the end sequences there was much affection expressed all around br br but lets focus on the film here it is funny moving and shows what kids can do when expectations are high go and see this film if you like to see kids amaze you and surpass their teacher br br rock school is not for all kids it has been a source of great growth both musical and personal for one of my kids but i know that it would not be the right fit for his sibling so for those of you who are stuck on why any parent would pay to submit their child to this abuse i would say that in reality many different wonderful teachers including paul are involved with this school and just as this movie will enhance an evening this school is enhancing many lives
