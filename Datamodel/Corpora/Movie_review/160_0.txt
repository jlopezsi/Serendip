this movie is sad beyond words beyond tears of course,the unstated truth is that elizabeth is right by joining the raf drew is probably sealing his fate a different but equally sad truth is stated when elizabeth accuses erik of being perhaps the one who killed john and he concurs because he did kill john rather than returning a lesser perhaps unmanned husband the horror of war and the fact that it is sometimes necessary for us to go on sad beyond words beyond tears and beyond bearing some historians believe that war is man's natural state of being and that would give this old movie currency beyond the coincidence of whether a big war is happening when the movie is viewed it is always true and always sad sad beyond words
