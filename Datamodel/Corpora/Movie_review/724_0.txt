this wasn't hilarious as everyone told me it was but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment although a comedy it has violence and a lot of profanity br br robert de niro as usual is excellent and once again surprises viewers with his comedic talent he plays a mobster familiar territory but one who needs psychiatric help he's hilarious when he's crying his shrink is played by billy crystal in an untypical low-key character role my favorite in this film was joe viterelli the fat guy-mobster who has a few very funny lines viterelli is one of these guys you see in a ton of gangster movies and is always interesting br br the female lead in here lisa kudrow laura was not appealing to me character-wise overall a funny movie and much better than the sequel
