i bought radioactive dreams because of micheal dudikof i have liked american ninja since i was a child and i wanted to see the lead actor in another role in rd dudikof plays a fool bottom line i was a little irritated by the annoying 80s music and singing but i enjoyed being able to look back at the 80s art of b level crap you don't see things like this anymore this is unmistakable 80s and think that it is not a good movie but a lot of movies aren't good movies it is as many people say if you go into it with the right mindset a movie such as this can actually be entertaining basically two brothers are locked in a bomb shelter all their lives because a nuclear explosion occurred the two brothers finally come outside into the world as teens young men what the want is to get with women but then they find themselves on a mission to save the world there are many characters in this film not great characters but unique one such as a gang of scary mutant biker chicks
