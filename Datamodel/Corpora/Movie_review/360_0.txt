i found this to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie as a schoolteacher i am always glad to find something i can show my students that does not use profanity have excessive violence sexual content or have other things that might be labeled objectionable the acting is quite good despite the fact that most of the actors are not well known they are believable and none of them are show stealers particularly interesting is the way in which joey's nemesis reese goes back and forth in his views of joey there are enough interesting sub-plots like this to keep the viewer interested movies of this type seem to be increasingly difficult to come by one young hero is truly family-oriented and entertains without being sugary
