i can't understand how someone can do such thing i don't know if it was independent movie or what but i never saw so bad image like every scene was blur or something)in a movie even in independent ones the script is predictable the actors are bad acting trying to make scenes funny instead they have come ridiculous so why did i watch it someone can ask because my kids 11 and 13yo asked us to watch any movie in the tv with them then i suggested them to choose one and they did but even they didn't like it it should be better if they had chosen other films at nickelodeon or disney channel that are re-run several times a week my time wouldn't be so wasted as it was and this movie was played at prime time on hbo family
