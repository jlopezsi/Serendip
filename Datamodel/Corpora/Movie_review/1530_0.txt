an incredible achievement my mind boggles at the amount of thought time and effort that must have gone into this superb film the plot is brilliantly and hilariously convoluted with screen legends from the 1940s making appearances in amazingly edited scenes and steve martin's trademark absurd humour is present almost all the way steve and rachel ward have remarkable chemistry and each of their performances are highly impressive if it weren't for the bundles of humour employed one would almost think at times that this actually is a film noir from the 1940s so legitimate and believable is the feel or the atmosphere of the film br br i cannot believe that some people who commented on this film have said that the plot is merely an excuse to hang old movie clips onto and not much use at all and the person who claims that steve martin overacts in this movie mustn't realise that this is regarded as one of steve's more restrained deadpan comedic performances the cleaning woman device turns out to be an important part of the plot and also seems to be a way of using the strangling scene that is taken from the bette davis movie it is also a chance for steve to get in a very tiny element of his wild and crazy guy persona which he substituted with a more suitable for parody straight performance br br a rousing and side-splittingly funny success they don't make em like this anymore
