up to scratch in all areas apart from the editing i'll get to that later this one sees axel head back to beverly hills after a 3-year gap to solve the alphabet crimes the film is more violent than the original and is truer to the simpson/bruckhiemer films that followed br br when you compare this movie to more recent flicks like con air or gone in 60 seconds you can see a definite resemblance in style these movies have very fast editing to heighten the action obviously the editors practised on this movie as the editing is very bad and there are many continuity mistakes br br it doesn't retread the same ground either the first summed up what beverly hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent americans live in when they have more money than they can spend as axel says these rich people loose their minds and want to live in a donut when describing to a building foreman that there are not supposed to be any right angles in the house he is about to steal the music has improved a bit too even if some of it is a direct rip-off of the music in john carpenter's escape from new york it's a shame the music not songs from these films is not available on soundtrack br br give beverly hills cop 2 a chance and don't listen to the narrow-minded critics who panned this film 13 years ago it is also the only one of the 3 that is in 2.35:1
