what a loser this 1998 film is br br it's a shame that signe hasso a great actress so many years ago allowed herself to get into this productive mess i want to remember signe hasso for the house on 92nd street not this mess of a film br br for rob lowe the film is perfect he lacks talent and this picture allows him to display it br br one of the previous comments says that michael york is similar to the late james mason is that true and i congratulate the writer for stating this br br cassie was just too sweet of a girl to be left alone here go know that she led a previous life which is true of the lowe and hasso characters br br ms la rue is no lola that's what was needed for her part as well as far better writing the film appears amateurish at times
