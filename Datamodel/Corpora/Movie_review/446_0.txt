vh1 behind the music catapulted the rock documentary to a different level(good or bad is your opinion however the structure the vh1 producers use works wonders rebellious teens start band plucked from obscurity and poverty by major label rise fall and rise good dramatic arcs br br fearless freaks follows this formula a bit but has different ambitions and mostly i think it succeeds but some sloppy storytelling and an excessive running time hurt the film a bit still there are moments of pure fascination emotion and heartache in this one spoilers 1 3 2 1 the heroin addiction scene with steve mentioned in previous posts becomes a frightening depressing yet fascinating side note even if one views this scene and has never heard the flaming lips you will be moved powerful stuff thanks to both steve and the filmmakers courage to let the audience be moved by this very difficult intimate scene br br however somewhat like most of the lips earlier records the film lacks direction and focus and becomes very vignette like no real connective glue maybe an editing issue br br spoiler 2 3 2 1 example one part of the film mentions how band member steve had some members of this family commit suicide but doesn't come full circle with the story telling they just drop that fragment you don't know who when where why steve's girlfriend mentions it and the filmmakers just drop the whole thing never tie it up disappointing br br example 2 spoilers 3 2 1 the film uses these psychedelic montages as breaking points for the story come on people you could have easily come up with a better transition device i am a video editor by trade so i think i can be critical of this flaw br br when the film doesn't drop the ball and effectively tells the stories of flaming lips members families/relatives/siblings it can compete with any other human interest documentary out there truly moving emotional stuff br br so wrapping it up a good not great film about a soon to be legendary semi cult band and for music freaks like myself the film features interviews of gibby of butthole surfers johnathan donahue from mercury rev meg jack white beck and some others really cool br br end kdc
