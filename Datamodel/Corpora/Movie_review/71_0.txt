overall this film was well acted at least on the part of the main characters br br the major issue i had with the film was the fact that after this guy max admits to raping julietta she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes she forgives him at this point she is pregnant and doesn't know if it is max or jiri's kid but breaks up with jiri for no real reason and has dinner with max as a woman i found this whole part to the story to be completely far-fetched br br i also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than i thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite detailed br br on the whole i didn't enjoy this film the storyline's fault
