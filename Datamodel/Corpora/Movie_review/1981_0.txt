what happens when you don't pay the editor this kind of disjointed storytelling while some of the performances were good the movie suffers from poor plot development and a very confusing timeline a shame because it starts off quite good then slows to a crawl and the interest peters out you spend the last 2/3 of the movie trying to figure out what the heck is going on nice try but no cigar
