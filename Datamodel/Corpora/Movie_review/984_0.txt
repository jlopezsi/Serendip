once i overlooked the slow moving action at times and hokey plot and dialogue i found this movie really entertaining in a circus and carnival freaky pirates treasure monkey violence wild colors in a rough landscape with spaghetti western flashbacks sort of way seemed to really push the envelope for that time period in terms of gay and trans-gender undertones what with the pirate captain's attachment to his butler and to his androgynous second in command the character who paraded around in a dress and feathers and appeared much more interested in will than in arabella i didn't even sense that the pirate captain was attracted to arabella in a sexual way anyway,that made the movie all the more interesting and unique although likely far removed from what jules verne envisioned
