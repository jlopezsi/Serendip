this movie was not what i expected i expected more suspence and alot more acting in order to keep me interested in the film this movie takes place in the early 14th century when the spanish inquisition was at it's peak a bald headed man that plays the part of a priest tries citizens of all kinds of wrongdoing against the bible when he himself is not so innocent he falls in love with a bakers wife and makes sure in his own way that she does not tell anyone of his true identity his associates follow along with with him as they try to gain power and fame themselves using public exicutions and torture this movie is slow and at times boring the actors are no name actors played by people who can't act other than the brief special appearance by oliver reed who for the small role that he played as cardinal he could have done a better job of speaking the fake spanish accent there are better versions of this film watch vincent price's version before you get bored with this one
