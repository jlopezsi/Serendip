a moralistic fairy tale set in modern day brothers black and white are orphans and run the streets of treasure town doing what cats do best stealing and running the yakuza show up and start causing concern leaving little black and sort out the situation it is unbelievable how good this film is nuanced interesting characters are a vehicle for a over arching moral diatribe on cities the people in them and how we all deal with each other white is purity he's naive but has a general sense of good which is married to his seemingly stunted educational and emotional growth his older brother black on the other hand is smart streetwise good in a fight and has lost the innocence that white still possess and we are able to interpret events that occur during the film through both of their eyes this film had very interesting art childish of a sort but designed for the sake of experimentation and to remind us that we're in a story that is seen and narrated by children it used a full palette of colors and symbolism to help extend the story to the viewer and it succeeded masterfully all said this film broke my heart in a million different beautiful ways i loved this film and not since hotaru no haka grave of the fireflies has a film been able to effect me so profoundly i know i will never forget this film when this comes out of dvd rent it or if you're lucky run to the theater and catch this before it disappears
