short film that doesn't waste a moment life is short and hard in this film make one mistake and you're marked for life at least that seems to be sterling hayden's motto gene nelson gives a good performance as a man haunted by his past steve lacey is so scarred by his past that it runs his current life this eventually leads him into trouble andre de toth keeps most of the film in the shadows and only a few scenes take place during the day even the climatic robbery is shot in the dark the only false note is that hayden's character doesn't act the same throughout the movie i found the movie to be pretty brutal for the time and charles bronson did a good job portraying most of the brutality all in all a worthy entry in the film noir genre
