i saw this movie for the first time many years ago i watched it by chance after renting a hollywood box office action film i had two movies that i wanted to rent but the 2nd movie was out so i browsed the movies and picked this one since it had an interesting name peter weller was in it screamers was a last choice rental i'm glad i rented this movie it was a lot better than the box office movies i rented true this movie has a very low budget but thats what makes it great it has the great sorta feel of john carpenter's the thing its a desolete kind of movie the acting in this movie is good especially by peter weller this movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man that use mans weaknesses against man the premise is very intelligent and the amount of action is perfect for the story to unfold this movie will make you think well it made me think this movie is quite entertaining and is one of my all time favorites it could of been improved a little bit but only by the supporting casts acting if this movie had a large or very large budget it would have been made for larger group of the masses and therefore it would have sucked if you like sci-fi this is a must see or addiction for any collection
