i've been hurt by movies before supernova ninth gate meet the feebles pushed me down ten flights of stairs and then savagely kicked me in the groin but all this pales before radioactive dreams where to begin where to vent the hate the concept of this for lack of a better word film is the story of two guys raised in a bomb shelter after being kidnapped by bank robbers fat guy from cool hand luke and other guy not in cool hand luke the kids are raised on detective novels and blah blah blah if you're gonna try and do a take off on film noir try and learn what film noir is don't just watch guys and dolls sniff paint fumes and decide to make a movie br br so these guys run around and arrghhhh pains me to remember this film must struggle on must warn society the story isn't the only thing holding this flick back it's a technical nightmare often times the camera is filming nothing for several minutes apparently while the director lights up another doob and the cast and crew are flogging themselves for their involvement in this wretched wretched film i was actually screaming out loud as this film dragged on like a traffic accident i found i couldn't just turn away as i was in the middle of it with a steering column through my chest author pauses for muted sobbing br br fortunately this movie is not available for sale on either video or dvd however much to my horror i have seen it in several local video stores and i can only assume this atrocity is repeated elsewhere in our fine nation do not watch this movie do not associate with people who recommend this movie for anything other than to induce vomiting it's bad it'll hurt you i know peace br br
