part of the appeal of 3-d is that can lift a relatively boring movie to more than it should be that is the case in jaws 3 having pretty much gotten all they could from the creature from the deep franchise the producers were left with no other choice than to attach a gimmick to this movie to draw an audience br br all i can remember about seeing jaws 3-d in the theaters was that i had a lot fun being young i didn't care much for plot or characters all that mattered was that i was entertained and i was i just saw the movie recently on tape and it was all i could do to stay awake it was just a ripoff of the original and all it's clones if the tape had been in 3-d i might have been more alert br br the only good thing that i can say for the film is that if you can't go to sea world you can at least get an idea of what it is like from this movie
