i am a descendant of john wesley hardin of whom this movie was made my great grandmother was his niece i think this movie was a marvelous tribute because john wesley was an educated cultural person he just didn't have a lot of patience when it came to certain factors like shooting a man for snoring i am honored that the hollywood factor would cast rock hudson as john wesley as john w was a very handsome man according to the tintographs i have of him from my g-grandmother this is an under-rated movie worth watching and the female lead is indeed an actress under-rated she is lovely and supportive a grand western amb
