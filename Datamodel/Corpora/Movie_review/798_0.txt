an episode of very high tension as mulder finds himself in a hostage situation with an alleged abductee very little action but keeps you hooked all the way through and nicely kicks starts the story of scully's abduction due to anderson's real life pregnancy although i would advise people with conditions like epilepsy not to watch this as there are many scenes with flashing and strobe lighting also contains a lot of good alien scenes with good special effects the ending is extremely chilling and will stay with you a good episode one which would make anyone want to continue watching th x-files br br 8/10
