keith cooke plays the last human kickboxer who competes in a tournament where men with cybernetic replacements or are they cyborgs whatever the case my braincells were lost during the transition of course he is forced to fight because his girlfriend tina cote has been abducted and is being forced to train xao gary daniels who is a cyborg also aboard is thom mathews who looks to redeem himself and his father the only good thing i can say about heatseeker is that i didn't have to pay to see it since i caught it on the sci-fi channel unfortunately that is all it has going for it heatseeker also ranks as one of the dullest features from albert pyun his best efforts being the kickboxer series so far what i have seen have been works of mediocrity but heatseeker comes from a curse that no good movie has ever been made by pyun that involves cyborgs robots or machines his best to date was the confusing and sub par nemesis however with heatseeker pyun is desperately out of ideas and imagination so he simply turns this into a robot jox of the fighting circuit also of note is that none of the fight sequences evoke excitement and overall we are left to watch a movie that is hideously dull in it's uninspired tone br br out of 4 bad
