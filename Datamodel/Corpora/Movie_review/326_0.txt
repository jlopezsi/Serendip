i'm watching the dvds of deadwood third season and it seems that somewhere near the middle or the end of season two milch's writing became infected with writing disease you can usually sleep this off but perhaps the production schedule prohibited that br br many people in entertainment forums marvel at milch's writing but it's a question of balance forgive the clich but sometimes less is more the shakespeare bug bit dave apparently and no it's not that he's trying to write like shakespeare wrote but he's trying way too hard to write great and he can't here and there he can yes but not for every character in every other line a little greatness goes a long way br br something gotta give when almost everyone is speaking in their very own stilted high-style the scenes bog down the flow of the story falters and even stops make way for the writing the story even becomes predictable because every scene is merely a vehicle for milch-speech you're walking along trying to groove with the story and you step in a sticky puddle of piddle br br this is not how people apprehend a story through the preciously special use of language people apprehend a story by identifying with its characters perhaps in spite of the writing and milch's writing like mamet's by the way too often shackles the actors and literally tries to steal the scene from them always for the worst the writing having a life of its own eclipses the characters that the actors have busted their guts over to bring to life there ends up being just one character milch br br having said that i notice the stories flow better when people other than milch write plot comes first it seems when others write as it should minus the goofy comic relief half-scenes the stories are compelling and i'm sorta sorry there won't be another season even if i believe deadwood is pretty much tapped out
