this film left me confused the story's not bad in itself reminded me a bit of re-animator but that's not a bad thing at all also the acting was better than i expected for most parts some of the characters behave really really odd though especially the detective guy that is the most irrational cop or character overall i've ever seen in a film and this time it's a bad thing most of the dialogs are pretty annoying too most of the time you only see the face of one character filling the screen saying his line then the next character filling the screen saying his line it's surprising how rarely you actually see the two or more characters taking part in the dialog in one shot that made the dialogs really stale and sometimes painful to watch the overall editing wasn't too bad with some exceptions where a cut left me totally clueless what's going on i also got the feeling that some important things were left out this movie's budget must have been incredibly small the special fx that are used in the ending of the movie would have been a shame in the early 80s now they're not even funny anymore the rest of the effects make-up effects aren't bad so the only scene where the effects are really awful is at the very end of the movie one thing that was bad throughout the movie was the music i mean yeah eerie is one quality music in a horror movie should have sometimes but the music should fit the movie not just be eerie all the time even when the eerie moment is long gone the only exception here to eerie music is no music most sound effects sound out of place too br br this comment probably sounds worse than the movie actually is it's not that bad and if you've got nothing better to do and nothing else to watch you might watch this but if you're not used to low budget films you might have a tough time watching it to the end
