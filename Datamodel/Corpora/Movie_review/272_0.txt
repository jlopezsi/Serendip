i cannot believe how hilarious this movie turned out it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen i can barely contain myself from bursting into laughter at just the thought of it the acting is superb the direction impeccable in fact the entire production is tres magnifique i never had so much fun watching a movie each and every character is endearing and you get the feeling that each actor was born for exactly that role i'm surprised there were no academy award nominations for nathan lane gene hackman robin williams and especially hank azaria that entertainer-extraordinary wannabe the goldman's faithful houseman lol i am laughing as i write this review you must see it to appreciate it 10 of 10 excellent
