i'm sorry but i must respectfully disagree with mr sam h franklin's review of this movie there is in fact one laugh in the entire movie it's the scene where al played by the always great alex rocco is telling the wimpy russel rob reiner how all the merchandise in the store is outdated and he throws the clothes off the mannequins and the last mannequin turns out to be an old lady that was the one funny scene in the movie the old lady ended up partially naked later on in the movie but it wasn't nearly as funny oh and sid caesar did a couple of things which may be construed as humor though that is certainly a subjective construct other than that this is a truly horrid movie i thought it would at least have kitschy value which it almost does but it's not worth it anyway rob reiner should have directed
