the premise of the death of a prominent scientist coinciding with the birth of a child and the two souls merging ten years later was an intriguing one but despite the effective cinematography especially the exterior scenes in new york city there was a central problem to this film br br the major problem was in the characterization of the child the main character anna nicole kidman becomes attached to the 10-year-old boy who claims to be her deceased husband anna then develops an obsession with the child throwing her engagement to joseph danny huston into confusion br br if only the child had some personality and had been able to convey some of the charm of the deceased husband it might have been possible to become engaged in this film as a supernatural thriller when anna and the boy meet privately in central park the site is sean's death scene a more appropriate spot would have been a special part of the park where the couple met in life not the place where sean died throughout the film the boy only asserted ad nauseum that he was the husband sean without giving anna any hint of the soul of her former husband if only the screenwriters could have developed sensitively and insightfully the characterization of the child this film could have been stunning br br the credibility gap was too wide for us to believe that anna would actually begin to love the child as the reincarnation of her husband it was also too difficult to believe that joseph anna's family and the child's parents would permit him to literally move into anna's apartment br br the most effective scene in the film was the moment when anna's sister-in-law clara anne heche confronts the child with her own secrets pertaining to anna and sean the entire film might have resonated this level of energy if only the little boy had been given a personality br br it is unfortunate that this little kid could not have been paired with linda blair's character in the exorcist now that would have been a perfect match
