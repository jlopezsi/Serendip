the dynamic between de niro and crystal is fantastic this film has so many nearly hidden punch lines that it is amazing one of the best is dr sobel's line when he walks into his home and sees the fbi he says obsessive compulsive disorder and they say organized crime division perfect it shows how dr sobel is so outside the entire context of the lifestyle of his patient the most telling line is when he says what is my job here to make you a well-adjusted criminal well done film has more meaning than meets the eye
