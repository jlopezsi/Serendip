this movie is actually pretty watchable if you are a bit technical and don't mind viewing a film to laugh at its inherent badness the script repeatedly uses networking lingo out of context and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of networking principles my favorite scene is when they're searching logs for traces of a computer break-in and the hero exclaims when no traces are found there's not even a cookie i expect even a non-tech should be able to find a couple of laughs about the overwhelming lack of technical advisement some understanding of distributed attacks and viruses might have helped but i guess the idea of two hackers trying to out type each other works better for hollywood the cinematography is low-average for a made for tv i liked judge reinhold's acting and kris kristofferson bakula i found to be often flat or alternately overacted conclusion don't rent it unless you're into bad movies worth catching on cable on a slow day
