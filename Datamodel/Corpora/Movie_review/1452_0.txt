i rented just write for valentine's day largely due to the reviews i read on this site my adoration of sherilyn fenn had a little impact also most people thought it was a great date movie br br you know the basis of the story if you've read the summary so i won't repeat it here jeremy piven from tv's short-lived cupid plays the bus driver whose favorite actress is amanda clark wonderfully played by fenn he brings the same appeal he did to cupid funny and down-to-earth he really makes you pull for his character br br sherilyn fenn has one of the best roles of her career even though it may not be much of a stretch an actress playing an actress she looks absolutely wonderful and while i don't know what sherilyn's like personally gives amanda such warmth and sincerity that it's hard not to fall in love with someone like her br br the two of them have a really nice chemistry together i wanted to see more of them as a couple there were some nice supporting characters who added a lot to the story there was the typical misunderstanding but it was resolved in a nice way some reviews have stated that it was unrealistic for a famous movie star to fall for a guy like this but i don't view that as a negative first all good romantic comedies have similar problems pretty woman notting hill sleepless in seattle how realistic are they they all resolve them in an interesting way just like this movie does second i enjoy putting myself in a movie how would i react in this situation and this one allowed me to pretend that i was pursuing amanda/sherilyn that's what movies are for br br in summary guys don't view this as a chick flick just because it involves a love story it's every bit as good as those i mentioned above rent this movie with someone you love and enjoy the ride i actually watched it again the next day and even fast-forwarded through it a third time to watch just the scenes between piven and fenn it's special my score 10
