o.c and stiggs the altman flick that should have been a cult classic but never was based on a series of short stories appearing in national lampoon the movie is slow at some points the dance scene for example but it is easily made up for by the absurdly hysterical parts br br ex br br o.c are you guys veterans sponson does ho chi minh eat rice krispies ha ha ha ha br br hands up br br take your time and think remember that kid who everybody picked on relentlessly back in high school maybe you were that kid even so everyone can appreciate jon cryer's role as the little spaz we all loved to hate back then and loved to torture if you haven't seen it yet and you like altman's other movies this is a definite must-see
