the original beverley hills cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made this quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel made three years later and although part two like many sequels never quite manages that same verve as the original film it still offers a good time and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment and who didn't will probably have a good time with this sequel too all the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again with eddie murphy heading a capable ensemble cast lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences the plot is as you would expect superfluous to the style of the film and much of the movie is simply tailored around it but anyway it follows maverick copper axel foley and his two california police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the alphabet murders which involves a robbery a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner br br i've got to say that eddie murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film while they were still over the top they were at least sort of believable here however murphy goes massively over the top and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw anyway murphy obviously enjoys himself and if you can get by the complete lack of logic you probably will too true to style the action is completely over the top too with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is the film lacks any kind of themes or substance meaning that it will both not please serious film fans and that this reviewer is running out of steam but i will say that this movie does have a point to make and that is simply entertaining it's audience it may be completely silly illogical fun but some movies need to be there just to entertain and this is one of those i wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists or going into with huge expectations but it's a good time that's for sure
