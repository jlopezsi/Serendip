this is the ninth falcon film and a particularly good one it contains some very good second unit material shot in mexico so there must have been a large budget for that as it must have taken at least two or three weeks on location it took a lot of editing to intercut all that with the actors back home in the studio tom conway is in fine form and there is some crackling dialogue as usual are you following me around i've been doing nothing else since we first met no prizes for figuring out who said that there are excellent performances from two hispanic actors fernando alvarado is a charming little mexican boy and nestor paiva is excellent in a major supporting role martha vickers is suitably alluring and ambiguous as a typical falcon heroine one would like to have some time alone with her in her dressing room just for research purposes of course the plot is solid a truly puzzling mystery this time with so many possible villains that the fingers on both hands seem hardly sufficient this is an excellent unpretentious b picture just the sort of thing one wants in the falcon series
