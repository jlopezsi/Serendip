the final fantasy series was never one of my favorite things to play but when final fantasy vii hit the playstation i was addicted but a few years later when final fantasy viii came to american shores and i piked it up i was blown away it was just awesome the graphics to the storyline even the music the game was everything i wanted in an rpg a must own for fans of genre even though most people wanted the ff series to go back to their roots taking out the modern edge i personally enjoyed the fact that it was somewhat modern it's easier to relate with
