i pretty much agree with glazedham's review i will add the following one of the things that i found most annoying is the fact that arquette is frequently seen holding a camera while another camera is filming her holding the camera i don't know why but this was unbelievably aggravating to me all in all i was left with the impression that many of these artists have just taken way too many drugs if their lives are so difficult i recommend that they get off the stage and go to a part of the world where they can witness real suffering hopefully they will take arquette and her hand-held camera with them maybe she will eventually use footage from the hand-held camera as it seems to have served absolutely no purpose in this film
