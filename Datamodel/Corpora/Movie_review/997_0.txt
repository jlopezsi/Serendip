i saw this in pittsburgh pa in a small theater there this movie was a lot of fun with tons of b movie stars and references a total blast from start to finish with everything you'd expect from a low budget movie brinke stevens robert z'dar edwin neal and tom savini are especially good this is by far the most fun i've had at the movies in years
