a lot of people criticize this movie as just being too dumb but i'm just saying give this movie a chance it may not be the best film ever made but at least it has clever gags in it and also includes a very young john candy i saw clips of the movie on the internet and i was amazed on how they were funny especially the scene when candy unintentionally almost destroys the entire police station while trying to find a pencil or when he hilariously fails his shooting test in the gun range since this movie was barely released in the u.s you may want to track down a copy of it before it disappears completely also look for peter cook mickey rooney and dick emery in what was to be his last film role in the cast as well
