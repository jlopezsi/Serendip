i rented this with such skepticism and you know i thought it would be so cool really violent and terrifying it would be disgustingly gory at times and just somewhat above the bar horror yarn what i got was something so totally different br br the movie starts with this woman in her home her husband goes out somewhere telling her he'll be back pretty soon he's a goner and his killer takes a nixon mask the guy used to scare his wife and puts it on then the wacko goes into the house to get the wife the scene moves so damn slow even though it is supposed to be scary there is like no sound the wife reacts to everything like five or ten seconds after it happens and there's this really gross scene where she falls on this glass table and her whole wrist is shredded up and off and there's like two drops of blood then the scene continues and we all knows what happens next br br the movie moves on and we find out about this wacko father and his two sons then enter these three college students getting to know about highway five one of the girls i can't remember why meets the two brothers who eventually invite her back to their apartment it's all so very surreal eventually that night they kidnap her and take her to their house up on highway five br br the two others a freaky pothead guy and some hippie-esque girl head up to this abandoned lot on highway five in their van to do something research i suppose i have faint memory cut to many scenes with the other girl then nighttime this movie is so weird and i won't tell you everything but soon the killers start killing everybody off until this long and quite weird chase scene with the hippie and nixon then an ending that i have to admit left me on the edge of my seat until the very unique and very cool ending br br i totally suggest checking this movie out it has cult potential i could watch this many times it is so weird if you find this please see it at first you will hate it then you will like it for how cheesy it is if anything you have never seen anything like this before br br
