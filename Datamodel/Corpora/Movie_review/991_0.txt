this is an entertaining and interesting film as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does br br our depiction of small town middle american life circa 1944 is wildly inaccurate and glorified but this is not at all unusual in films of the era world war ii era audiences would have considered themselves morally superior to the germans and had no argument with life as seen in tomorrow the world in reality however it is unlikely that a jewish woman would have been a teacher in a largely protestant public school and even less likely that she would have entered into an interfaith marriage with the only protest being raised by a small foreign boy and if one considers how the story would have played out had the character of leona been black she not only would have never been teaching in a white public school but had she and mike frame sought to be married there likely would have been a response from the community that involved a lynching and thus our moral superiority over the germans is exposed as being more imagined than real br br none of which particularly ruins the film it requires no greater suspended-disbelief than superman or dracula and on its own merits this film is an enjoyable experience however sanitized small town 1940's america is a place one almost cannot help but to long for and into this idealized world enters emil a character that at first comes on ludicrously overplayed and yet pulls you in just the same the audience quickly becomes concerned for what will happened to the frame family and the guilty pleasure of watching this pre bad seed demon will keep you on the edge of your seat after what emil does to pat the vigilante justice meted out by pat's school-mates is shamelessly gratifying to see throughout the story one keeps secretly hoping for emil's redemption and it is the film's greatest drawback that it attempts to grant this wish in a quick and unrealistic throwaway end this inadequately explored issue as well as the intriguing and thoroughly under-utilized subplot of emil's manipulation of jessie leave the distinct impression that someone demanded a great deal of running time be shaved off of this film br br tomorrow the world still gets major points for at least attempting a subject matter few films of its era outside of propaganda newsreels would dare touch and it's worth a watch
