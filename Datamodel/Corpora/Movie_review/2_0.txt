william boyd and louis wolheim are the two arabian knights referred to in the title humorously the pair start out as u.s pows trying to escape from the germans during world war i eventually they find themselves on board a ship bound for arabia while tripping out to the middle east they rescue an arab woman mary astor who turns out to be a princess and of course becomes a romantic interest for the two arabian knights no points for guessing who wins the veiled ms astor br br the film is very well photographed and directed lewis milestone has wonderful sets and stages scenes beautifully of the performances mr wolheim stands out he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak trough the film is silent the story isn't as strong as it could be there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters locale changed the last looks exchanged between one of the stars and an extra is an example of something i didn't understand perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time br br the film is damaged in several places but there is enough preserved in even these scenes to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks boris karloff appears as the purser watch for his big scene on ship when wolheim goes into a room with him for some money what actually happens is a mystery early in the film there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up or thereabouts they are pows being herded to the showers director milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect this shower scene is different in that several of the men don't look as caucasian as you might expect maybe not as many caucasian men would agree to appear nude br br two arabian knights 9/23/27 lewis milestone william boyd louis wolheim mary astor
