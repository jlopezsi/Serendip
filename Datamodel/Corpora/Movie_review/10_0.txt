finally i got to see this legendary masterpiece on tv when i first heard that there was an arabian movie featuring the western icon hopalong cassidy william boyd and the gothic icon boris karloff the idea sounded like a disparate joke actually karloff only plays a brief minor role being new to the silver screen at that time br br the script is very original the shooting is excellent for the times and the acting is so well done you feel what the characters feel and can easily read the actors lips for practically every line unlike many silent-era films you get the sensation that you are in this one br br the comedy starts right from the opening scene and i will describe it only to illustrate the unexpected silliness of william boyd he is in a night battle in world war i and drops into a shell crater to avoid german gunfire his 1st sergeant a bully and a brute whom he despises had just fallen in before him and is unconscious boyd tries to revive him until he sees who he is and starts slinging mud on the sergeant's face he revives and they immediately jump into a fistfight in the mud when a flare illuminates the night sky they look up and see the hole is surrounded with numerous germans with bayonets the enemy was having a time watching them fight each other it is an eye opener to see the future hopalong cassidy in a real cut-up comedy role back when he looked like a very young cross between marlon brando and jack haley br br i was very impressed with the nitty-gritty reality in this film about pow's of world war i in an era when glossed-over heroics and reality-denial dominated war films moreover there is often a timeless feeling especially during the pow camp scenes which gives the viewer a sense of closeness to the people of that era and the understanding that people have at all times in history been in their own way modern br br the dual-based plot survival and escape and later a pursuit of romance rolls steadily through ever-changing backgrounds the factors of comedy action danger and romance blend harmoniously throughout the relationship between boyd's and wolheim's characters develop from utter hatred to enduring animosity to forced survival cooperation to mild mutual suspiciousness to amorous competition to strong friendship br br though this is a silent film from 1927 centered on world war i in europe and turkey i have never had such a modern and timeless feeling from a silent movie this results from the cool timeless acting and characterizations and the excellent directing and shooting br br this is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed until now only preferring silent comedic standards by keaton chaplin and harold lloyd
