ok sorry i couldn't resist though this is a pretty grim movie at times i can't hear the phrase spanish inquisition without going through the monty python routine once the movie starts however i am always so engrossed i forget about the sketch br br this movie had me hooked from the first scene the first time i saw it but it has that rare quality of actually getting better with every viewing as many have said this is without a doubt full moon's all-time best i'm a diehard stuart gordon fan and if it wasn't for re-animator i might say it was gordon's best too by the way the first scene is very grisly and cold-blooded and you know it's gonna be a great movie when that happens even before the opening credits br br i'm really saddened that this movie didn't get more of a chance for wide release i remember it being in the theater for maybe one week and then going to video and the only reason i even knew it existed was from reading fangoria look at the cast while they aren't all considered a-list they are favs among horror and cult fans lance henriksen millennium aliens tom towles henry portrait of a serial killer jeffrey combs re-animator from beyond frances bay blue velvet oliver reed i think the other strike it has against it is that people see the title maybe that's why it was changed in some versions including the r-rated dvd that i rented to the inquisitor and figure it's a travesty to even try to remake some friends wouldn't even give the movie a chance to the point where they didn't even want to look at the box they were so scornful until i had to beg them to watch it they thanked me after the first few scenes br br don't get me wrong the original is wonderful and vincent price is well vincent price and in a class by himself however this movie has very little in common with corman's other than the title the fact that both movies are based on poe's work and that there's a scene towards the end where some unlucky b*stard tries to get free before the pendulum slices him in half the similarities end there however and i don't think it's fair or accurate to call it a remake br br this version is actually set back in spain during 1492 the real inquisition lance henriksen who can make his voice sound so quietly evil that hopkins as hannibal lecter sounds harmless by comparison stars as torquemada with the assistance of his underlings he wants to rid the world of witchcraft and heresy figuring the best way to do this is to torture and kill what seems like 99 of the population historically he was said to be responsible of over 100,000 executions during one ugly public display involving gordon's wife carolyn purdy-gordon other than re-animator she always seems to come to a horrible end in his movies the young baker antonio and his lovely wife maria make the mistake of trying to intervene so they assume she's a witch and toss her in the dungeon in her cell she's befriended by kindly esmeralda in one of the most clever twists her cellmate turns out to be the one out of the tens of thousands accused who actually is a witch maria's husband tries to save her and of course is immediately arrested as well unfortunately for maria ole torq is horrified to find himself secretly attracted to her he's a monk and as henriksen explains in the feauturette has probably never gotten any in his life and doesn't know how to deal with it at first it seems like maria might be able to use this to her advantage but since torq is so psychotically religious that he thinks any human emotions are the work of satan things just get more complicated and intense from there br br there are several references other than the pendulum to poe's work clever ones that fit in with the plot and are not just tossed in for the hell of it someone is walled up even quoting the notorious line for the love of god yes for the love of god is the grim reply a cask of wine is revealed to be amontillado there's also subtle references to the premature burial and probably more i missed br br one of the elements that is actually kind of amusing in a horrible way is that you have absolutely no chance against the evil forces in this movie to the point where it is ludicrous you're reasonably attractive you're obviously trying to tempt men and must be a witch you're ugly that's also a sign of being a witch you look normal you're a witch disguised as a normal person you try to fight back when they tear your clothes off to examine you you're not co-operating you're a witch you give up and co-operate you're an evil whore you have a mole or freckle anywhere on your body that's the mark of the devil and you're a witch oh you don't have any someone will pinch you and make a mark oh the mark is starting to fade you're using your evil powers to make it fade you're just completely screwed no matter what also if they haven't tortured you yet and you confess first to get it over with sorry no such luck you might just be trying to avoid torture so confession doesn't officially count until you've been tortured for days-that is if you don't die under torture not another one a torturer complains in exasperation at one point br br the cast is amazing there's not even near enough room to list all the great acting in this movie standouts are henriksen who not only portrays total evil all too convincingly but the inner struggle against his lust for maria vs his holy duty oliver reed has less than 10 minutes of screen time as a heavy-drinking cardinal who comes to visit torquemada and try to get him to ease up on the mass killing a little but trust me you'll remember his scene long after the movie is over jeffrey combs as the scribe with the prince valiant haircut and huge horn-rimmed harry potter glasses who seems to be the only one involved who is just doing his job and not getting off on it like all of torquemada's other flunkies steals every scene he's in a less talented actor would have been forgettable in what could have been a boring part but he makes the most of every second of his screen time he also gets the some of the best and funniest lines how can they confess if they don't have tongues including the best in the movie along with the actress playing esmeralda she's wonderful and one of the best and most memorable scenes of this or any horror movie for that matter involves her show-stopping revenge when she's burned at the stake as she's being dragged up comb's character actually tells her apologetically i'm sorry that you weren't properly able to confess there just wasn't enough time to torture you esmeralda thanks anyway br br not only am i running out of room to rave about how much i loved this movie but i don't want to talk it up so much that i ruin it just watch enjoy and get the bejeezus scared out of you make sure you are not going to be interrupted for 90 minutes because it is so riveting you do not want to have to turn it off even for a minute watch and prepare to be impressed caution this is not a movie for kids or easily upset adults the movie pulls no punches in the graphic portrayal of extremely nasty tortures and executions the movie is scary and disturbing enough i try not to dwell to long on the fact that it is based on historical events in the words of a character during a climactic moment that you won't forget for a long time welcome to hell
