this is possibly the funniest mob movie that i have seen billy crystal is perfectly cast as is robert de niro(he makes a very convincing mobster the entire cast of mafia thugs is perfectly cast lisa kudrow is convincing as crystal's enduring fiancee i haven't laughed this hard or often in a very long time this movie was even better the second and third time around the dialogue is the key to the chemistry in this movie a favorite scene of mine involves de niro's character venting his feelings on a pillow the culminating moment came in the end it was a very satisfying conclusion that left me in the high spirits that the movie created here's to another de niro/crystal pairing in the future this is definitely a film worth seeing
