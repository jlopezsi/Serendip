it is a rare event when i rate a movie on the level of a 10 but if i could i would go even higher for this film i grew up with many films like this cartoon fantasies including bfg the brave frog the hobbit and even wizards but none quite effected me on the level of this brilliant movie while when i was young i did not capture the fantastic beauty of such a sweet story i did feel something that nothing else gave me something perfect i only wish i could find it and sadly i cannot br br the story is as many say somewhat themed after shakespeare's classic romeo juliet however the mixture of vibrant fantasy and animation makes this far more memorable and i am a lover of r&j this is in my truest of hearts the movie to me there is no better movie and there is no film that means more br br i would recommend this to anyone with a child in their heart and passion in their soul it is a wonderful piece of cinematic genius and i know that if i could only find it i could reclaim a piece of my wondrous childhood br br if you ever find this obtain it and hold onto it you do not know what a beautiful gem you possess
