this one works on several levels that may not all be apparent to the casual viewer it delves into the sci-fi area of the fear and apprehension of the new and strange unfamiliar technologies that did do and always will cause mankind to shudder to think of just what our role will be in the future this parallels the then current political idea of a society that would be best ruled by scientists engineers and the like known as technocracy this system neither had much room nor any sympathy for the human side of things too inefficient br br secondly the inclusion of the satanist cult is both a throw back to old gothic type horror tales of witches ghosts and the supernatural this is a link to the vampire and werewolf and is a horror that cannot be more universal not universal fear of the occult br br thirdly the element of the story that is perhaps the most pertinent to our modern world the mansion,which serves as the setting for most of the film is built on the sight of a great world war i battle in which countless thousands lost their lives this in the end is probably the most horrifying and truthful element when combined with the blood-letting and cruelties of man to fellow man that are portrayed as the climax to the film the movie sounds both a condemnation of what has transpired in the previous part of the 20th century wwi and the unthinkable atrocities that were to come
