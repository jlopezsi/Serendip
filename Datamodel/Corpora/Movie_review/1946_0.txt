i have to say you know it has been my sequel weekend despite repeated warnings from my family and imdb users to skip this jaws flick if you even want to really call it that but i ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic jaws in the words of nancy karogan oh why why that was the only way i could describe the film and sitting throw it br br wither it was the cheesy cheesy cheesy effects i mean did every horror movie in the 80's have to be 3-d it's rather well cheesy the plot was there a plot i even ask there was no main story or line for us to follow and i felt the story kept on forgetting to telling us the sub-plot the acting was horrible i'm surprised dennis could even get a career after this i'm just telling you please do not be as stupid as me and ignore the warnings be afraid be very afraid of the actual movie that is br br 1/10
