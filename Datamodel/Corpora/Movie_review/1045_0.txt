i am surprised that so much of the negative response to the movie revolves around paul's antics if you watch the movie with your eyes open you can see that everybody is laughing through most of paul's more volatile moments if you are one of the people who is down on the movie because i wouldn't let him do that to clearly they don't belong there the truth is that paul knows who can and can't take it and adjusts accordingly br br the other criticism is generally does cj really get anything from the school i am one of cj's biggest fans lets get that out of the way right now but without the school that allows him to play with equally talented people he may be just like so many of the best guitar players that i have known the best guitar player in town in a local garage band with a revolving door membership that may get to play to the local drunks on wednesday night for beer through his association with paul he has been to zappanale completed a west coast tour been featured on mtv and played in more places than i can count they do very well for each other br br i will say that the movie was more than i expected going in but i would have liked to see more of the sabbath show
