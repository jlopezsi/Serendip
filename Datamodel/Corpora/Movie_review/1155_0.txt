as many of the other reviewers have stated this movie presents to us a character with dreams of creating a good life for himself who ends up falling into the prison system q-tip and darnell martin do a great job in developing a script that embodies a trueness to the characters which i am sure that the cast helped expand on the silent moments of the film present the best moments especially the last minutes where his works are displayed br br the movie takes ideas from many other prison films however i have never seen a film present anything about asbestos and prisoners having to work in these conditions after watching the dvd i only wish that commentary were added and interviews at least with the director and writers worth a watch or two 8/10
