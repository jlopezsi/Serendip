at first through the first third of the movie i was sure that the film was an allegory about the architect's family and friends never actually noticing him or his moustache things got confusing to me when he didn't press his wife about the bali photographs which appear to confirm he's not crazy his wife is apparently trying to have him committed and he suddenly escapes to hong kong br br though i did enjoy the film immensely in all its detail i kept feeling there must have been a link between his moustache and the identity crisis shaving it off led to and his father's death his father's death seemed to have discombobulated him br br did his own confusion about his moustache symbolize his inability to digest the death of his father was he dreaming all of the confusion about his moustache br br in the end i'm left with questions only nonetheless i did enjoy this film and would like to know what other people think of it and what they make of it
