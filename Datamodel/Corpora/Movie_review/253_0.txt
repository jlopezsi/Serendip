the only film which i'd consider unintentional horror is this it because i may explain the plot is about lies and deception it's all in the family when a man must convince his future in-laws that he's as uptight as they are armand and albert have built the perfect life for themselves tending to their gaudy miami nightclub but their pastel tranquility is shaken when armand's son announces that he's getting married to the daughter of ultra-conservative senator keeley and they're all getting together for dinner can armand and albert transfer transform themselves into mr and mrs family values in time it'll take the performance of their lives but they'll do anything and everything to pull the chiffon over keeley's eyes now the alien movies didn't scare me the strangers didn't scare me trick r treat didn't scare me final destination 3 and 4 didn't scare me but the drag scenes made me squirm in my seat<br br rating 1/10
