i rate it a 10 by how it affected me when i first saw it on television years ago probably 78 or 79 i've only seen it once yet i still remember it and thanks to imdb i finally found the info on it it might be horrible if i viewed it now some things don't hold up well through the years that being said all i can remember is laying on the floor watching the television and beating the carpet i was laughing so hard and my best friend called screaming through the phone wheezing like he was going to die he was watching it also we didn't throw up but we definitely couldn't breathe it was that good at the time i hope it comes out someday on dvd so i can give it the test until then i still fondly give it a 10 and leonard maltin is not right a lot of the time don't let him sway you
