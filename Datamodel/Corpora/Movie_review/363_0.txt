my children and i truly enjoyed this delightful movie even though the story line is a little predictable the actors made it fun to watch this is a kid movie they loved the slapstick and the predictability the scene with joey on the porch talking to his dad was my favorite it brought tears to my eyes that boy was very natural and sincere my children and i thought it was cute,and a lot of fun for family entertainment
