julius caeser was an enigmatic character historically as well as in shakespeare's portrayal of him reading his works in latin is both a delight and wonder the propaganda of the gallic wars lays the foundation for wartime journalism portraying the enemy as something slightly less than human and the cause of the invaders as something noble and enlightened having said this one looks at the bard's depiction of caeser's assassination and his portrayal of caeser as something different from history br br sir john gielgud was always stately in whatever role he played he was an excellent cassius in the 1955 version but seems a bit distanced in his role as the dictator one reviewer accuses him of being a ham and overacting well thanks for sharing that unshared opinion heston plays moses playing marc anthony and jason robards grumbles his lines as brutus the real role that justifies the price of admission is that of the brit richard johnson whose angry sullen cassius stands out against robards's wooden brutus christopher lee and robert vaughn both execute their roles splendidly as do the ladies jill bennett and the ever lovely diana rigg the pretty boy role of octavius by richard chamberlain was merely ok and clumsy and the fight scenes seem a bit cranky compared to what we see today but we're in it for shakespeare not a shoot'em or garish cast of thousands recreating bloody battle scenes br br i prefer the 1955 version with the ham of hams brando as mark antony and louis calhern as caesar there the great gielgud and a competent james mason made the respective roles of the conspirators cassius and brutus sparkle
