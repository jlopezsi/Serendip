this is an excellent movie br br it's a billy crystal movie so i knew i would like it but this was wonderful i would recommend to anyone 17 or over br br it was one of those movies that you just don't want to end br br i'm sorry to those of you who didn't like it because of the language but it is rated r and it has robert de niro what do you expect i've never seen a de niro film that didn't have f in it br br anyway billy crystal is the funniest man alive and de niro was perfect for the part br br
