this may very well be the worst movie ever made with the possible exception of man's best friend the story is idiotic the acting is unbelievably bad and the special effects look like a 7 year-old made them on a pc for example at one point the shark which looks like a cardboard cut-out and probably is smashes the plate glass to the viewing area as sea world and then as the water rushes through the broken panel the shark just sits there all in all a hilarious movie i wouldn't have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age what amazes me is why dennis quaid consented to be in this travesty since he is not that bad of an actor but i guess to be consistent with the rest of the film he acted horribly himself what were they thinking when they made this movie that is the mystery
