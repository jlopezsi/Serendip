this is a cheap and tatty generic sci-fi military paranoia paste-up job using clich√©s minted in a thousand other movies br br it does the best it can on a budget of about ninepence but that isn't very good the special effects aren't very special lots of ordnance expended and the chameleon effect is interesting and the alien is poorly executed br br the cast with the exception of robert culp adding a few bucks to the pension fund is composed of total unknowns and this movie is not going to change that for any of them br br and there is incessant use of the f word to no particular effect it isn't big and it isn't clever guys
