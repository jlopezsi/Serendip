abysmal shockingly awful bottom of the barrel things can't get any worse than this stink-bomb i still suffer severe depression when i think about this abomination 3d they announced well it didn't work the only teeth coming at me in the cinema were the ones that a boy in the third row had stolen from his grandfather and thrown the fish's head floating pointlessly at the start reminded me to buy some haddock on the way home from the cinema the acting was so wooden that a carpenter in the audience got his tools out i could feel the audience slipping away into some mass coma it was heartbreaking i remember my friend glancing at me his eyes lifeless and sad special jaws 3 counselling groups were set up in my local area and i attended regularly.this crime against cinema should be battered and fried absolutely disgraceful
