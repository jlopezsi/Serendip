take some college students put them in a van throw in a killer in a richard nixon mask and bang you've got an instant classic the plot includes nazis,rape,mysterious rooms and that's about it but this is what makes the film great it's total ineptness at everything from creating suspense to scaring the viewer and the glue that holds the whole film together is the most whacked out ludicrously insane soundtrack in movie history if you don't want to watch the movie(which i could understand but you'll miss out on some wonderful chase scenes involving president nixon)just put the movie in your vcr close your eyes and listen to the jarring sounds of horror house on highway five also make sure not to miss one of the least satisfying and sensible endings in movie history
