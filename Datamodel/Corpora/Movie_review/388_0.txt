this is the only sequel i have seen that could be considered an improvement on its original br br i'm a great fan of ginger snaps and was really excited about this film when i first heard about it unfortunately when it arrived at the cinema i was to young to see it i'm sure its always a gamble for people and film fans alike to buy movies on tapoe/dvd with out viewing them first and for me this was a first it was well worth the risk of my cash as i loved the film the casting was especially good this time around the dvd showing the auditions in all their glory as far as the films go emily perkins takes her original part and runs with it totally convincing the audience that she is trying to break away from her sister and the ghosts of the past br br the special effects and make up are of course grander this time around which enhances the horror side of things but i my self view this more as a drama that a horror film the suspense is really edgy and makes you want to fast forward to the next scene to see what happens next as well as the stand allow story of briditte's new company ghost making you want more as the plot continues even as a sequel this is a hard one to beat i whole heartedly will you to see it even if you have not yet view the first one
