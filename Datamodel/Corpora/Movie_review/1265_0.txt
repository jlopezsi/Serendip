a unique view for a holocast movie and a good introduction for children many who probably have read the book at school they probably will not mind watching it if kirsten dunst and brittney murphy are in it good location work excellent acting and no glossing over what happened in the camps a bit scary for the younger set but a good introduction to films of a more mature theme such as schindlers list et al
