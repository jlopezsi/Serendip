fearless freaks is an excellent documentary that's sure to please longtime fans like myself as well as newer fans and will probably win them a fair batch of new followers as watch me jumpstart does with robert pollard of guided by voices it paints an intimate portrait of head lip wayne coyne as a family man and member of his community we get plenty of interesting background into coyne's early family life and nascent artistic aspirations interviews with band members family members and friends are inter-cut with raw live footage of the group's often very visually fascinating performances the pace is just right to keep the viewer always entertained and never bored but not at a breakneck highly edited mtv-ish pace my only complaint about the movie is that details on the band's history and specific works by them are rather skimpy i would have liked to have gotten more details such as wayne explaining his inspirations for various songs discussions about their creative process studio stories and the like br br drummer steven drozd becomes the other major character in this movie when his addiction to heroin is frankly and almost shockingly discussed and portrayed on film without giving too much away this subplot comes to an apparently happy ending and the movie concludes on a high note with the flaming lips on stage playing before their enthralled fans on the verge of another artistic triumph here's to the flaming lips
