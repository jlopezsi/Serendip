this isn't the worst comedy of all-time but that is about the best thing that i can say about this pathetic film i didn't laugh once or even smile once during this bomb there was usually something going on on-screen so i didn't get too bored but most of the jokes here were simply awful the final sequence is nothing more than a long series of people falling through doors and stumbling all over the place needless to say it was a fitting way to end a movie that was impossible for me to like
