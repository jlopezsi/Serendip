im a big fan of the western genre and so bias but that said deadwood is the greatest thing since moving pictures were invented over the top perhaps but after a seeing a review on charlie brookers screenwipe i immediately bought the dvds and instantly became addicted my only problem i have with this program is that it caused me and my friends to neglect our uni exams it is without doubt the most realistic portrayal of the west and sometimes this can be annoying for instance when wild bill hickock is shot dead i was furious at how easily it was done but that would be how it was sometimes i wish calamity jane was more tough as she always appears all talk to me but this further adds to the complexity of each character no matter how minor the most moving moments to me are a toss up between the confrontation between dan dority and doc cochran over sofia metz or one single moment when swearengen watches reverand smith mad ranting from the balcony with a tear in his eye these moments for me show the versatility and complexity of deadwood and its characters br br watch it from the start
