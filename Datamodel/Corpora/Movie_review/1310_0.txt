this film is amazing i can't put it in any words better than that if you're an anime fan that enjoys a lot of variety you need to see this film no questions asked the animation to this movie is bizarre but yet very vivid at the same time to the point of where you're saying exactly what i said in my summary wow the storyline is where it continues to get better it seems like it's an average tale of two brothers who are heroes to a town and do great things but it turns out that there's so much more the heroes are both good and bad just as their names describe black and white and the villains are as bad as they come the only issue is that some of the storyline leaves a couple holes at the end making you wonder what happened but yet giving you an idea in your head of what you think might've happened nevertheless although tekkonkinkreet is rated r and very violent it's still a great movie that i truly believe any anime fan will come to love
