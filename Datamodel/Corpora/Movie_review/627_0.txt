boy there must have been a real dearth/scarcity of film fests back then not that being nom'd for the palme d or is chicken feed but no others very odd br br re whomever's comment about clu being demented he didn't seem that way to me although i guess he had somewhat of a rep as an actor numerous actors who really care about their craft and/or are simply real people do have such days or weeks or years so his interview on the dvd of the killers is very lucid although it may have been rehearsed no idea br br but this is a really terrific short film it's worth renting geogre washington just to watch it imo
