when i say this is my favourite film of all time that comment is not to be taken lightly i probably watch far too many films than is healthy for me and have loved quite a few of them i first saw la femme nikita nearly ten years ago and it still manages to be my absolute favourite why br br this is more than an incredibly stylish and sexy thriller luc besson's great flair for impeccable direction fashion and appropriate usage of music makes this a very watchable film but it is anne parillaud's perfect rendering of a complex character who transforms from a heartless killer into a compassionate vibrant young woman that makes this film beautiful i can't keep my eyes off of her when she is on screen br br i have seen several of luc besson's films including subway the professional and the irritating fifth element and nikita is without a doubt far superior to any of these although this film has tragic elements it is ultimately extremely hopeful it is the story of a person who is cruel and merciless who ultimately comes to realize her own humanity and her own personal power that to me is extremely inspiring if there is hope for nikita there is hope for all of us
