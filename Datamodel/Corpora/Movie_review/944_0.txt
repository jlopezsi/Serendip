call me hopelessly sentimental but i actually find this film very touching once you totally suspend your disbelief this is a film it's kind of expected jez and dylan really sell the orphans concept here you have two lonely needy love-starved guys who through hard work self-denial and sheer determination win themselves a family and a home how can your heart not melt the acting by the male leads is strong enough mostly the why do i have to get so technical scene falters a bit to make you invest emotionally in dylan and jez quest despite the fact that all soft-heartedness aside they are two lying selfish close to morally bankrupt con-merchants by the end of the film you'll be cheering them on br br what am i saying by five minutes in you'll be cheering them on yes it's full of clich√©s yes it's pretty predictable yes it's soppy but this film proves that you can get away with anything if you have lovable characters and a fantastic soundtrack see also ocean's 11 never fails to cheer me up i'd recommend it to anyone not entirely hard-boiled
