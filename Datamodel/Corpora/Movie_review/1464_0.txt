i have to say as a huge horror buff this was absolute gutter trash i kept asking myself where is the gore the blood the fear/horror factor br br the main music reminded me of rave techno music and i felt i needed to be in a club with glowing objects in my mouth br br i will say some of the actors were good like the guy off melrose place thomas calabro and the gal from hellraiser ashley laurence but overall i would not go out of my way to recommend to someone to see this unless they were looking for something silly and cheesy to watch or they really didn't like horror because they scared easily this would be a recommendation to see as there is nothing scary nothing gory or horrific about it
