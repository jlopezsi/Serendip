i love the columbo series have seen at least 80 percent of the show's episodes and hope to eventually see them all so far this one is by far the worst what makes it so disappointing is that it has a wonderful supporting cast john dehner diane baker robert vaughn wilfrid hyde-white and dennis dugan among others but what a waste of talent and what terrible pacing and staging patrick mcgoohan is a fine actor and his performances as the murderer in this series are outstanding but his directing in this episode is simply awful if you're a columbo fan skip this one if you're not a columbo fan all the more reason to skip it as well
