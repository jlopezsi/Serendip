this entry begins with another wedding about to take place one of the gifts is a huge diamond brought by algy and created by his father in law it turns out that he has a process for making diamonds for as cheap as a shilling each this of course would upset the balance of trade and the diamond industry would be destroyed he still wants credit for his findings but it brings a whole host of bad people into the mix the best scene is tenny riding a motorcycle and crawling onto a moving car he of course is the best character in all of the movies i've seen and once again is called on to fix things there are murders there are notes destroyed the whole state of the world's economy is never really taken care of ours is not to worry about such things i guess there are several cases of mistaken identity which makes this a lot of fun
