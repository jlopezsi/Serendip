the original xtro 1983 still remains a cult favorite these days because of the gory effects and weird nightmare sequences certainly it was influenced by ridley scott's alien 1979 but it was no cheap rip-off unfortunateley that was the case with xtro 2 the second encouter 1990 it had nothing in common with the original one and was nothing more than a mix between alien and aliens to a certain level it was enjoyable but not very good it had it's moments br br no memorable moments for the awful xtro 3 watch the skies what the hell again totally unrelated to the previous films so why the title just another way to cash in on the cult success of the first one but this time it really is bad no idea what andrew divoff wishmaster is doing here the rest of the unknown cast if unconvincing that can also be said about the creature you can hardly see it and that may be for the best because it is bad and awful the awful story is boring and uninspired i use the word awful a lot but that perfectly describes this cheap mess avoid it at all cost
