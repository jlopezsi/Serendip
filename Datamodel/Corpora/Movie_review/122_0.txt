stylish thriller hardly this french action film from director luc besson is more confused and unsure about itself than anything else i have seen recently br br the opening action sequence shows some promise and the following action sequences are good however they are sadly too few and far between the drama is dull and erratic and the characters are generally unlikeable anne parillaud and the support cast are unable to involve the audience emotionally br br la femme nikita ends up more like a try hard b-grade action thriller very average br br saturday april 28 1991 balwyn cinema
