though a little bit confusing at times this movie is everything i expected from a ringu prequel the only reason that doesn't make this one my favorite of the series is because it couldn't exist without the others ringu 1 and 2 are more than a prerequisite you have to see them to plainly enjoy this one of course i love asian horror from audition to the eye to chinese ghost story what i mean is if you're not into asian horror films don't start with ringu 0 you might get lost and never want to experience it again if you're a fan of the original ringu and other asian ghost movies go ahead and enjoy you'll get to know a little better who sadako really was before she died how the curse was born and what makes this whole story so sad and scary at the same time i also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with american fastfood film-making so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing the order i suggest to follow if you haven't seen any of the ringu films start with part 1 then part 2 then part 0 there's another movie called rasen which i haven't seen yet so i can't tell you about it
