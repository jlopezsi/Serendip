the hard part about writing this review is separating my feelings about this man paul green his school the school of rock in philadelphia and the documentary about both rock school paul is an arrogant selfish and demeaning man but his school produces some incredible talent and the movie that director don argott made is clever witty and downright funny br br paul green's school of rock has 120 students ages 9 through 17 who learn to play everything from black sabbath to frank zappa and most importantly paul gets his students on stage and teaches them how to perform like a rock star but he's horrible he's like simon cowell in that really mean and insulting kind of way but perhaps that kind of cruelty pushes them to work even harder and practice more to perfect their craft he does everything that any other teacher today would instantly get sued for he curses at them yells at them makes them cry hits them tells them that they suck and asks them if they love satan he does that to pump them up for the black sabbath concert they're about to put on br br it's endlessly amusing to watch 9 year-olds wear all black smear eyeliner all over their eyes draw crosses on their foreheads and write ozzy on their knuckles and to see their mom doing all that for them is even funnier the coolest moment of rock school however is when the very top students are flown to germany to play at zappanele the largest frank zappa festival in the world and they perform with an original member of zappa's band then to have the original band member plus the entire zappanele audience blow before them in praise literally bowing was out of this world not every music student gets an experience like that br br argot does a great job at showing us all sides of paul green's personality i hate him in one scene and love what he does for these kids in the next if rock school does anything it will make you want to get off your butt and start practicingÂ…what ever it is that you love you'll want to pick up an instrument or start painting or get back to studying this movie makes you want to be the best at something and it makes you want to work for it
