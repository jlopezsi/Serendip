and left the series where it was this was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one not as good as the first but pretty good the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this the shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else it looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film even dennis quaid did a bad job in this one if they kept roy schneider it would be worth watching i only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts a part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people i'm tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels jaws 4 the revenge was worse though its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the caribbean jaws 4 plot don't see this or part 4 because they both suck just watch the first two
