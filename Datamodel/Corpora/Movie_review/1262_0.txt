in light of brittany murphy's recent and tragic death i decided to watch some of her movies i'd never seen and i found this one the devil's arithmetic is the kind of movie that would be good for middle-schoolers who don't know much about the holocaust it doesn't dumb down the atrocities of a concentration camp but it doesn't focus on depicting them in graphic detail either while there are several deaths many happen off-screen and those we do see are bloodless but blood-chilling br br fans of the book which i read several times in middle school and early high school will probably be disappointed there's no gitl rivka is hannah's cousin and some of the more suspenseful episodes of the novel are gone however if you've never read the book or can set the book aside the film has an interesting story and does a good job of establishing a culture that will be unfamiliar to the viewer brittany murphy is probably the best thing about this movie and i don't say that out of pity she plays rivka as a sweet kind devoutly religious young woman who is the movie's emotional backbone kirsten dunst is well kirsten dunst she isn't bad in the part but she doesn't make herself terribly memorable in it either br br older audiences might think the devil's arithmetic sanitizes the holocaust but i'd have to disagree it doesn't whitewash what happened it just presents it in a way that won't cause twelve-year-olds to have vivid gory nightmares if the film has a large flaw it's that hannah never develops much of a personality beyond a bratty kid who has to adjust to life in the camp that was the flaw of the book too i think at the same time that blankness allows viewers hannah's age to imagine themselves as hannah and react and learn as she does
