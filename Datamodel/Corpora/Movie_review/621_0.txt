i was drawn into days in dec 06 when chelsea was treating nick horribly just before he turned into the lonely splicer for a few days i turned it on just waiting for that storyline br br then i met bo which shocked me as he looks so much like my husband eventually i recognized steve from an episode of the nanny as i'd never watched any soaps before this then i followed religiously the shawn and belle escape from phillip who i couldn't stand at the time and sami and lucas's wedding triangle br br now i'm all about phillip and belle since i'm new perhaps i never saw much chemistry between belle and shawn i think phillip's macho side is a more normal alpha-male just determined and pained looking at times all that money weighing him down it seems totally realistic to me that belle would be hard pressed to ignore the support and safety phillip could provide nature calls i've been reading that regular fans are unhappy with belle's new promiscuous side but this is a soap opera right anyway since enjoying this show so much i've put some time into the other soaps but this one seems in a higher class altogether the parenting tidbits of advice actually help me with my kids and spouse i guess just feel like i can relate to the characters despite whatever plot mechanism is underplay br br thanks to all who work for this show
