i saw very little of the book in this film this is not to say that this alone makes for a poor movie as a matter of fact it was better that the book despite the fact that i still thought it was awful i personally feel that the only reason any one bothered to make this book into a film was because of the shock value melissa's sexual exploits were for the most part disgusting and whatever was left over was disturbing i'm not prude but that book nauseated me and the movie wasn't much better at least the movie had some kind of a story the book was more or less a detailed list of all the raunchy things she had done in her past there was no connection between her and any part of her family no mention of the grandmother that figures quite largely into the movie's plot not a peep all in all if you have the choice between the movie or the book pick the movie at least it is shorter
