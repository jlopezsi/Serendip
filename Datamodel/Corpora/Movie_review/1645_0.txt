the director's debut pusher was an excellent tribute to american cinema abel ferrara scorsese and a portrait of the drugworld of copenhagen but bleeder is much more personal mature and grim film the story deals with the relationship of four friends b-filmfanatics a videostoreowner his helper a soon-be-a-dad and his girl's violent brother things gets complicated between the last two when the guy starts beatin his pregnant girl and the brother's threatin to retaliate when the girl loses her unborn baby after a beatin things get very ugly there's no real reason for the violence which makes the mood of the movie extremely creepy the characters and dialogue are very believable and impossible to forget the few very violent scenes are so unexpected that you'll jump in seat the film are also filled with nods to exploitation cinema clip from lustig's maniac vigilante andy warhol's frankenstein etc it's made on a low budget but is beautifully filmed and acted with a great glampunk soundtrack bleeder is a movie that gets under your skin for days so check out this masterpiece
