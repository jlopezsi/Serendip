it was great to see what happened to the old crew after they were arrested in the original but unfortunately the entire storyline is pretty much the same this time around br br example in the original jake and elwood go and find their old band buddies and play some gigs in 2000 elwood and mack go and find elwood's old band buddies and play some gigs hmmm br br it was terrific that they managed to get together most of the original cast minus john belushi john candy and cab callaway for obvious reasons and it's even more incredible who else they got the addition of eric clapton bb king bo didley johnny lange paul shaffer blues traveler and many many other big names gives the movie more life than it would have otherwise br br the main difference between the original and this one is that elwood is taking care of an orphan for the penguin the nun he adds to the story just a little bit giving them a good reason to be chased by the police br br and there are still monster car chases and car crashes
