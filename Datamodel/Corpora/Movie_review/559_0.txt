this movie really tries to rip off nightmare on elm street but it does the worst job possible instead of freddy kruger there is some stupid clown who just isn't funny with his stupid jokes then the police officer tries to be funny and he's not funny at all the mom acts like she doesn't care at all about being in the movie and i've seen girls in rock bands who act tough it isn't anything new at all this movie is suppose to be about fast food but they only show the fast food restaurant about two times most of the time there is a carnival or time in the bedroom it is lame as can be and the best part was the fact that it ended i really loved nightmare on elm street and it's a shame that they tried to rip off such a great horror movie nothing can top nightmare on elm street so don't even try never ever ever ever ever ever watch this movie
