we all heard of the holocaust we all know about the evil nazis and the atrocities that happened during that horrible time but none of us were there it's hard to imagine what it was like and what those people went through br br this is the story of a modern girl in a jewish family she is not interested in hearing the stories of her relatives who survived the concentration camps because the idea is so foreign to her it's almost laughable.she reluctantly attends a passover seder with her parents where her aunts and uncles talk about the camps and she just dismisses the conversation when she goes to put out the ceremonial cup of wine for elijah the profit she is transported in time to a village in poland i think it was poland everyone recognizes her as hannah her ancestor she was named after she wakes up in a surreal wizard of oz like setting where she is awaken after an apparent illness her cousin rifka played so sweetly by brittany murphy)tries to help her jar her memory of being her cousin from lublin who is visiting they walk through their quaint village as everyone is preparing for a wedding hannah is confused but seems to just go with her new reality without too much question br br after the wedding is over several cars pull up to the village with nazis with guns and trucks to transport the jews to the camps the people are scared and confused but hannah is the most terrified as she has the terrible forsight of what is about to happen br br she tries to figure out what is going on whether she is dreaming hallucinating or what but eventually realizes she is now a jew in a concentration camp during world war 2 like it or not and she has to let fate play out br br this movie is powerful to see the holocaust from the perspective of someone who already knows what has happened is chilling from the time they arrive at the camp and are stripped of their clothes dignity money possessions have their hair shaved are forced into slave labor and eventually murdered obviously the girl hannah's life would be changed forever if she ever woke up from the nightmare br br great film
