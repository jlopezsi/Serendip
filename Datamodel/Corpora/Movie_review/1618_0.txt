while the story is bog standard with only one twist the film is a technical gem it's shot largely on location in l.a and using a minimum of additional lighting and ambient sound br br cast is worthy of note a lot of future stars here not only sterling hayden in the title role but a very young charlie bronson also timothy carey is a wonderful hood he steals every scene he's in great cinematography it's a joy to watch br br the dvd i laid my hands on includes commentary from james ellroy worth listening to and so few of these things are ellroy is a character and he talks a length about the genre and how this film influenced his work on things like l.a confidential br br my version was also bundled with decoy which is actually referenced in the commentary to crime wave decoy is also a gem a bizarre gem
