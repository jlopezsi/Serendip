i feel like i'm committing sacrilege to admit i enjoy this film especially since i'm a huge film noir aficionado purists might be shocked to see classics cannibalized for a comedy of all things but i feel there is also a reverence angle that can be introduced to the argument it also can intensify exposure to a larger mass audience and thus promoting growth the issue for me however is that dead men don't wear plaid is one very funny film br br with the best faux authenticity another sterling effort by michael chapman blending of its day steve martin in on spot comic dead pan mixes with the greats of american cinema in a cleverly devised parody on film noir as private eye rigby reardon he crosses paths with an hysterical barbara stanwyck and a homicidal alan ladd among a dozen other stars of bygone era the plot has a big sleep similarity and is just as confusing which allows martin and director alan reiner to create a steady jigsaw puzzle of laughs with a fresh original approach it slows at times with the present day cast but when the stars are out the film becomes capable of inducing parody and awe at the same time
