a couple of foreign office clerks are very bored at work and their attention wanders br br the 1950's never look like much fun to me give me a time tunnel and the 50's wouldn't be the first number i dial up br br with a modest budget and a bit of nerve this series looks back with nostalgia on this buttoned up decade where a bit of peroxide and hint of stocking sent the boys wild i bit like today now that i think about it this is fun and i love the way mcgregor plays the virgin office boy not that he wasn't a bit younger back then br br a fun bit of tv fluff although like most of potter's work it goes on too long
