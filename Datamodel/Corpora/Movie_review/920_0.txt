it seems that people watch this movie only to give it a below par ratings well i liked this picture and the three others that were with me also liked it too for 1981 i would consider it pretty high tech but for today a little dated but when i watch any movie i always want to know when it was made so i won't judge it by contemporary standards we all liked it and i will give it a solid 8/10
