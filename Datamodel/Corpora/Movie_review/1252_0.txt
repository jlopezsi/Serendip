if you have the chance to watch the movie or read the book i highly recommend that you do so both are extremely moving and touching works of art that should be respected no matter what the subject matter is people need to be educated on what happened and not just brush it aside like any other event in history when i watched it the first time i had to stop it and come back to it later in the day because it was so intense once you get into it you can really connect with the characters and it's almost like you feel what they felt br br every time i watch this movie or read the book i cry without fail that is what makes it an excellent piece of art
