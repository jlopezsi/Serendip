i'm not sure i get the lower-than-usual imdb voter rating for roberta vs shall we dance 1937 and some of the other weaker astaire rogers films the script and dialog are far better than swd and the story of vernon irene castle 1939 even if the musical numbers are not quite up to say a damsel in distress 1937 follow the fleet 1936 or the remarkable if somewhat technically inferior flying down to rio 1933 br br i imagine that r&a fans might have wanted more dancing and less irene dunne and randolph scott randolph scott but the lead love story featured two of the very hottest stars of the day much as gene raymond and delores del rio in fdtr were in 33 br br question did dunne insist on singing in the old bel canto style to try to keep up with rogers she shouldn't have ginger's waaaaay out front here and no one's going to catch her br br in fact this is the best of rogers's acting performances in the entire series dancer glib wisecracker foreign accents and comedic timing galore that and boy did bernie newman put her in some utterly breathtaking art deco outfits br br speaking of fashions if you're into that roberta's a film about a fashion designer and the fashion show scenes are black white mind blowers br br musically the memorable tunes include lovely to look at i'll be hard to handle and smoke gets in your eyes respectively by eddie duchin gerry kern and gerry kern not exactly a couple of lightweights and al newman handles them superbly br br the digitally restored print they've been showing on tcm is terrific btw
