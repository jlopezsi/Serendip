unfortunately this movie falls prey to an overwrought treatment of what many would consider to be a still esoteric but increasingly popular subject with its formulaic and simplistic narrative of california's burgeoning wine culture the characters are stereotypical and were portrayed in a manner that we would expect from the more industrial-minded aspects of hollywood br br despite these faults it was pleasurable to watch rickman portray mr spurrier whose work today within the wine world is often admirable for those reviewers that did not see the film such as fellow reviewer luisinho biker who made a reference to a war i am uncertain what this has to do with anything the importance of the judgment of paris was more than just beneficial to american vintners it also showed that french winemakers may have been resting on their laurels and had not reevaluated how they had been producing wine many nations including the united states realized that winemaking could be approached using new techniques while still adhering to terroir and tradition of course there is not a best wine a better movie may show that wine is a deeply faceted staple that can be interpreted in many ways perhaps the up-coming judgment of paris will highlight the depth of oenology and those that enjoy its fruits
