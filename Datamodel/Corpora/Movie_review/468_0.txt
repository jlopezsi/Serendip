swimmers is a lovely poetic movie about a young girl who needs an operation and the impact of the crisis on her family which does not have health insurance the script touches on many universal themes family friendship depleted fishing grounds health care problem drinking the performances are wonderful especially cherry jones robert knott and tara devon gallagher i saw swimmers at the seattle international film festival and i strongly recommend it it just won the portugese film festival so i am hopeful it will get a distributor as it deserves to be seen by a wide audience swimmers is reminiscent of tender mercies and robert knott's performance reminds me of robert duvall's in tender mercies a huge compliment as tender mercies is one of my favorite movies see swimmers if you get the chance
