in the sequel to the cult horror hit ginger snaps brigitte(emily perkins finds herself transforming into the same monster that killed her sister she has been injecting herself with too much monkshood she o.d's is mistaken for a junkie and wins herself a trip to the happier times rehab center there brigitte meets a young girl named ghost(tatiana maslany)who is a very strange and curious kid and might help brigitte with the cure the two of them become very close almost like sisters even but now brigitte has a bigger problem another werewolf has been stalking her and now he wants to mate i am probably the biggest fan of ginger snaps and i was highly anticipating the sequel as soon as i saw the opening credits i knew that i was in for a treat emily perkins was simply amazing the gore was beautiful and the dark humor and atmosphere were similar to the first one the makeup was better where as the first ginger snaps was more emotional of course it wasn't as good as the first one but what sequel ever really is like i said the acting and makeup was awesome and the soundtrack was great too i also really enjoyed the short but sweet appearances by my beloved katharine isabelle as ginger the ending was very disappointing though it kind of ruined the whole movie for me but if i forget the last 10 minutes this movie was excellent and almost gave me as much pleasure as the first one i would give ginger snaps ii:unleashed 8/10
