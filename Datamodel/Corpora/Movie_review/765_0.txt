this movie supposedly sends an environmental message and that's certainly true but if you look closely it's really a fig leaf like one of those little flaps on a string that constitute the sole bit of clothing worn by the villagers for an updated tarzan movie br br that said this movie is tremendous entertainment it is exciting almost all the way through and when it's slow there are lots of cute teenage girls in the altogether to gaze at in fact there's a demographically striking abundance of teenage girls in this particular tribe br br favorite scene during the courtship ritual tomme is given a club and is supposed knock out his girl in front of the villagers and then carry her off into the forest she cowers he hesitates waves the club around she glares at him and whispers do it right so he hits her and she makes a show of being knocked out the whole courtship ritual is beautifully staged i cannot attest to its authenticity but it's perfectly clear as he defends her from menacing dudes refuses to be carried off by the other girls etc the sheer enthusiasm portrayed is remarkable br br powers boothe playing a dam engineer makes a dashing trader horn-type he has a great scene when he wakes up in the village only to see his son tomme sleeping peaceful and embracing his girl both practically nude in the next hammock the expressions that run across his face are priceless br br the fierce people live up to their name but i am dubious that people who live in nature can be so infected with violence br br i learned something you can climb a high-rise by wrapping vines around your feet who knew the dam business at the end was totally righteous but really pretty preposterous br br and how about that shot of the eagle in flight taken from about two feet away pretty neat br br terrific hollywood movie you bet werner herzog not so much
