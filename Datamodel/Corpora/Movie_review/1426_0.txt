this film is a total waste of celluloid it's the story of a german tiger tank caught behind us lines during ww 2 there is no one in this film that you will recognize.the acting is terrible period the german part of the soundtrack is dubbed in english so the mouth movements don't match the words the musical score doesn't match the film at all it bears a strong resemblance to the score of many of the early spaghetti westerns errors abound the nazi tiger tank is in fact an old us m-48 the germans keep talking about needing gas all tiger tanks were diesel-powered there are errors in the small arms on both sides about the only thing that kept me watching was the sexy blond wife of a local restaurant owner shows plenty of leg and provides a bit of eye candy she bears a distinct resemblance to nancy sinatra back in her these boots are made for walking days the dialog is poorly written clich ridden and woodenly delivered some of the acting is so poor that i found myself laughing when there is no humor in the film it's difficult to believe that this director had already done a half dozen films prior to this tripe and actually did several more afterwards don't bother with this one at all
