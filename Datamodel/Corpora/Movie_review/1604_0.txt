bette davis dominates the whole movie with a mesmerizing performance,which earned her a second oscar as the love of her life we find a young and handsome henry fonda.davis,who sometimes overacted gloriously is kept more subdued by master director william wyler her performance is the better for it.george brent,playing the other male lead has rarely been better.as the southerner unable to change his obsolete ways,he's a marvel.the musical score by max steiner is one of his best and adds to the brilliant depiction of a bygone era depiction of african-americans in movies from this era are often very racist but i found some scenes were they were portrayed more sympathetic than in other movies of the thirties jezebel is one of the best movies i have seen with bette davis
