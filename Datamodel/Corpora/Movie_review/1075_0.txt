i strongly disagree with many of the other reviews of this film it is a very faithful adaptation given hollywood's history of adapting for the screen and one of my favorite movies it is not entirely faithful i.e operation bareback which i would have enjoyed was forgone probably due to the mass nudity that it would entail the love interest the storyline and the characters were very close to the novel some criticize it as a ripoff of the invasion of the body snatchers but the novel actually pre-dates that work so who copied from whom the scope of the movie was scaled back and little mention was made of landings and conflicts in other countries but this may be due to editing exigencies the aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree as she still refuses to watch it again and it manages without the gore of many similar movies although it is rather violent br br compared to another recent heinlein adaptation starship troopers this film was much truer to the author's original work and is a thrilling and thoughtful treat sadly it looks like no sequel will be forthcoming to carry the battle to the moons of saturn
