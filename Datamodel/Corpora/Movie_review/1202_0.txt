i really like the show and the virile manliness and cool humor exhibited by darren gavin i'm sorry he has passed on some feminists might find the humor demeaning but we have to remember it was mid-60s my only criticism is that it was mainly filmed in hollywood except for a very few exterior shots of new york it is very californiaish particularly in some outdoors shots which are definitely not new york countryside that's a failing if you really want authenticity about a new york detective particularly when you compare it to naked city which was filmed on the streets of the city luckily some of the episodes are now on dvd i wish there would be more of these classic series on tv
