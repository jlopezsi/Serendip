ah the glass house this is the movie i've tried to forget i got dragged to the movie theater with my friends to see this i just knew that i wasn't going to get into it i feel bad because i always say to people even if you have a gut feeling that a movie is going to be bad just try to have an open mind and enjoy the film my main problem though i can't stand leelee sobieski seriously ever since i saw heaven on earth her face just i can't describe it she annoys the heck out of me but i did decide rather than just complain through the whole movie i would just try to sit and see maybe if the film could have been worth the watch at least well i was wrong br br after losing their parents grace and dave in a car accident ruby and rhett baker are placed under the guardianship of erin and terry glass former neighbors/parents best friends and childless couple who live in a large glass house in malibu life is great for both siblings at first however ruby soon discovers that her new foster parents are after the siblings 4 million trust fund ruby discovers that the car her parents died in was a bmw loaned from the glass company and suspects that mr glass was responsible for their deaths mrs glass watches an old home video of her and ruby on a beach happy and healthy then overwhelmed with guilt she overdoses and dies ruby wakes up the next morning with mrs glass dead body lying next to her shocked to find his wife dead mr glass traps ruby and rhett in the basement eventually the two escape after a brutal car accident due to mr glass tampering with his own car in the same fashion as he did with the kids parents br br honestly this movie is just a waste of time it's a very mediocre thriller that is well for me at least is just very predictable the acting is lame as well as the story but i will compliment the set if you want me to give this movie a positive comment there ya go it's just a weak script bad cast and i can't wait to get this bad taste out of my mouth from this stupid movie just writing this comment is making my health deteriorate i have to stop i'm sorry just stay away from this movie plant a tree watch paint dry that's much more useful then watching this movie br br 1/10
