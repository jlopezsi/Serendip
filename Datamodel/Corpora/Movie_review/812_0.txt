saw this movie a couple of nights ago at the sydney film festival and really wish i'd given it the biggest of misses what were the festival directors thinking what an absolute waste of time yes the lead played a guy with and without la moustache very well but what was the point who cares if it was his imagination who cares if his wife and friends were playing a nasty trick on him this was the most indulgent piece of film making i've ever had the misfortune of sitting through br br watching him travel back and forth on the hong kong ferry was tedious and just plain stupid hallelujah it finally ended and i got to go home you've been warned
