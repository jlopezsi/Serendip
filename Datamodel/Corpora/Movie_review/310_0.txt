this is an excellent scifi the genre is usually dominated by touchy-feely stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center or horror stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center in either case man is shredded into little pieces for the audiences pleasure i find both of these types to not be scifi i think of them as fantasy with the watchable part being scifi br br this movie avoids the pitfalls of femininazation and horrorization is that redundant and instead remains true to the original intent of the genre a true scifi 9/10<br br i found the ending annoying which if cut would push this movie up to 9.5/10 but half-a-point does not ruin this movie at all if you like real scifi's like this one then also see the movie version of lost in space br br zafoid<br br ps kudos to the special effects they were absolutely brilliant from equipment to backdrops and the robotics br br z
