this movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever it's the same movie all over again but without the intelligence humour and charm that made the first film such a winner br br eddie murphy returns as fish-out-of-water cop axel foley and he's at his loudest and most annoying here shouting at the top of his lungs and speaking so fast that it's difficult to understand what he's saying nutty professor 2 had the same problem with those two and another 48 hours eddie seems to make a mess of sequels br br director tony scott was hired to direct the sequel he was hot off top gun the year before but he's not a comedy director he gives beverly hills cop ii his usual glossy look but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows br br you can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when ronny cox is shot foley's foul-mouthed boss inspector todd would be killed off in the next movie br br brigitte nielsen for the 5 minutes she was on hollywood's a-list is in among the cast she only got the part after sylvester stallone invited eddie murphy over for dinner sly apparently fell under the table laughing at eddie's rocky impression br br the screenplay for beverly hills cop was nominated for an oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was this movie got no such recognition actor and director mel smith once saw this movie at a royal premiere in london and he said that is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life i would have left but you couldn't as there was royalty there i couldn't agree more you should only watch this film at gunpoint otherwise don't waste 2 hours of your life that you won't get back
