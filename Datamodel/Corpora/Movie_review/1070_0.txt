this is a unknown very satisfying alien film this film moves along at a nice pace the aliens are creepy and the action is almost non stop they throw a lot of great turns in the story and the acting is pretty solid the film even has a cameo from the talentless richard belzer who actually does a decent job i would have liked some nudity in this story but you can't have it all this film is pre cgi so it has an awesome selection of effects done on set it's hard to believe they could make such a good movie from a hienlin book whatever just see it
