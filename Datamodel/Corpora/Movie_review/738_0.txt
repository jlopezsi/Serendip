16-year-old boarding school student nancy jenny tamburi arrives in town after her mother commits suicide she is taken in by her stepfather marco silvano tranquilli who has already moved in his mistress gianna rosalba neri things get a bit strange when nancy begins to suspect her mother didn't commit suicide and puts the moves on both of her hosts this is a nifty little thriller from silvio amuck amadio with enough twists and turns to keep you interested the main mystery isn't too hard to guess but there is a nice extra twist at the end and of course another one for good measure tamburi and the gorgeous neri spend a lot of their screen time nude and that certainly helps too quite possibly the best thing about the film is a theme that is so catchy with amadio using it at every opportunity you will definitely be humming it for days after watching this one
