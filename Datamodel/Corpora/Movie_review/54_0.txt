the last time i saw this film must have been nearly fifteen years ago during that time although i had forgotten the title entirely there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams i remember not really following the plot as a child but i recalled finding it a very beautiful and b unbelievably dark certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that like in the film cube every last character is expendable and the image that probably haunted me most of all the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason many reviewers have compared the story to romeo juliet and although i wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child i'm sure i recall the realization that however majestic and omnipotent the combatants sea and fire in this case the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory pretty disturbing themes for a film allegedly for children now that i have recently rediscovered the title(s i would greatly enjoy finding this film again if only for old time's sake it's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me and for all those out there who also were touched by this film i'd recommend it in a double billing with martin rosen's watership down a similarly lovely and chilling animation
