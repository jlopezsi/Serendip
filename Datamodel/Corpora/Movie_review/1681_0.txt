here is a movie musical what is a movie musical forget the story it is slight at best involving a he-man scott inheriting a designing house in paris it comes complete with assistant dunne and a phony countess rogers and a band complete with astaire as leader which has come to paris with him why he is traveling with the band or why rogers is getting away with the phony royalty bit is never really explained to be honest the first half of the movie is totally missable and rather confusing scott as a love interest unable to see it dunne as a singer hard to take having said that then there is the dancing of astaire and rogers unmatched by anyone before or since no wonder tap and ballroom dancing has gone somewhat out of vogue once you see these two perform everything and everyone else is a letdown the music of jerome kern is some of the best ever put out for a movie if you're under 35 you may never have had the opportunity to listen to smoke gets in your eyes i won't dance and the rest do yourself a favor watch this movie just for the music and dancing a wag once said that fred astaire looked so good in a tuxedo that he rented himself out to them no one else looks so at ease in top hat and tails the clothes are dated maybe but you get an idea of what real glamour can be yards and yards of exotic looking material draped over some delicious looking models including a brief glimpse of the redoubtable lucille ball well worth the time it takes to watch
