maybe it was just the fact that i watched this movie on television with commercial breaks while doing homework and therefore wasn't exactly giving it my full attention and deep scrutiny but i rather liked it it was pretty funny most of the time though it was all pretty obvious but that's all right journey's more important than the destination and all that br br the acting wasn't perfect and all around there could have been improvements but i felt fortunate to have stumbled upon this movie it makes an awesome excuse to take a break from studying every few minutes and stare at christopher walken
