this show is awesome i love the way it is acted out and how out of the ordinary monk is i don't know if i could put up with him the detective irl but its one of the most interesting shows that has been aired recently this show has its own quirks and is worth watching if you enjoy reading robert parker books please watch this show so it can stay on the air
