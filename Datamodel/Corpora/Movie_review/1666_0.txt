my take on this movie helen westley great randolph scott a tall hunka sweetness ginger rogers has nice accent irene dunne lovely singer fred astaire great especially playing those organ fingers indianians and indians a nice touch tongue twister the elevator being stuck always gets some laughs out of me br br i also like the 1950s remake lovely to look at br br i loved the little black vulgar dress the front at least the back i would have re-designed to have more substance around the waistline br br scott's fianc gf was a miserable cold fish cold block of ice i am glad she got talked into getting the terrible dress that was so funny and an ironic comeuppance for her br br a sweet movie 10/10
