when a newly wed couple traveling in hungary are involved in a traffic accident in which their driver is killed and the car is destroyed they seek shelter and aid in the home of a strange and devil-worshiping friend boris karloff of their chance companion bela lugosi it turns out that dr werdegast lugosi has a score to settle with poelzig karloff and is looking for his wife and daughter after a long and enforced separation but poelzig is searching for a fresh human sacrifice to satan and sees the young bride as perfect for the task there are a few twists in the plot from this point on which i won't reveal here but they do add interest to the film even if somewhat predictable br br the black cat like the raven is named after edgar allan poe's writings but has very little to do with its namesake the only reference to a black cat in the movie is werdegast's phobia of them and really this could have been left out without affecting much of the plot or overall effect of the film br br that said i still enjoyed this film especially because of the acting and dialog between karloff and lugosi it just seemed to real and so perfect the plot was a bit thin but entertaining nevertheless the setting was very different from the old castle settings of frankenstein and dracula but its modern feel i'm sorry i know little about architecture and interior design still managed to carry a menace and dark atmosphere that was very appropriate
