i never liked dennis potter until i saw this series i don't like musicals the idea of a group of people bursting into spontaneous communal song never appealed to me but the combination of scenario a post second world war era where the war is now fought as much in the halls of whitehall as on the battlefield and britain is losing and music british 50's just hit the right note with me pun intended the characters are superb this was the first thing i ever saw ewan mcgregor in and the situations genuine the relationships between the junior ranks in both military and civilian life in the era they are set are really believable so my dad says i loved the music so much i bought the cd i just wish they would bring it out on dvd thanks dennis
