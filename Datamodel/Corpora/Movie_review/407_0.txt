this movie was made and distributed by the mormon church but unlike most films that fall into the above category this movie is not about religion missionary work joining any church etc and so forth this short film could have quite possibly been made by anyone that is what makes it so good it is a story about a trader coming to one of the small islands of the world to get himself a wife the island is so small there is only room enough for one village there are none of the modern conveniences of the rest of the world and everything is either built by the villagers or acquired by traders who visit the island by boat and trade for their handmade goods in this village it is custom to bargain and pay the father of the bride in dairy cows this may sound like a serious film but it really is rather quite funny and has some real classic lines to it that i'm sure will endear you to the film the story is simple yet original and the flow and pacing for the film is perfect if you can pick it up it would be worth the effort
