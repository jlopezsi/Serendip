this is that rarity amongst post-apocalyptic cinema a film that dares to show people trying to enjoy life in the ruins of civilization although it's eighties heritage shows through in an overzealous use of neon tacky dance-rock and the frankly dodgy nightclub scenes any film that can combine a nuclear war with disco has to be applauded br br our heroes emerge after a childhood in a bomb shelter their only guide to the real world has been the work of crime writers such as raymond chandler convinced therefore that everyone wears sharp suits talks like a hipster and goes down after one swift punch to the jaw they embark on their journey back to civilization br br although the film starts by gently mocking the conventions of post-apocalyptic cinema disco dancing midgets in white suits for instance no i'm not making this up the bravery of the script dwindles and about half way through it degenerates into the very generic twaddle that it sets out to mock still as generic twaddle goes it is enjoyable and entertaining and hey love that disco dancing
