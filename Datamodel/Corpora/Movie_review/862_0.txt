like many people i rented this movie as a clancy fan i had previously read his book netforce and was eager to see it on the tube i now deeply regret my decision to see it at all br br not only was the movie a complete waste of time but its plot was filled with more holes than a bullet-riddled suv on an a-10 target range and held about as much water if somebody asks you where some important aspect of a workable plot went you could simply reply it fell into a plot hole and that would be the end of it br br the entire movie was packed to the gills with bad acting and painfully extreme deviations from what had been the good storyline of the book both the original storyline and all the cool action scenes fell into some of the movie's gaping plot holes somewhere in the process of production and clancy's interesting and intelligent characters were also conspicuously missing neither the plot nor the ending resembled those of the book in any way and the ever present boredom and disgust of the movie left you emotionally drained to the point where you'd wish all the shallow no-can-act characters would just hurry up and die br br i don't write this review to simply be critical of this piece of poorly-conceived garbage but rather as a warning to all the clancy fans out there still considering seeing this movie so here's your warning to the clancy fan whether you've read the book or not if are given the opportunity to watch this movie don't even think about it you turn around and you run away run for your life and don't look back or you are likely regret it for the rest of your days
