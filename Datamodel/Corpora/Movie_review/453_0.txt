this film tells a compelling story the writing and the characters are so real and portrayed so well you can't help but care about them emma could be your niece you could know a merrill in your life this was a movie that i was glad to see i also felt like i really spent time in their lives and didn't just watch a story robert knott cherry jones sarah paulson and tara devon gallagher are all top rate actors and to have them all in the same film is great there was not a weak link in the film the music was complementary and not overpowering also things sounded like they actually do in real life not the typical big movie sound effects and foley a lot of care obviously went into this story
