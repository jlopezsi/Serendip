truly fresh and new ideas rarely make it to film the hole based on the novel after the hole by guy burt is a good exception to this it is seldom that we see a top quality thriller but this movie is well cast well directed and works wonderfully the story is quite simple really it relies on strong characterisation and good dialogue all the cast give good performances and thora birch is outstanding this thriller really does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout it is very dark very creepy and has a terrifying atmosphere i would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller it isn't in the same league as se7en and silence of the lambs but it is better than most thrillers that are released br br 8/10 a great film
