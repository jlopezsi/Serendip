this is in my opinion dudley moore's funniest movie however the cast of characters in this movie also aid in helping with the laugh's of course the advertisement's designed to be brutally honest about products/services that are created by these members of a mental hospital are the highlight of this film even though the advertisement's probably would not work in real life and would probably cause consumer outrage in this politically correct society we live in today e.g visit new york it's not as filthy as you think it makes for some good laughs i highly recommend this movie for those that enjoy a good comedy
