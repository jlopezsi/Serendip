win ben stein's money was one of the best shows that aired on comedy central when south park and the daily show were rather new it was highly creative and almost always witty and funny ben stein best known as a character actor and commercial spokesperson with a monotone voice and tweed sweater comes to life as both host and contestant he and co-host jimmy kimmell had an excellent chemistry and their exchanges of jokes and insults were among comedy central's finest moments very few of the questions were dumbed down for mass consumption and the show's entertaining and quick pace made it a welcome contrast to the dull and ridiculous who wants to be a millionaire the show did suffer a bit when nancy pimental took over as co-host as she lacked jimmy's chemistry he later went on to co-host the insipid man show but she was fairly competent as a comedian ben showed his true talent as an entertainer here and it resulted in his short-lived spin-off turn ben stein on if your cable providers offer the game show network due yourselves a favor a catch a rerun of win ben stein's money if you're not too busy you won't regret it
