though he's the title character welter pigeon plays a back seat to the villain the villain is played smoothly by the superb joseph schildkraut the rest of the cast is fun nat pendleton is schildkraut's bodyguard donald meek is pigeon's sidekick and a beekeeper to boot florence rice is very good in what looks like a sympathetic role and is though she's initially on the wrong side of the law br br what makes this stand out is its plot we see this at the very start so i'm giving nothing away schildkraut is blowing up ships at sea to collect on their insurance it's shocking to think of such cold-blooded behavior but to underline the heinous nature of his crime we see the captain and some crew members chatting just before theirs is blown to bits br br this isn't the greatest of jacques tourneur movies but his masterly touch is evident schildkraut is often photographed in profile and generally partially in shadow he reminds one of a streamlined custom-made sports car of the time he is stylish and almost impossibly cruel
