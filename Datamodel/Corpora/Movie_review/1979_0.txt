after reading the reviews of this film on this site i became interested and subsequently spent nearly two hours of my life watching it these are hours i will never get back br br i would bet that gay men would find this movie very interesting but if you are not a gay man i'd recommend you spend your time watching something else i kept waiting for something to happen that would grab my attention seeing naked or nearly naked men particularly within the context of homosexuality does not offend me it just does not interest me also for me the men they were portraying as it is based on a true story were too stupid to be sympathetic br br not a bad film just not very interesting br br
