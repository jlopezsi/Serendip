i am a die hard fan of the original ginger snaps and this sequel is like having to use windows 3.1 my whole life i tried to allow for the curse of high expectations what i did not expect was that this movie would raise them by starting with an excellent original story concept good music an edgy atmosphere and a solid gold performance by emily perkins those are the only things i can recommend about this film however and half of those are thrown out midway through the story br br the film's downfall is the screenplay which was written by megan martin who apparently had no previous screen writing experience true karen walton who wrote the original with director john fawcett also had no experience but she also worked on that script for four years it is harder to write for somebody else's character creations for a sequel to a successful movie with a fan base only chintziness could explain hiring a first-time writer for the sequel br br so with practically no help from the dialog perkins carries the entire first half of the film as the lonely doomed brigitte bereft of ginger and bitterly fighting her own animalistic changes the difference in brigitte's character after the traumas she suffered in the first movie are both believably sad and shocking showing that perkins is an actress of the highest caliber when brigitte is found unconscious on a street with needle and cut marks on her arms authorities assume she is a junkie and put her into a teen rehab center it turned out that monkshood did not cure the curse it simply delays it so she is trapped and can't prevent her transformation in a place where she endangers many people and of course the staff doesn't believe her br br from this mind-blowing story-concept we go to tedium as the movie puts 75 minutes of material into 90 minutes midway through it comes to life briefly and then changes directions giving up everything it had going for it martin had written brigitte into a corner and so changed subject i must admit here that i did not like the approach of dooming brigitte from the beginning and the twist at the end made me want to shoot the dvd as a traitor br br martin has made brigitte far too restrained including with people who would turn a quaker homicidal she only partially loses her temper once and as a character noted it was measured brundel's law as it applies to werewolves is there are no such thing as pacifist werewolves or rather any werewolf movie depicting them is a bomb while perkins does her best in the many pauses in the dialog depicting brigitte as holding back her fury it simply does not work in a werewolf movie or in a horror movie if the audience is asked to believe that a werewolf could be that restrained they begin to doubt it is even a problem br br katharine isabelle continues her role as ginger who is dead of course and who only brigitte can see isabelle only has about fifteen lines though these are the sorts of lines that can only be delivered in the sleepiest way possible and it can't be called dialog because usually brigitte doesn't answer isabelle's part is almost all commentary and adds nothing to the plot her role seems half contractual obligation half trailer-bait material mostly she just taunts brigitte's about her futile efforts to fight the curse of all people brigitte and ginger should still have a lot to say to each other this is a huge waste of an actress who showed her mettle in the original br br no instead the movie is wrecked by martin's new character tatiana maslani as ghost does a good job as a mentally ill young girl obsessed with comics it's a good character concept really and maslani does do an excellent job even so putting ghost in and making her a major character respectively required an unbelievable explanation and an idiot plot i felt like she belonged in her own movie and was just an intruder here worse she crowded out a larger part for katharine isabelle and the movie is called ginger snaps unleashed right br br finally i have to point out the werewolf makeup is bad in this film i never knew werewolves had sow's ears and third-degree burns on their lips at one point they make perkins look like keith richards and by the end she looks like an orc with an immobile mask so embarrassing that would have looked cheesy in the 60s except for the mask at the end this is probably not the make-up artist's fault the makeup actually looks better on the dvd extras and in the publicity photos than it does in the movie this suggests the problem was with the lighting the director of photography or the director br br nevertheless the movie does get the special effects right for the fully animalized werewolf br br other fans of the original seem to like this movie but i can't help but see it as a major disappointment though not a disaster there was a much better story to be told here unlike the original this did not have karen walton and four years of work on the screenplay it fails on its own promise too and not only by the standards the original set for it
