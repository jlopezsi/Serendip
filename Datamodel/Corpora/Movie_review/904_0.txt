to this films credit i did manage to sit through the whole thing and there are a couple of interesting ideas discussed more lucidly on the back cover of the video than onscreen the main problem though is that the acting suspense and production values are no better than those of a brady bunch episode or any other tv show of that vintage there were stun gun shoot-outs star trek unbelievable resolutions to events holes in the plot and questions left unanswered like why were the girls being killed it was watchable but<br br by no means a great movie it's the story of a plastic surgeon who gave face lifts to some very lovely girls
