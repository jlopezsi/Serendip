two or even three movies for the price of one the first is a travelog that was shot somewhere south of the us border there are some excellent scenes of local fishermen and the culture of ordinary folks rumor has it that these are from orsen wells circa 1942 the second movie is unabashed marketing for tourism in mexico the last shot is of a tourist poster that melts into a plane flying to or from our neighbor to the south the third movie is a lackluster mystery of sorts with tom lawrence at his worst it is not that all of his falcon movies are terrible some are decent the falcon in mexico is not one of his stellar performances and not really worth your time viewing half an hour after the movie you won't rember who did it or care costume design by reni
