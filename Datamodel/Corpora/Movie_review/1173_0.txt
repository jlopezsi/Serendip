i saw the film on amazon because of a fluke it didn't stop the 2 minute preview after the first 2 minutes of the film and i am watching it on hulu now it is a great film and i must warn you i will put major spoilers up br br short synopsis a comfortable underachiever and serial prankster in the midst of their quarter life crisis reunite against childhood enemies in a contemporary suburban epic br br i'd say my favorite character is either swank or officer scar and speaking of scar i am saying how he got his scar and my thoughts on the otherwise described embarrassing scene br br ok so it is a rainy day and caleb montag swank scar and some other kids are playing basket ball scar who's real name is if i remember right jim keeps winning montag gets mad and tackles him scar fights back and repeatedly punches him caleb grabs a trashcan and throws it at scar who gets pushed into a fence his face pressed so hard and i guess the metal also being wet and cold cuts his face he swears he will have vengeance br br what did i think of that scene um it was actually pretty sad if you watch it because of the music the most but it didn't seem so embarrassing to me br br my final thoughts on the film it was great!i can't really say i don't like anything about it 10/10
