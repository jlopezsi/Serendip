i watched this movie like months ago and have remembered it ever since i began to try and hunt down the actor that played manuel i love this kind of stuff and thought that this movie was awesome i don't get why people don't like it is it because it's not gory is it because there no real insight to the killing or is it because it's based on a true story i dunno i must give this movie a 10 because it's just one of the best werewolf movies i've seen and i've seen a lot i love the sensuality of the movie and the way teresa's sister finally gets her head on straight and realizes that he must be killed although i was a little sad i also loved how the movie just went smoothly never contradicting itself like many movies do this movie may not explain werewolves but it does do the race some justice after movies like american werewolf or american werewolf in paris or something like that really gave a bad and false view of them one of the bests i've seen so far
