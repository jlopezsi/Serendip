there are two key ingredients to producing a good spoof not only should the film satirise a specific work or genre but it must serve just as well as a homage were dead men don't wear plaid 1982 to have been made by filmmakers with no interest in film noir it most certainly would not have been such an enjoyable comedy director carl reiner and lead actor steve martin instead actively embrace the clich√©s and conventions of the noir style adding their own jokes of course but primarily drawing humour from the characters deadpan reactions to ridiculous scenarios accusations that the film is a mere gimmick comedy are well-founded but misguided rigby reardon's interactions with cinema's classic hard-boiled characters including humphrey bogart ray milland and james cagney via archival footage are an inspired opportunity for storytelling creativity and the writers ability to meld these disjointed episodes into a coherent and entertaining narrative deserves to be applauded why this hilarious film isn't ranked alongside classics like young frankenstein 1974 is beyond me br br private detective reardon martin opens the picture like most of his predecessors did as he sits in his office considering closing down for a few days he is unexpectedly interrupted by a beautiful woman at the door the intelligent and sophisticated juliet forrest rachel ward begins to speak but upon noticing the newspaper headline of her father's death suddenly faints into rigby's arms so far we've stayed pretty true to the source material but then noticing the breathtaking prettiness of his unconscious female visitor rigby confirms her existence by kissing her and fondling her breasts when juliet awakens and dazedly asks rigby what he's doing the detective offers the logical answer with a straight face that only steve martin could have delivered rachel ward has a bit of lauren bacall about her quietly seductive without being openly so in a nod to bacall's famous put your lips together and blow line from to have and have not 1944 the film features juliet's similar instructions on how to use a telephone the remainder of the cast is derived almost exclusively from 1940s cinema br br what makes dead men don't wear plaid unique among spoof comedies is its use of archive footage from classic film noir thrillers the film's most deserving geniuses are those who worked on the editing costumes and set decoration notably this was the last contribution of legendary costume designer edith head who ironically was asked to precisely replicate some of her own previous work from the 1940s editor bud molin did absolute wonders with the footage he was given not only are we duped into believing that walter neff fred macmurray from double indemnity 1944 might conceivably have fallen for steve martin in a blonde wig but he even somehow manages to transform ingrid bergman in'notorious 1946 into a sinister scheming seductress while the jokes very occasionally skirt the borders of credulity the bullet sucking medical treatment and good taste the adjustments carl reiner's comedy is largely a mature and affectionate love-letter to a style of film that they just don't make like they used to
