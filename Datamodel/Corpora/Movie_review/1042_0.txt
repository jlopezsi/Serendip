this is the only dvd i have had so far that i have not managed to watch all of and i've had alone in the dark br br after an hour of this american fool yacking on about how great he is and how well he can teach these children apparently by shouting at them humiliating them and being generally abusive)i couldn't take any more br br it is simply one guy on an ego trip he even states that he hates it if any of his pupils get better than him br br a complete waste of time would not have been made if it wasn't for the success of school of rock and shouldn't have been anyway
