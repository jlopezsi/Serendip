i haven't seen it as much as everyone else posting here but remembered none-the-less most of it just wanted to say a couple things about it aside from the thought of albert finney as a action hero it was out of necessity of his characters need to know the truth and then getting in too deep i thought he was great in it and the idea of the manipulating with light flashes was brilliant i was never sure if this story didn't just come from a true experiment some where the gun used worked sort of like the bright flash of video games on an epileptic only instead of a seizure you get a mental-pause seems to me to be a completely plausible idea doctors are delving still further into how the brain works for medical healing and understanding of the overall operations only years away from being realistic a mental anesthesia again unless its already real some where spooky<br br for the person who commented about the gun being useful in wars and police procedures just think of it as a regular gun in the wrong hands it does harm i can see all kinds of crime being committed with one of those as you can clearly tell from the movie br br i wouldn't want it to be made to be real but it still would be cool good luck future
