this movie had nothing to build up on the action started right away so there was absolutely no suspense to get you going for something to look forward to these small alien creatures latch on to human's spines and control their nervous system and their entire bodies they can shut down their hearts speak for them and kill them it's not exactly an original story so i didn't expect much and it wasn't good at all also what took away any suspense is every main character was eventually controlled at one point by the aliens very little action and absolutely no suspense or comedy and there's no nude or sex scenes involving julie warner so that was disappointing too she's cute 3/10
