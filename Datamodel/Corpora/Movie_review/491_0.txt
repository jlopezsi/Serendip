contrary to popular opinion i enjoyed the obvious rewrite from the original blues brothers it was a fun way to relive the blues brothers experience 18 years later there are so many of the newer and older generation who never saw the original much less understand the influence that the musical artists involved in the music of the blues brothers had on the music of today i recently watched blues brothers 2000 with some young people who didn't have a clue and seeing things through their fresh eyes made this movie very exciting immediately after they were on the internet looking up various musical artists from the movie so that they could get to know the music that they now loved but had missed out on i say good job dan and that is all that needs to be said
