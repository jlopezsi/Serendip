the sequel to one of the best films ever made and it stinks the only good thing here the is music so i recommend shopping around for the soundtrack br br has anyone noticed that there is no special edition package of both blues brothers movies that's right there isn't because this movie doesn't deserve to be next to the immortal first film it has none of the wit and snappy humor nor charm of the first the jokes that are in the film are direct rip offs from the original br br there isn't even any car chasing and the bad guys get turned into rats bs bs bs just get the soundtrack and avoid this mess 3/10<br br rated pg-13 mild profanity
