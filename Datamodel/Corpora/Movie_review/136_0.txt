let's get the basics out of the way first nikita is a good film with all of the visual flourishes and compelling mood that it seems can be found in the bulk of besson's work if you are coming to this review before having seen leon the professional then my best advice is just to disregard the rest of what follows and take nikita on its own terms hope you enjoy it br br comparison with leon risk of spoilers for both films i know there is some debate amongst film fans over which constitutes the most satisfying experience personally i'd have to pick leon disregarding the sex of the character leon as an enterprise is like a more plush version of besson's 1990 assassin effort it's like a before and after snapshot leon's pretty much compartmentalized his life nikita's struggling to get a grip on hers br br perhaps leon represents the evolution of besson's paternal instinct as he watches his own children grow there is certainly a greater degree of patience shown from outside influences in mathilda's case as opposed to nikita the original street kid is the quintessential animal and although we are shown what instigates her partial transformation her support system is never quite as convincingly solid as that provided by leon and tony br br i suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight as marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly docile mate that he didn't know what he'd come across when he first met her cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom guess what mate you still don't br br having more rounded characters with less rough edges did make it easier for me to become emotionally involved though would leon have opened the door for mathilda if he hadn't been schooled by someone with perhaps similar thought processes to bob in leon we see the individual that nikita would like to become by obtaining her freedom br br those who prefer to dispassionately study people and their actions from a distance might just retain a softer spot for nikita it's certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work though
