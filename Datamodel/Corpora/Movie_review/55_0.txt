i loved this film when i was a kid and i know a lot of you have been having difficulty finding a copy i found this guy online that makes dvd transfers of the film on english dub with menus and everything br br http 8store.8thman.com/ta3.htm<br br i ordered the import from japan as well but that doesn't have english subs or dubs i think these transfers will be true to the childhood experience we remember br br i remember watching this film over and over on a vhs tape when i was little but that tape has long gone and i am aching for a dvd version hopefully sanrio reproduces this classic on dvd because there is definitely a cult following i've been seeing bootlegs of this going for as much as 70 on ebay
