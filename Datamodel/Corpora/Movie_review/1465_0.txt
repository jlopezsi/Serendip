i rented this out of boredom on a sunday night and i regret it i love bad movies i feel an affection for them akin to what one feels for a special education kid they try and fail a lot but you appreciate the merits of the attempt and recognize it for what it is br br that being said there is really one way to surmise this film is awful i have survived viewing of bloodrayne and the un-mst3k'ed manos the hands of fate i and my wife were riffing this ten minutes into the film br br the only redeeming feature in this is the story which was unique compared the usual fare hollywood could take a lesson here in looking for source material however everything else just fell flat face first on to the concrete br br the acting was bad even for a b film the dialog was painful the acting uninspired i've seen more convincing effects in homemade animated films and the editing looks like it was done by a six year old kid riddled with add br br honestly only the most hardcore of lovecraft fans will appreciate this i respect his work but i think he was rolling over in his grave when they wrapped on this pickle
