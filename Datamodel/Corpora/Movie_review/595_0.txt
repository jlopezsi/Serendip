one of the things that i always thought about julius caesar is that in the life of one of the great movers and shakers of the ancient world he's merely a figure in which all kinds of people at the end are busy weaving their schemes around be it his death or his conferred immortality br br antony and brutus are each worried about their place in caesar's affections and brutus figures he's lost out to antony it makes him an easy mark for cassius's plots after the dirty deed of assassination is done it's antony and octavius though they are teaming up against the conspirators you can tell both in this version and in the better fifties version that mgm put out that they will soon be at odds br br charlton heston is a strong antony here but unfortunately for the play to succeed you need an equally strong brutus that's not what you get in jason robards jr for a man who in his time was considered the greatest interpreter of eugene o'neill when it comes to shakespeare the man was out of his league no reflection on him everyone has casting limitations br br a real good interpreter of the bard who played cassius back in 1954 plays caesar here john gielgud is equally fine in both versions and richard johnson and robert vaughn are superb as conspirators cassius and casca and richard chamberlain who was trying very hard to shed his dr kildare image is fine as the cunning octavian who antony ultimately underestimates br br charlton heston in his memoirs takes blame for casting robards and robards himself realized he was miscast oddly enough in that earlier version james mason as brutus was the best one in the film
