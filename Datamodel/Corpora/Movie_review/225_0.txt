combining elements of drama and horror ring 0 is a very worthy installation of the indie horror franchise this film really starts though as a drama telling us the story of sadako in a very linear fashion which deliciously has become the more difficult and confusing path to take since we already know the end of the story we see sadako as a human who is not scary or evil at all but actually seems rather pleasant and almost painfully shy a while later in the film we see that sadako is actually warring desperately with herself and is losing her eventual slide into the monstrosity of the first and second ring films is a sight to behold and hardcore fans will note is echoed by a similar fall of ando mitsuo in the less popular rasen br br the social overtones of this film are also outstanding and a fine addition to the series whereas the first two films are more exercises in combining psychological terror with techno-horror ring 0 takes a more romero-esque approach to the social aspect of sadako's transformation meditating on the cruelty of her peers and the burning need for revenge of one journalist that brings the whole tragedy crashing down br br incidentally although it takes some time this film will scare the hell out of you at the end just wait for it br br very very good see it
