i went into the hole expecting another badly acted slasher flick with crazy teens running around subteranean passage ways i came out a different man this film is a disturbing and cleverly psychologically frightening film with a very low blood and sex rating this film instead shocks by how it manipulates the viewer for example as the characters became more and more dehydrated i started to experience the same symptoms as them clever use of sound and light maybe but highly effective i wouldn't recommend anyone to see this film they might think i was mad but i will say that you will be missing out on something if you don't see this film provocative well directed nicely shot reasonably scripted just about acceptably acted vvg indeed
