need i say more i think i have watched this movie consecutively more times than any other movie i have ever seen it is a piece of cheesy 80's art at its finest the embedded flashbacks make it a bit hard to follow the first 10 times you watch it but make it pleasantly warhol-esque especially once you know the majority of the lines watch it over and over again then watch it some more make sure you watch it with a drink in your hand but remember schwab insurance doesn't insure drinkers br br you could have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life br br are you sure i've got legos you know br br ogilvie cromwell<br br o.c to my friends
