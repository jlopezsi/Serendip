as a film fearless freaks is too long fans of the band probably won't care though as they seem willing to venture however far off the beaten path wayne and the boys want to go i wouldn't recommend it to the casual viewer as it contains way too many scenes of the band's personal lives to be interesting to the general public br br i enjoyed it a lot because it gives lots of insider info on a band that i've loved for over fifteen years the most interesting part and the one that most people will cite as the film's centerpiece concerns steven drozd's frank discussion about his heroin addiction the scene is as chilling as anything you've ever seen watching steven cook up a rig full of smack has to be the wildest thing i've seen in a film in years br br there isn't enough concert footage here but two recent excellent shows are featured coachella 2004 and the stubb's show in austin tx i would have enjoyed more scenes of that classic show in austin tx mainly because i was there in the front and it was the most fun i've ever had at a concert in my life their coachella set i was there too was way too short mostly consisting of wayne trying to surf the crowd in a huge bubble which was totally cool i think they played four songs before they were rushed off so the cure could take forever to come on blah br br the thing i enjoyed most about this film was the insight it gives on what it's like to be a rock star wayne and his wife don't live in a mansion and their lives seem wonderfully normal this was refreshing and it certainly beats the hell out of watching metallica argue for two hours br br the flaming lips have arguably one of the finest albums ever made the soft bulletin if you can find the vinyl version get it no matter how much you got to spend while i don't think this film will open them up to a wider audience fans of the band won't be disappointed
