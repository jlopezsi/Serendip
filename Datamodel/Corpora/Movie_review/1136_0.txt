following the old and sometimes over repeated action/comedy formula the man adds something different to the genre this combination between the action thriller and comedy was done so many times before but not with a personality like eugene levy he truly is the man i mean this guy is unique in the way he represents the dumb guy because he's genuine no offense to the actor but like is said in the film he can't be any dumber than he looks he really represents the dumb guy with simplicity honesty and mostly veracity i think this duet samuel l jackson and eugene levy worked out very well because they are both excellent actors and they represent very well the tough and the dumb guy respectively and the combination of these two character genres played by these actors was amazing at parts it was hilarious the he's my bitch scene is remarkable br br the man is essentially action and fun but it also has one or two nice messages either it's an entertaining film made in hollywood standards but it's a very nice one in the genre
