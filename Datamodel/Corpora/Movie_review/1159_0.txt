this is a bleak dark nasty ugly film of the sort hong kong no longer makes tony leung plays a corrupt cop who is trying to make a peace between two of three powerful crime lords on macau things are going from bad to worse as word hits the street of a contract on one of the crime bosses a tall bald headed fellow is wandering about and seems intent on collecting the cash reward no one knows who is offering worse for leung is the fact that someone seems intent on making his life miserable beginning with a naked dead man in his apartment things only go down hill from there as leung tries to unravel the plot and stay out of increasing trouble br br a fever dream of foul things this was started by one director patrick yau who shot five scenes before hitting a creative brick wall and then was finished by the producers wai ka-fai and johnnie to who stumbled around trying to stitch it together the result is a really violent bloody affair with no hope and no light much of the film operates in a seeming dream logic as it becomes clear that a greater power is operating just beyond leung's view its all comes together in the end but until then its like being trapped in blood soaked nightmare with an occasional severed head i'm kind of at a loss for words this movie operates on a level somewhere underneath the surface and sends out shock waves br br i really like the film but at the same time find it rather disturbing its the sort of bleak rough edged crime drama that hong kong excelled at in the 1980's and 1990's but which it seems to have stopped making br br recommended if you can find yourself a copy and like rough edged mind warping crime dramas
