santa santita is another movie about faith just like those old movies with similar topic himala and ang huling birhen sa lupa the acting is above average the directing is fine the story is just plain while the love scene of angelica and jericho was much hyped there is nothing to arouse the viewers if that is what you are looking for br br the movie got an rare a excellent rating for a review board but was snubbed by viewers too bad it was released on theaters the same week with bcuz of you a badly made movie but a commercial successful flick
