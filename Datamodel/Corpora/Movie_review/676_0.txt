the creature is not a large one at first glance it doesn't even seem to be anything more than an ordinary dog br br but then you look closer the wolf's mouth is larger than that of an ordinary dog the teeth packed more densely together within the wolf's eyes gleam a sickly yellow colour and a vicious snarl augments the drool flowing from its mouth br br the creature leaps at you with supernatural speed and strength its front paws knock you flat on your back and you feel the freezing earth soaking through your shirt the full moon gleaming down like a cruel eye watching you br br the wolf doesn't bother with a killing wound it just begins to tear chunks of flesh from your stomach ignoring your agonized screams it will be a long long time before your body loses all feeling and everything goes dark br br manuel romasanta was a traveling merchant and salesman in the mid eighteen hundreds who at some point went completely and utterly insane he believed himself to be a werewolf a man who would assume the form of an unnaturally large and brutal wolf whenever the moon was full manifesting from this belief was the need to kill and so kill he did some sixteen or more people chosen completely at random no discrimination he would slaughter them devour them and then leave the bodies for others to find br br there have been so many movies made that have been based on the lives of serial killers jack the ripper jeffrey dahmer ted bundy etc it seemed a mere matter of time until they dredged up this psychopath from the history books and immortalized him through film br br but of course being set in the time that it is and under the circumstances through which the events surrounding the case unfolded they couldn't have been content merely to make a slasher/thriller sort of thing documenting the life of a serial killer no they had to turn it into a werewolf movie br br and what a fantastic werewolf movie it turned out to be i was expecting the sorts of cheesy werewolf effects that we saw in such movies as dog soldiers and underworld although to tell you the truth i enjoyed both of those movies solely for the action content in them but groundless were all my fears for as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is not your usual run-of-the-mill type of werewolf crap with romasanta assuming the form of a proper wolf when he transforms rather than dog soldiers it portrays itself more as being along the lines of ginger snaps with much the same sort of tragic tale at the heart of it br br as with seemingly all new-age horror movies even those done in an older sort of style such as this one there is a love story at the heart of the movie however true to the bizarre nature of this movie it is not a happy tale of love that unfolds rather a twisted tragedy in which neither side comes off any better than the other for those of you who possess something like a twisted romanticism i tell you now not to miss this one you'll regret it if you do br br i've already told you basically all you need to know about the story of this movie and i'm not going to ruin all the twists and turns of the movie so as to spoil your viewing enjoyment just be sure not to miss this one especially if you liked ginger snaps
