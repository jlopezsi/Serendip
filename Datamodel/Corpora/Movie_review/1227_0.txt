i'm sorry it may seem like a cute idea but there are a numerous amount of things that bother me about the show first of all i have to agree with one of the earlier comments that the show is just a lame a rip off of jim henson's muppet babies without the funny fantasy segments this especially goes for granny who i used to admire before this show she had quite a personality in the old looney tunes cartoons but here they've turned her into a bland care-giver br br if that isn't bothersome enough all the characters are friends in this show it really makes you wonder what caused them all to be enemies when they grew up and it had to be more than just animal instinct and above all where's porky pig i see petunia on a few occasions but no porky this show is just a crying shame
