this movie was a masterpiece in every way i initially left with a sour taste in my mouth after viewing the ending i then watched the movie again and caught some of the more subtle cues words and actions happening in this movie br br the kubrickian opening scene was beautifully shot and evoked this powerful sense of a journey about to unfold there are several scenes where nicole kidman delivers quite possibly the most powerful performance she has ever delivered and without the use of her voice she pulls this off so well and it gives a good sense of what the rest of her performance has in store an unsung hero in this film is the young child actor cameron bright his performance was equally as astonishing he was able to convey the adult mind intermixed with the mental faculties of a child this mr reincarnation was accurate down to the smallest details of how his actions should be as an adult while also displaying how his vehicle was still that of a child's he was conflicted and equally abound with thought as anna nicole kidman's character the duality was shown towards the end specifically when they were both shown taking portraits br br the musical score by alexandre desplat blends so extremely well with this movie and conveys even more powerfully those scenes where voice is not available to convey each of the actor's unheard emotions the opening shot is one of the best examples of how well it completes the movie br br i believe you'll have to have an observant eye and an open mind to fully appreciate this film the ending may seem unfulfilling or open ended but in a sense it is quite conclusive the ending does leave enough room to view it in different ways however br br in short i recommend this film to those who can fully appreciate films that make you think and which offer a beautiful composition of both music images and story
