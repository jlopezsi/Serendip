the man 2005 samuel l jackson eugene levy luke goss miguel ferrer susie essman anthony mackie horatio sanz dir les mayfield br br tired retread of the buddy flick br br why is the buddy film such a tired vehicle you'd think mixing a comic actor with a dramatic one would be a proved formula since it worked for eddie murphy and nick nolte in 48 hrs which pretty much launched the subgenre of cops and comedy 20 odd years ago well it certainly hasn't aged well and the latest venture of comic and dramatic actors joined at the hip with bullets flying may well signal the death knell for it br br the plot has hapless nice guy schmuck dental equipment salesman andy fidler levy in his trademark character form is in detroit for a convention but winds up gumming up the works inadvertently for a sting operation by undercover atf special agent derrick vann perpetually glowering jackson when fidler unwittingly walks into a diner and sits where vann is supposed to be for a very important meet with an arms dealer who assumes fidler is the man br br when vann abducts the shocked fidler and ingratiating him into the operation at hand well insert the laughter here folks because this is when and why it is supposed to be funny a fish-out-of-water white tight-ass with an angry black street-smart cop team up to get the bad guy are you laughing yet br br the plotting is so tedious and by-the-numbers you beg for the hilarity to ensue already the script by jim piddock levy's co-star in several of the christopher guest mockumentaries of late and margaret oberman and stephen carpenter feels like it is a textbook playbook and mayfield's debut as a director is skeptical at best br br the chemistry between the two seems natural yet in reality very forced fart humor and calling each other a bitch is the high point in this low-concept comedy of errors make a citizen's arrest and don't bother seeing this film anytime soon
