i don't understand the whining about plotholes and other negativity because this is simply a great film with a nice reference to invasion of the body snatcher with donald sutherland in optima forma all the acting was good especially the relatively unknown thal the supporting cast was simply splendid i really enjoyed seeing those familiar faces especially the geek scientist i had seen him as a redneck cop in the client and the black actor from the thing the special effects were also masterfully done considering the modest budget for this film i also loved the story and for those who think it's unoriginal consider it's borrowed from an early robert a heinlein novel br br i wish more sci fi fans would know this movie because it deserves a lot more fame than it got but this way it's a very nice cult hit which has an appeal of it's own i have enjoyed this movie twice and want to see it a 3rd time on dvd even tho it has no extra's it's just a wannahave for my collection br br i give it 9/10 there wasn't simply anything wrong with this movie as far as i could see
