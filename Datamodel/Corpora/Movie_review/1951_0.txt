jaws 3-d 1983 was not only a sequel to the first two jaws films but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-d fad that was sweeping hollywood during the early 80's see amityville 3-d and friday the 13th 3-d when the film hit the video shelves they scrapped the whole thing why make a 3-d movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market the video looked bad when it was released as a rental many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected the movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years no more mainstream films were presented in 3-d the movie itself is pretty bad only for die hard fans of the jaws series br br not recommended unless they re-release it in 3-d other than that it's pretty much worthless
