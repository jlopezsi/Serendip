this is one of those movies that 5 years from now you will see on wtbs in the middle of a rainy saturday afternoon and you will think hum i don't remember that one leelee was good not many strong female parts out in the movie world for young women she made the most of a predictable script and a bad back from the presumed dead villain scene her little brother rhett was played by the same kid that played scott anspaugh for 5 episodes of er they basically had the only two good parts in the movie it is a good diversion from the worlds events and served its purpose to kill 2 hours during tropical storm gabrielle br br leelee will likely win awards in the next 5 years but not for this one
