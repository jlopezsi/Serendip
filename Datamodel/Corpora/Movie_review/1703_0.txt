this film is an effective touching work that is mostly autobiographical yet exaggerated to provide laughs and insight on the difficulties of show business yes it's one of those little guy vs big business tyrant films but it's also very different because in this case it's about a special-effects/animation geek a character which if it has ever been portrayed in film would still be nothing close to this because the man playing the part is a real special-effects designer animator and editor usually this genre of film is reserved for struggling actors or writers this is about the man behind the scenes a person who unlike a director or actor even more so than a writer is rarely if ever on the set of an actual film in watching this film you are constantly reminded that the man responsible for it mike jittlov is someone who truly enjoys what he does and that he's not in it for the money it's based on and around actual shorts he made called demo reels that a special-effects designer/animator/editor/writer such as he would take to various film studios to showcase his talents including the classic the wizard of speed and time how difficult it is to make them and how much harder still it is to get someone to see it jittlov did basically everything in the film he starred in it did his own stunts wrote it directed it edited it did all the special effects and animation wrote the title song financed it and a host of other jobs this is someone who knows what he's doing and knows how to do it well i can't say enough wonderful things about this film so i'll stop now though it may be a bit difficult to find this film if you do you should take the opportunity you'll see the genius of a man who deeply loves his craft and does not take it lightly
