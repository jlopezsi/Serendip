i admit it is not as good as the original looney tunes cartoons not even close but it isn't that bad for one thing the animation is very nice second the theme tune is sweet and memorable third the voice acting is great especially june foray as granny fourth i liked seeing the looney tunes as babies and they are so cute i loved seeing bugs daffy sylvester and tweety however instead of seeing porky elmer and foghorn we see taz and i confess taz isn't a favourite of mine as such not like porky and elmer i know there are some complaints about granny not being the same seeing as in the sylvester and tweety cartoons she is seen hitting sylvester whenever he picks on tweety but somehow i liked her very much here and i seriously cannot see her being mean to those babies she is like a benevolent mother figure i liked that side to her the stories are very predictable though and the dry wit and manic mayhem that made the original looney tunes cartoons so brilliant is missed here in conclusion a good show but not a great one 7/10 bethany cox
