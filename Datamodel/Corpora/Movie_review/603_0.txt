i was blown away by the beauty of the actress playing the indian maiden in this film from the first moment you see her on screen she looks like you could reach out and touch her she is so realistic the d.w griffith years of discovery liner notes say she was unknown well that is a crying shame how could someone not document who she was she was stunning and completely believable if anyone knows who she was please post it here for posterity br br this film was pretty sensitive to the indians cause and also showed that the white man could also get along with the indians when they showed true christian character towards them owen moore and james kirkwood perform well the father's death scene is moving and poignant was d.w griffith a racist if he was you couldn't tell it from this film br br
