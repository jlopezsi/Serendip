let's talk about polarization here a minute this is one of those you either love it or hate it i don't believe that there are too many in the middle it's a tough spot to be in when you are not a teen to successfully understand the current teen crazes and fads let alone the mindset so it's trouble enough trying to capture this successfully when you are a big hollywood mucky-muck like altman there is nothing wrong with writing a teenage comedy drama as an older writer only thing that you will probably experience is the oldisms in that writer's speech old phrases and ideas about life and other stuff some will say yeah but teens are pretty universal but the generations change due to many things there was however cameron crow that set the high-school genre on it's ear with with the creating of fast times at ridgemont high which for me growing up back then was straight between the eyes he hit it dead on no doubt teenaged angst the thought-line and logic that they use etc br br in o.c stiggs this carries a cast of great personalities from the past a few of them are gone now but that is one of the reasons that i loved this now but not when i saw it then how strange but funny it just did it's job over time and grew on me these two are some what organized in their life and pursue ts but bored with some things and upset at others the problems and ideas for solutions that they have are fun and the arizona scenery to me is nostalgic to see then all that has changed from what was a simpler time to be alive the eighties enjoy this 1984 made and 1987 released cult classic
