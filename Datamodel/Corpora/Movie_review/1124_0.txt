when the credits rolled on this one i just sat in sheer amazement amazement that this thing had such terrible writing and direction i can't fault jackson or levy they had to do what they were hired to do i suppose but this movie is atrocious and may be the death knell for buddy movies average premise really good villain and precious little else a complete waste of time jackson had best start picking his projects with more care or his career is going to go into the toilet worse than many direct-to-video productions avoid this like the black plague juvenile attempt at comedy about 3 funny lines overacting by jackson annoying acting by levy i can't begin to say what a complete disappointment this movie was and i'm overwhelmed at all the good comments it's getting here just terrible if nick nolte martin short had played the parts it might have been bearable but maybe not i only know there was no chemistry of any kind between levy jackson
