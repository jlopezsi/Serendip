i read the book long before i heard about the movie and given past history with books being translated into movies i expected netforce to suck but hoped it didn't well it sucks big time i was hoping for something remotely close to the book which it is for about 10 minutes or so until steve day is assassinated then after that it bears no resemblance to the book i was disappointed but based on my expectations not that disappointed 3 out of 10
