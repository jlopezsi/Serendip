i can't imaging how this movie would have been without both bela lugosi and boris karloff probably very very bad the chemistry between the two is amazing br br this is one of those movies in which the story absolutely doesn't matter the story is totally absurd and very simple the black cat storyline has absolutely nothing to do with the movie and serves no purpose at all but yet that is what maybe makes this movie extremely fun and easy to watch br br watching this movie made me realize something bela lugosi actually was a very good actor that was ahead of his time the way he delivers his lines and his eye for details shows that acting was a great passion for him yes i think i can now be considered one of his fans br br another great thing were the sets that were wonderful and even now 70 years later they still look very modern br br don't expect a movie with ghouls and monsters it rather is more fun to watch then it is scary and the lugosi/karloff combination is what makes this movie a real classic br br 7/10
