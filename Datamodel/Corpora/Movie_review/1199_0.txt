once in a blue moon i'll read comments about a film before i watch it i usually don't do this to avoid being influenced the former was the case however prior to my viewing of compelling evidence i felt the need to be more cynical so based on the reviews of it i selected this cinematic masterpiece as the sole celluloid wonder which i had time to see that day i could have picked others but this sounded like the flick to be certain to fulfill my masochistic needs you know to make me shake my head roll my eyes and almost puke and it met these expectations primarily because of the dreadful acting but then danny fendley does that to me i have seen him in other movies and there's just something about his style or his delivery or i don't know what which i'd find better in much smaller doses how bout non-speaking roles also displayed frequently was that tell-tale low-budget audio and the story is so incredible that no cast could salvage it an action star's wife is murdered he's got a mistress then he goes from hating an intrusive reporter to bangin her and maintaining his innocence via her program talk about messed up this takes the cake
