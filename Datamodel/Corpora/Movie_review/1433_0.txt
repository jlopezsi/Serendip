it has a great title but the movie isn't worth the film its made with the plot is awful and the story of a german tank crew trying to get back to its lines is performed just like a spaghetti western i mean with the never ending annoying music and stares of the actors it culminates in a tank battle taking place approximately 50 feet from each tank of course the german tank explodes but both occupants get out unscathed the german tank with the american crew also explodes but no one comes out furthermore the equipment and uniforms are equally ridiculous also the dialogue seems as though it was written by a 10 year old kid do not waste your time with this clunker
