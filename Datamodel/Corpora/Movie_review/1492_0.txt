i was lucky enough to see a preview of this film tonight this was a very cool eerie film well acted especially by skarsgard who played his role of terry glass perfectly sobieski did a very good job too as it seems to me that she has a bright future ahead of her the music was well placed but was fairly standard the use of shadows was quite interesting as well overall this was quite a nice surprise considering i'm not much a fan of this genre 7/10
