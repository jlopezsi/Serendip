the first time i saw this movie i missed the first 30 minutes or so i saw it fully last night and i didn't know the kid's uncle went to prison for 25 years and the same with his mom he could've been an artist and put his talents to good use q-tip adds such sensitivity you can't help but sympathize with his character absolutely uncompromising and downbeat it's no surprise that the director also did several oz series episodes for those with taste in real-drama it's a good watch the ending is heart-wrenching r.i.p elijah<br br click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click
