bette davis is a legend i'd always heard that growing up but felt some disconnect from it when i became aware of her it was late in her career after she had developed into a boozy smoke belching caricature of her on screen persona's so if the bette davis/legend concept rings a little hollow with you as it did me watch this film i just saw jezebel for the first time on dvd wow i haven't seen a lot of movies from the 1930's but i'm pretty sure that no one else was doing then what bette davis was doing it is an acting style and skill level that isn't seen often br br she is brilliant throughout but one scene in particular made the hair stand up on the back of my neck it happens in the scene where henry fonda escorts jezebel home after the ball and breaks off their engagement when he tells her goodbye and not goodnight a look of puzzlement and humiliation comes over her face she starts to turn away to leave but decides instead to extend her hand in southern feminine cordiality to wish him well as she does this something inside her wells up her expression changes and as they say if looks could kill with the speed of a cobra and unable to restrain herself she slaps him in the face unlike a cobra however which recoils after it strikes she lurches slightly closer and you think she might just rip his throat out william wyler lets the camera linger on her and it's a powerful and slightly disturbing moment i don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like davis did br br the film is great although the depictions of slavery as a genteel southern quirk are more than a little cringe worthy to see this movie though is to understand how bette davis became a legend and to see this movie is to see one of the most powerful screen performances ever who knew after all 1938 was a long time ago and i've been busy with other stuff
