1st watched 04/10/2007 7 out of 10(dir-jamie catto duncan bridgeman thought-provoking musical montage covering almost every important subject in life disguised as a full-length music video from artists around the world this movie is packed with ideas but doesn't expect you to buy into any of them it just presents them this is the modern way and this movie has a very modern all-world perspective on life that is refreshing we get to hear from christians jews atheists buddhists and a host of other people from different regions and cultures all over the world between and during the songs in a nice touch we're treated with the names and the places where all the contributors are from at the very end it's nice to match up the names with the faces and hear where they preside from and we get to see how diverse the movie's contributors are this documentary won't make a lot of money because documentaries usually don't but it definitely keeps your interest from the beginning to end for any movie to me keeping your interest is the mark for a good movie and this movie hits that mark
