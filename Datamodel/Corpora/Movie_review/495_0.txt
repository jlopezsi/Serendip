i love the first film the second well as we all know we don't have john belushi with us anymore which is one strike right there the filmmakers made the good choices of john goodman and joe morton as backup singers had they stopped there the film would have been much better br br instead a kid was thrown into the mix an orphan of course awwww elwood blues is supposed to act as mentor for the kid buster but forgets to return buster to the orphanage getting half the cops in the country and several mean orphanage workers on his tail br br now the whole point of the first blues brothers film is that these guys can't stay out of trouble the character of elwood with or without brother jake is going to get himself in it up to his eyeballs the whole story about elwood being chased for kidnapping is ludicrous elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another it didn't have to be kidnapping br br thus we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song one that was belted out by three fine singers aykroyd goodman and morton thus ruining the whole effect it's no wonder that the blues brothers lost the battle of the bands i'd have booed them offstage for bringing a kid into the mix br br there's an cloying aren't-we-cute gushiness about buster and his little blues brothers outfit that almost gags me i loved the musical numbers and all the guest artists and what an impressive group they are so i can't understand why the filmmakers would drag down the storyline by introducing a kid and throwing in all the clich√©s associated with a small child interacting with adults the kid is precocious he's supposedly though i see no evidence of it a good singer he gives a pep talk at the crucial time he's easy to bond with it just doesn't work br br i will watch it for the music and for elwood's highly inventive method of parallel parking but i fast-forward through buster's scenes
