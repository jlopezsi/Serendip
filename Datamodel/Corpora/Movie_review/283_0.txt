i love these little one reel wonders that tcm throws in at the end of their regularly scheduled movies as filler till the next movie comes on i caught this one at the end of sunrise during tcm's 31 days of oscar seems this little 1933 one-reeler was nominated for best short subject br br it's very amusing an early technicolor about a man with indigestion thanks to a wife who's a klutzenheimer in the kitchen una merkel plays the dippy wife she utters about 3 words but is told by the unseen narrator that he's the only one allowed to talk the narrator acts as an omnipotent overseer putting broken eggs and spilled condiments back together again by the magic of reverse-action filming he also brings in a chef in a puff of smoke to come to the housewife's rescue we are then treated to a mini-cooking show with instructions on how to prepare stuffed duck and baked apples it's quite droll with the narrator getting off such funny zingers as br br cook the stuffing for 15 minutes for that perfect taste that you love to burp up later br br now clutch the apple firmly so it will realize the futility of any resistance br br very funny and amusing too bad there's no way to actually know when this will be on again i don't think tcm lists its one-reel wonders in its programming guide which is too bad well if you run across the menu at the end of your regularly scheduled program be sure to stick around and watch it i think you'll enjoy it
