a well made gritty science fiction movie it could be lost among hundreds of other similar movies but it has several strong points to keep it near the top for one the writing and directing is very solid and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci-fi cliches though not all of them it does a good job of keeping you in suspense and the landscape and look of the movie will appeal to sci-fi fans br br if you're looking for a masterpiece this isn't it but if you're looking for good old fashioned post-apoc gritty future in space sci-fi with good suspense and special effects then this is the movie for you thoroughly enjoyable and a good ending br br
