samuel l jackson and eugene levy sounds like a great team can't go wrong not despite the enormous talents of both actors they can't do a thing to save this dull unoriginal buddy cop flick many of the gags fall flat and simply go nowhere for example in one part levy is hungry and wants to get something to eat jackson suggests they get a burger but levy doesn't want to because red meat doesn't agree with his stomach the pay-off to the gag he passes gas in the car god it must've taken hours to come up with that punchline the characters are totally clich√©d and one-dimensional levy's job is to ramble on about banalities while jackson's job is to roll his eyes at him the film does nothing to distinguish itself amongst the buddy-cop genre come on we went from 48 hours to this unfortunately this is levy's first starring role since he became a household name with his role in the american pie films hopefully he'll stumble upon much better roles than this in the future his deadpan comic style is hilarious as we've seen in the ap trilogy but in the man he's forced to be an obnoxious fool levy's talent is more in reacting to awkward situations than creating awkward situations samuel l jackson looks completely embarrassed to be associated with the film he probably took on this role so he can fulfill his contract of 50 movies a year jackson is undoubtedly one of our most talented actors but at the same time not the most choosy with his roles plus in the movie he's forced to play the usual angry black guy character he has played in every other movie so it really is like watching deniro playing a gangster and to top it all off jackson and levy seem to share no chemistry br br the man is yet another lame pg-13 comedy you remember the days when producers couldn't give two s ts about earning the pg-13 rating you don't even have to go that far back look at my cousin vinny now in place of that we have watered down comedies like the legally blonde flicks an r-rating probably wouldn't have made the man a much better comedy but the pg-13 comedy seems to be a epidemic nowadays i think if producers would have the guts to be more edgy and go against the studio's wishes to submit a film with a pg-13 we'd probably have a lot more funny comedies
