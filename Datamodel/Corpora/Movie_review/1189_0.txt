err what messy rubbish a dull one too the storyline starts off interesting well it read more interesting on the back cover on the video case to only succumb to a plodding unimaginative peepshow in outer-space of gratuitous soft-core acts and icky effects what starts off is a collection of stock footage integrated together and we learn that a group of six have been chosen by an alien race to use in a breeding experiment as the earth has been destroyed in a nuclear blast but someone or something on the ship is killing them but still they find enough time to procreate before facing the problems at hand and figuring out just what is happening the way the characters are introduced to us is obviously taken from other films and is quite laughable well that's some nice promotional work even the social commentary card is over-used and too blatant it just made me cringe watch out for the animal rights activist sequence the script is torpidly tepid and convolutely penned with a weak bunch of characterisations and muddled motivations this is where i would say that the clunky story just got in the way of simple fun in its attempt to be clever this roger corman production goes on to present the usual staples found in these quick cash-in bare bones b-features director fred gallo's clumsy execution is just slipshod and repetitive as for the jaunty editing it's complete shambles as many sequences are all over the place and look ridiculous few visuals work and the racy t&a and while you're at it smile as englund has you on candid camera added some much needed spice phoney sets and shoddily crude effects don't damaged it but far from make it any more enjoyable looking at the cast robert englund floats on by with little interest and adam baldwin pretty much does the same thing there is some stunning buxom in kate rodger gretchen palmer and jeannie millar jerry trimble pretty much over-kills it but at least there was someone who wanted to enliven the show his one-on-one combat with an android provided some kinetic zip but his action-character felt rather odd in the mix br br cheap uninteresting sci-fi horror
