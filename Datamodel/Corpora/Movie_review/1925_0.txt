i gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark the shark looked fake the actors looked embalmed even sea world looked stupid i remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to sea world because they had all the props out used in the movie i was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark i saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-d effects this crap was on tv and i feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever i'm waiting for crow and the mst 3000 gang to light into this
