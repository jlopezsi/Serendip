if this quirky british comedy could be summed up in a word that word would be charming br br the story is a simple low-budget british one two orphans scam as many people as they can for as much money as they can in an effort to buy the stately home they always dreamed of as children br br everything is going swimmingly until they join forces with a typist georgie the perfect kate beckinsale and the plot leads on from there br br the acting is perfect for the film neither overstated nor low key and suits the plot and style very well the direction is quirky but makes no new ground and also fits the script to a tee br br this film would be great viewing for a date perhaps not for a lads night in and has the simple comedy you might expect from such classic british tv series as only fools and horses or last of the summer wine br br it doesn't require much brain power but is one of the best homegrown british comedies of recent(ish years
