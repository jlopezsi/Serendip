this movie paints a grim picture of a group of people's lives destroyed by violence i can't say that this movie is a statement on the realities of life because the characters circumstances are so specific that many would have a hard time relating here's a list of the lessons taught in the movie br br 1 don't hit a cop you'll get sent to prison 2 don't shine a laser pointer in a cop's face you'll get sent to prison 3 don't stab a security officer in the neck you'll get sent to prison 4 don't push anyone onto the 3rd rail of a subway station they'll be electrocuted and you'll get sent to prison 5 don't try to escape from prison you will either die trying or get sent back to prison br br i'm not really sure what the overall message of this movie is elijah does everything right by staying out of trouble going to school etc and yet he still gets the shaft 3 out of 10 only because i like q tip
