this is a great movie that was filmed during the summer of 1941 while my family was camping in big bear california i was only 3 years old and have been told about the visit to the sets that my older sisters were able to make they don't recall seeing any stars and think that they visited after the days shooting was completed they were camped in a public campground just down the hill from the houses that were built for the movie i have been told that i sang the frank sinatra hit i'll never smile again at the age of 3 for all of the campers at the nightly campfire gathering i memorized songs i've been told from the radio that my sisters always were playing this was the last camping done until after ww 2 since pearl harbor was attacked in decemeber of that year the opening scene of the movie is of big bear lake and the later scenes around the small lake where they fished is at a small man-made lake that was formed for the movie i assume that the inside scenes were filmed in hollywood but all of the outdoor scenes were filmed on the crest of the mountains to the south of big bear lake the san bernardino valley is beyond some of the distant mountains as they filmed on the top of the crest the rocks are prominent in the san bernardino mountains and used throughout the film the south shore of big bear lake has large boulders at the water's edge but this area is not use in the movie anyway it is great because of the newness of john wayne and his now famous facial antics which we love and harry carey who was john wayne's idol in real life betty fields always great shines in the part of sammy this movie is now available as an econimical set of john wayne dvd's that just became available it is the best of the movies in the set but all of the others are wonderful just because they feature john wayne my wife and i enjoyed seven sinners which we had never seen
