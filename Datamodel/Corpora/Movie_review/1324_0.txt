this movie is visually stunning each shot is framed like a still made by a master photographer it is among the most beautifully filmed works i've ever seen br br the wonderful music is spontaneous and part of the fabric of life and death of the story this is not a musical like hair or chicago or sound of music i don't mean to demean vengo when i say it's use of music is more like that in forrest gump or almost famous where music sets the mood or anchors us in a time and place as the story flows if you like world music or flaminco you will love this movie if you didn't when you started watching you will by the end br br i figured out most of the story even though i don't speak much spanish i wonder why if my tv can put spanish language closed-caption subtitles under english moves why i can't get english language captions in spanish movies wish someone would make an english language version of this wonderful film br br loved it 9 out of 10 stars
