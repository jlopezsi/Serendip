magnificent warriors is an enjoyable and entertaining movie with a lot to recommend it especially the excellent athletic prescence of the fantastic michelle yeoh still it drags and feels a little limp in places for instance the two opening fights during the plot setup are explosive impactful and a lot of fun but after that nothing really happens action-wise until 20 minutes later br br the film stop-starts all the way through making it a bit frustrating for an experienced viewer it's no more stop-starty or inconsistent than us or european action fare like transporter or red siren but it seems patchy and messy in comparison to other hong-kong adrenaline-rides like full contact or yeoh's later wing chun both movies keep a consistent level of action without sacrificing their story lines br br they also have strong non-wacky story lines magnificent warriors is a horrific mess in the plot department take indiana jones substitute the japanese for the nazis and substitute michelle yeoh for harrison ford and you'd think it'd rock you'd almost be right but the director and his writers decided to try and make some political points with it and turn it into a patriotic pro-china movie as such it gets kind of messy and biased br br still it's a michelle yeoh film if you're a fan which i most certainly am you won't be disappointed with this yeah ok mw blows its two best fights in the first 20 minutes but there's a lot of good solid action going on here and though yeoh isn't as central as i would have liked to preceedings given she's the only one here who can act her way out of a paper bag she has some fantastic set pieces and humorous lines to fight/charm her way through br br if you like michelle yeoh watch this it's a good film and above all it's fun and she showcases both her fighting talent and her charm in equal measure if you're indifferent to her and just want an ott blast there are much better hk actioners out there you'd probably fare better with say eastern condors or full contact both of which are off their rocker and full of chop-socky and gun-play
