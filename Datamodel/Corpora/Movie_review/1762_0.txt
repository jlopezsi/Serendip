i have to grant at the start that this game is quite different from the other final fantasys that i've played all but 5 every game goes through an evolution and this is the case with this one one of my favorite changes is the salary system many people complain but be honest how many dragons or mechanical weapons carry a pouch of gold or gil i mean really where would they put it how are they going to spend it this makes no sense plus with the characters actually having an occupation they should get paid for doing their job they are mercenaries mercenaries get paid simple i think it is a refreshing change br br it would be pretty hard to dispute the fact that the graphics are beautiful they are the cg scenes are the most incredible i've ever seen br br i'm a guy but somewhat of a romantic at heart so i was overjoyed when i learned that this was going to be a love story the sole problem is i don't like the girl in the love story she bugs me squall on the other hand i can accept he's a cold bastard at times but seems to undergo a lot of development and if you think about it he's only 17 so is everyone else except the adults edea and cid br br i do have problems with the magic system i like the junctioning of summoned monsters or espers or gf whatever but the magic thing bugs me personally i'd prefer to go back to ffvi where you learn spells from the esper br br everything is an experiment and i'd get tired of playing the exact same game over and over so i like the changes and i love the card game this is the single coolest side quest in a game ever br br to sum up i love this game it is a worthy addition to the final fantasy family and i'm looking forward to conquering it on disc 4 now
