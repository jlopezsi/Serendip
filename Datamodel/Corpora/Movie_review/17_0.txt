i've been reading the comments and i'm not surprised that others find this movie boring it's not for anyone with a limited attention span i don't have one of those and i thought this was a very interesting if not somewhat sad look at the world of employment whether it be temp or permanent i guess everyone wants to fit in-whether it be your job or school if you can find some little niche that you do belong in enjoy it because sometimes that fit never lasts i think that's what happened in this movie the 4 main characters fit in with each other because they were temps and had that little thing in common but what else they had in common is not clear and i think it wasn't enough to hold the little group together sure we can blame it on the thief plot but in the long run relationships like that don't last because they have very little in common as for the new girl cleo i actually felt sorry for her-she was such a lonely soul and it seemed she tried to make friends with those 4 but they didn't want to include her in she paid iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps she stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.i can really feel for the cleo character the four main characters are a case study in themselves but they were a hoot and so much like those that i've come across in life and that's why i like this movie-the characters are real
