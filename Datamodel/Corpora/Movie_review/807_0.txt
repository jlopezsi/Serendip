i knew who charles nelson reilly was from the old game shows on tv when i was a kid this movie is pretty much a film of his stage act i didn't know he had one the guy lived an incredible life and if he were to read this he would stress that he still is living an incredible life this is a great stage act brought to the screen and it has a real neat feel to it the camera angles and editing add to this man's story telling it is a very unique movie and i can't recommend it enough i saw it down at the swx film festival and everybody was raving about it i think you walk into the movie with low expectations who really wants to see an older man from cheesy game shows in a one-man stage show talk about his life but the movie grabs you
