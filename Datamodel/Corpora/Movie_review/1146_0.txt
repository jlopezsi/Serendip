the man is one of what i like to call mwlp movies with little plot the movie's plot is rather thin jackson is a cop whose partner was just killed by a gun-smuggling ring he sets up a buy with a dealer but a case of coincidence leads levy to intercept the goods now that the dealers think levy is the buyer jackson has no choice but to work with levy to bust the ring br br like i said the plot if mediocre but the movie itself is good jackson walks the walks and levy talks talks and talks the cursing swearing tough-as-nails cop paired with a dental supply salesman who really just wants to get the job over with and go on with his life preferably before jackson shoots him in the keyster again but in the end jackson must swallow his pride as levy takes matters into his own hands and sets up a trade to get jackson into the heart of the operation not bad for a dental supply salesman br br over all if you want an engaging twisting turning and suspenseful look elsewhere you want laughs and one of the most outrageous cop pairings since chris tucker and jackie chan see this movie
