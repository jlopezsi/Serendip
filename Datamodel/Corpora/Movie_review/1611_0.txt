this is a b movie about an ex-con trying to go straight but forced by his former cronies to participate in a bank robbery it has a nice film-noir look but the script is quite routine and predictable while it's worth watching there is nothing compelling or memorable about it hayden sleep-walks through his role of a tough-talking world-weary police captain who suspects ex-con nelson is involved in a series of holdups in one of his earliest credited roles albeit as buchinsky bronson plays one of the heavies while kirk plays nelson's concerned wife everybody in this film is tough and hard-boiled and the performances are all wooden
