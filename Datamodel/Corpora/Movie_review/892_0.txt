no this is not another pearl harbor epic though it comes as almost as big a surprise this is in fact the show that i hoped fat actress and the comeback might be and deserves equal footing with entourage it's often laugh-out-loud funny mixing sophisticated sarcasm with broad physical comedy who knew tori spelling could be an accomplished comic actor with a major gift for impeccable timing and dead-pan delivery actually i've seen her do dead-pan delivery before but never to such great and intentional comic effect that she can even participate in such a dead-on send up of her industry in general and her self and her family in particular earns her great noisy props
