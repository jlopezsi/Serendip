sterling hayden gene nelson phyllis kirk and charles buchinsky bronson stars in this relatively forgotten but excellent film that centers on the life of an ex-con nelson who's trying to go straight after mixing with the wrong crowd some of his ex-friends are creating a crime wave of robberies and need someplace to hide out and when they find him he tries to tell them to get out the movie is very adult and in your face with its no-holds-barred attitude and makes the viewer feel as if it could be happening today br br sterling hayden is absolutely great and thoroughly convincing as a cop who's gotten burnt out and treats all cons as scum and believes once a thief and gene nelson is good too who incidentally looks great here i had never really noticed him much in oklahoma but here wow and there is a neat little twist to it at the very end that you don't see coming if you're a lover of film noir then buy this on dvd today in a classic film noir set 4 and watch the whole set and start your own wave
