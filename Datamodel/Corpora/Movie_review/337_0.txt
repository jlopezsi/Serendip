this series mini is hands down the best show ever on tv i loved winds of war war and remembrance thorn birds etc but none can match this one i have watched season one and two twice on dvd and season three over twice as it shows in hd i did not watch this when it started as it seemed to be vulgar and violent in the first few episodes in the bits and pieces i saw then in june 2006 i rented two disks from season one and i was hooked i searched near and far to rent the shows and then ordered the dvds br br by the 4th episode you are part of the story and even starting to love the bad guys i do believe if a wider audience could have been exposed to this show it would be recognized for the unparalleled cinema it is i can not imagine many of the actors being able to top this i recommend investing in the dvds as it will be something to watch every year or so as it is an experience not a show
