i don't always like comedy and horror mixed but this one did make me laugh hard and i liked the story.it had some really good kills and some hysterical original humour.the whole revenge storyline is old but a good and effective one.it reminded me a lot of nightmare on elm street how a bunch of parents killed a guy and he comes back from the dead to exact revenge on the kids of the parents.of course nightmare on elm street was more of a horror.i hated the first scene of drive-thru.i cannot stand it when white kids act and talk like they're black,especially the well educated ones.watching the way they were acting and talking made me cringe i anticipated all those whiggers dying brutally and they did it's sad how brainwashed a lot of youth are these days.it's time for a rock revival and to say goodbye to rap i liked the soundtrack for this movie.the theme song sung by leighton meester was cool and i liked the other version playing during the end credits.if there was a soundtrack sold in stores i would buy it this movie would have made a good theatrical summer movie we need a new demonic serial killer to hit the big screen jason,freddy,and the others have all been over used not that i want their evil legacy's to end(especially chucky my favorite but it's time for a new one and archie had potential.with a bigger budget and more advertising it could have easily made it's theatrical debut.a bigger budget sequel would be nice.if there is plans to do one i would like to see the survivors all brought back to face the demonic horny clown again
