i saw this first years ago when i was kid around the time it came out my dad loved it and we had it on tape it was then lost in the streams of time and i totally forgot about it about a year ago my sister and her husband while i was over visiting pulled a video out of their shelf and asked if i'd ever seen this it was the wizard of speed and time and i said that it looked familiar from about 10 seconds in i remembered this movie competely and was filled with merriment in the way people get when you see something again that you loved as a kid and is still as good br br jittlov wrote directed produced audited gripped funded cranked cameraed composed googled flamboozed and starred in this almost one-man show he's extremely talented in all respects the movie is extremely cleverly written well acted well directed and amusing to the point of extremes very clever shots are taken to many different facets of hollywood as mike tries to complete a movie he's making the ending is witty the romance is credible and this movie is just plain fun it even has good music definately high on my list of all time goodies i did get a bit sick of it after watching it about 30 times or so but very few movies keep my attention that long a warning though you really have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy this movie most people i tried to get to watch it didn't enjoy it let's face it mike is a nerd getting all the chicks and stands up for nerds everywhere you kinda have to be a nerd to enjoy this movie and i am a nerd 9/10
