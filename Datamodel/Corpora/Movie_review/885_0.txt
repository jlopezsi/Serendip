this film is highly reminiscent of another film la terra trema both might be considered italian neo-realist films though la grand strada azzura does feature a big-name actor in the lead yves montand and a big budget somethings that a neo-realist film cannot have to be technically this type of film however i am apparently one of the few reviewers on imdb that really disliked la terra trema because the acting was so incredibly amateurish as well as the lousy camera-work instead la grand strada is beautifully filmed in color and montand is the centerpiece around which all the non-professional actors are anchored br br the film itself is also a little more exciting because it deals not just with a family of fishermen like the other film but a family that illegally uses homemade dynamite to fish and the negative impact on the fishing industry and the other fishermen makes for some great tension while this certainly isn't a great film it's a very very good one and has an excellent ending to wrap it all together br br by the way do not get the idea that i dislike neo-realist films and prefer big-name actors and budgets no i actually love movies such as umberto d miracle in milan and the children are watching us all by vittorio de sica it's just that there are also a couple truly awful and amateurishly made neo-realist films as well that i really hate and apart from stomboli la terra trema is probably the most boring and unwatchable neo-realist film i have seen you are much better off just watching this film it's very similar but interesting and avoid la terra trema unless you are a masochist and you actually like very slow and miserable films
