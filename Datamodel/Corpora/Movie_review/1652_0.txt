watching shakespeare without dialog isn't as challenging as you might think indeed this 1912 film manages to condense the play neatly and still retains much of the power of the piece without hearing or even reading the words much of the success of richard iii is due to the vivid characterization by frederick warde but his costars are excellent too the direction is basic of course and every so often director-star james keane wastes precious time what's up with that long semi-tracking shot of the ship but generally his work is more than adequate comparing keane's work here to the pioneering 1911 italian feature l'inferno it's clear that the american did have knowledge of what was going on elsewhere even if he of course fell far short of what d.w griffith was already doing overall richard iii will be of considerable interest to silent-film fans as well as stage performers interested in viewing the work of 19th century master warde otherwise i doubt this movie will thrill many other viewers but i could be wrong check it out for yourself
