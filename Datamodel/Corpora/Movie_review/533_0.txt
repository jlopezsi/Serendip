br br the hole ironically named after its major weakness holes in the plot seems to move from flash back to reality a little to frantically for me some parts seem rushed and it could of done with more interaction within the hole itself the acting is hit n miss birch isn't great and her accent tends to wander off to australia south africa and back to her native country although the rest of the cast seem competent i was specially impressed by kiera knightley as the slutty teen queen this a refreshing film and an indication that school influenced comdies/dramas/thrillers can be effectively implemented in england the u.s bubble gum high school nausea is waring thin in the states and these kind of films have found a fresh ground u.k in the hole our cultural and class history doesn't have to be spelt out like the jock,geek,stoner bland recycled crap that floats to the surfaces regularly<br br good 7/10
