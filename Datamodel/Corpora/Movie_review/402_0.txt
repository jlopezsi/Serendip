though this is not the most thrilling ride tower of terror and rockin rollar coaster are much better for thrills)star tours is fun it's a ride simulator or something like that it's mild thrill so everyone can enjoy it even the little 4-year-olds don't get a fast pass the attraction is just as enjoyable at the line as the actual ride c-3po and r2-d2 make a special appearance in the line arguing as usual now the ride you're a passenger on a starspeeder which is taking you to endor your pilot rex is a first-time pilot and messes up by taking the wrong turn you fly through a hanger and after much confusion leave you enter hyperspace but fly past endor great you end up flying through a comet breaking through ice you exit the comet and what do know star destroyers you end up being a part of the battle that's going on between the rebellion and the empire you go through the death star trench scene(except luke is not blowing up the death star you finally make it to a star tours station but not without almost crashing you then leave and get to a souvenirs shop they have anything you can think of there now star tours is a little outdated but it's still enjoyable when i first went on it i was 8 hated star wars and loved the ride that's how fun it is you don't have to be a fun of the saga to enjoy it it's not something to pass by at disney
