this is a children's movie is it a great children's movie no br br but it is an enjoyable children's movie sure gamera looks like he was constructed at the last second out of an old shopping bag and monster x looks like something that you pulled out of a salvation army drop-box but this movie has children as the main characters doing the bulk of the heroics and making the bulk of the sound decisions br br there are a tremendous number of plot-holes in this movie but if you've got children and a little patience you can enjoy ninety minutes of pig-headed adults brave children and flying turtles br br also there is a certain resemblance to the science fiction novel blameless in abaddon anyone else notice
