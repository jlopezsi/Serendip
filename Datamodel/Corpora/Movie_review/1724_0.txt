i saw this movie at a film festival before it was released to the general public and poor nicole kidman got boo-ed by a lot of the people who had come to see the movie br br i eventually went to see it again when it was finally released to the general public br br i can't believe how uptight americans can be about anything and everything involving sex and sexual situations what are their hang-ups about such things br br people were too worried about the movie appearing to condone child pornography instead of watching the movie for what it was actually about a movie about death mourning and re-incarnation br br since i practice budism i was glad to see the issue of re-incarnation brought up in such a mainstream movie the story is very gripping and holds you to the edge of the seat the entire time br br i also liked the fact that there is very little dialogue in the movie sometimes too many words and unnecessary conversations can get in the way of a great story
