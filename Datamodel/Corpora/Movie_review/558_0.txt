wow it's interesting to see the variety of reviews of this film the ones who liked it must have been drugged or related to the filmmakers this movie had good actors and apparently a large budget but the script sucked nothing about the story made any sense absolute garbage the only redeeming thing about this movie besides the fact that i watched it for free is the wigger wannabes get killed immediately in the beginning the kills were very imaginative and could have worked well had the script made sense my advice to the directors would be hone your directing skills and leave the writing to the professionals don't waste your time on this one
