the movie the emerald forest was a fictional story that was based on a true story boorman based his movie of a article that appeared in the los angeles time in the early 1980's which talked about a father whose son was abducted by native tribes and rediscovered ten years later this may be a true story although there are critics out there who claim that the man made up the story because he wanted attention the emerald forest was a very good film the emerald forest was the first film to bring up the issue of the destruction of the amazon the locations are picturesque and boorman is able to capture the cultural authenticity of the native tribes of the amazon what really surprised me was that boorman did not use actors but went deep into the jungles of brazil to find real natives to give his a film an authentic feel this was especially true regarding the invisible people who boorman portrayed as a mysterious and elusive tribe which is demonstrated when they are camouflaged in the jungle and manage to stroke tommy's face with a feather undetected by his family who are only a few feet a away from the invisible people that being said although boorman did capture the authenticity of the native tribes and address the issue of deforestation the storyline was a little dull and clich this movie contains all the clich√©s that other movies have where a white man meets the natives the first major clich we can see in the movie is when the white men come they bring with them guns and alcohol and of course they exploit the natives another clich is that as the white men come and development and progress disturbs the native's way of living as well as destroy the rainforest the final clich which we see in a lot of movies where natives play a predominant role is that the native lifestyle is portrayed as a sanctuary that sin has never entered i still believe the film was good and i understand for the most part that is really what happens but boorman could have made the film a bit more interesting and different and still portray his message the preservation of the rainforest can easily be identified as the overriding and most obvious theme portrayed in this movie the concern for maintaining the rainforest is demonstrated through the presumed wisdom we are called to see in the american indian elders however bill markham is blind to this wisdom until the end of the movie a few statistics are also thrown around in the movie concerning the role the amazon plays in the world and how the white man is destroying it all by bringing industry to the area the statistics are thrown around in a subtle way for markham to realize the implications and damage he has caused by building the damn showing them as being far greater and vaster than he had expected it was powerful to hear the reporter say that 40 percent of the world's oxygen supply is generated by the rain forests and watch markham dismiss him because of his ignorance to the real issue also the movie goes on to assert that 5,000 acres of amazonian rainforest is disappearing every day this is actually generous once markham realizes the vastness of the problem the tables had already been turned on him he too is kidnapped and is rescued by his son tomme this scene was powerful because it shows that the boy had actually become loyal to his kidnappers and what they stand for not the white man plight for development and industrialization through all of bill's begging and pleading he wouldn't return back to civilization with his biological father what does it reveal to his bill he finally understands the destruction of life he had contributed to over the past 10 years and tries to undo his wrong by letting a violent thunderstorm destroy the dam they built
