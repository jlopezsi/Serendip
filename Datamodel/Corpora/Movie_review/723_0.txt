a complete comedy farce robert de niro and billy crystal are both great fun and so is joe viterelli as de niro's hilarious security guard jelly it is amusing nothing is wrong with the film accept its language no one should complain about its content its content is meant to be funny when mobster paul vitti(de niro is suffering anxiety attacks for some odd reason he sees a shrink named ben sobel(crystal to solve his tragedys and ways to move through the mob the idea is small and it stretches out too far but its still great fun to me this is de niro's best comic performance of all the most hilarious part in the film has to be where crystal is in the church getting hugged by a stranger an 8.3/10
