i don't even know where to start i don't want to tell you much about this film because i don't want to spoil it for you by giving you account of the funny scenes moreover that would be quite impossible anyway as the film is simply funny all the way through sure i have my favourite scenes one in particular which make me laugh just thinking about them seriously this is a comedy with a great story and many laughs as a matter of fact i really laughed all the way through from start to finish br br i want to recommend you to lighten up and simply relax when you decide to watch it let go of any expectations or judgements simply watch and let the movie entertain you it might seem as an obvious thing to do but it is easy to slip into that judgemental and critical feeling however subtle it might be which will spoil any movie for you not just this one br br i highly recommend this movie if you want to lift you spirit up for whatever reason as this movie will do it for you it is my favourite and i do hope that it will be your favourite too
