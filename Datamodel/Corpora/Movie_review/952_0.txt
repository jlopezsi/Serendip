there's something wrong about dropping an american con-artist into london but somehow here it works there are lots of potential reasons not to like this film but most of them don't seem to really matter it just works anyway br br maybe it's because this was the first time i ever saw kate beckinsale and i was just stunned br br anyway i was hugely amused when i heard that there was a boycott organized against this film by some people who thought it was going to be about someone shooting at fish bang bang poor fishies no of course it's no such thing br br if you haven't seen this then i can pretty much guarantee that you will not waste your time if the opportunity comes up
