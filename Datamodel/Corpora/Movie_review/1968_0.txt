oh how i would love to see this picture again i saw it on tv i guess around the time it was made and have never seen it since i wonder if it even still exists i remember it as being fantastically eerie and the primate members of the cast were magnificent some other reviewers have pointed out that the movie was called a cold night's death when they saw it that was also the case as far as i was concerned perhaps that was just the uk title if anyone who reads this knows if it exists even on vhs i'd love to know about it i've given it a 9 because that's what i would have given it at the time if only i could see it again through more adult and educated eyes maybe one day
