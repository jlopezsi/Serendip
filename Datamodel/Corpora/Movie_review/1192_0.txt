wow this movie was bad now the acting was decent enough but its clear the actors had little to work with they tried to save this stink-bomb but there really was no hope the story was flimsier than rice paper and the special effects shots were mostly stolen many from battle beyond the stars the ship was apparently made of card board and the technology was primitive enough that humans who had never seen the systems could take control and hack the computer pathetic i've seen fan-made films that were far superior in writing and effects the only reason i gave this move a 3 is that it makes a good mst3k flick get some friends get some booze and enjoy heckling it between the few t&a scenes
