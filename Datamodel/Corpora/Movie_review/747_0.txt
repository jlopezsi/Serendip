this is also one of my favorite movies along with dances with wolves and last of the mohicans it makes me sigh to think of the beautiful native civilization where people live in harmony with nature it really points out how messed up things are in our civilization the native scenes are gorgeous both in the scenery and in the relationships portrayed definitely a worthy film
