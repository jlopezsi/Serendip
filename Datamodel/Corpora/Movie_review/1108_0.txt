whether or not you agree with the political views of george mcgovern or those espoused by the talented director of this film stephen vittoria this film should be mandatory viewing for all americans the old saying is true in order to know our future we must know our past this film shines a bright light on the life of george mcgovern and his failed attempt to win the 1972 presidential election br br not necessarily a household name for today's generation mcgovern represented the idealism of american politics and it's fair to say we haven't seen anyone like him since br br mcgovern's victory in the democratic primary was nothing short of astonishing a senator from south dakota running against 16 other candidates for the democtratic nomination he amazingly won and set off to battle against nixon in the presidential election after a series of unfortunate events the shooting of george wallace and self-described campaign errors nixon won in a landslide br br the film uses archival footage interviews with political historians influential political activities from the time period e.g dick gregory gloria steinam warren beatty gary hart and candid interviews with senator mcgovern blended with an excellent musical score the film is not to be taken lightly br br with obvious parallels between nixon and today's bush administration it's hard not to get wrapped up in the idealism of what if had mcgovern won the election br br senator mcgovern is a spry 83 years old at the time of this review with an intellect as sharp as ever on the sad day when he passes this film will serve as a tribute to his idealism and accomplishments during one of the blackest hours of american history br br here's hoping the film will indeed be used as a teaching tool in high schools and colleges around the country br br ebhp
