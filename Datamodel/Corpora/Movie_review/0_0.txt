i admit the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me of the dozen or so major silents i have viewed one i loved the crowd and two were very good the last command and city lights that latter chaplin circa 1931 br br so i was apprehensive about this one and humor is often difficult to appreciate uh enjoy decades later i did like the lead actors but thought little of the film br br one intriguing sequence early on the guys are supposed to get de-loused and for about three minutes fully dressed do some schtick in the background perhaps three dozen men pass by all naked white and black wwi and for most their butts part or full backside are shown was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of howard hughes
