gosh golly marlowe i surely do love this film all right so it's another tidbit of trashy 80s post-apocalyptic fluff but it's really the cream of the crop and has a great soundtrack fun sets and costumes tongue-in-cheek writing and acting cannibalism swing dancing love innocence mayhem violence and plenty of silly 50s references philip and marlowe ha ha leave the bomb shelter after basically their whole entire lives and emerge into a radioactive wasteland to search for their fathers this ranks right up there with rockula bill and ted and pretty in pink as the cutest 80s kitsch films okay so maybe i'm a little hung up on raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and that whole genre so i enjoyed this a little more than someone who didn't grow up in the 80s and who never saw the big sleep more than 20 times but i still recommend this as rollicking fun for everyone who loves mutant new wave girlies on motorcycles etc
