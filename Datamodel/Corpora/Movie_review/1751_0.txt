i am probably one of the few people who did not immediately dislike this often dogged game i found the draw/junction system to be fascinating and mightily enjoyed the story once it got going i can see where some may have problem with this i know i do but it is a true example of the designers inventive nature that they even dared to make it in such a manner the music is much more complete than in the previous game the design of everything is much more realistic which fits the style the game is trying to achieve the cinemas are among the best in all of gaming not just for the technical boundaries they push but for the artistry involved this may have been the first game where i could feel a directors presence and it enchanted me hats off to square
