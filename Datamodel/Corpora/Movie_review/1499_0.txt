movies this bad tend to kill a lot of actors careers or at least push them out of the spotlight for a while i think when you're an actor and sign onto scripts so clich and void of creativity it reflects poorly upon you as a performer and what you can bring to a performance in future productions br br i used to work at a blockbuster and can't get over how often the papers tv shoes and people on the internet carry on about how good a movie was that meanwhile literally over a hundred customers will come in frowning over this was one of those movies br br predictable unintelligent arrogant slow and just a waste of our time and money it's everything a thriller shouldn't be at point are you held in suspense or questioning what will happen next while the opposition of the internet always brings about the dogs of the industry that won't tolerate any ill words towards the industry people of the real world are generally on the same page and this is one of those movies absolutely terrible
