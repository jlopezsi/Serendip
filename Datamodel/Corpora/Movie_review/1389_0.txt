stagy tedious wooden boring endless and yet br br here's a cast of wonderful mgm actors in their prime joan crawford is not that far removed from the musicals of her youth her beauty hasn't hardened into the horrible kabuki mask of later years she's one of the worst things about this movie she's utterly unfunny and totally charmless she sinks every scene to the bottom of the sea and thence downward to the center of the earth still it's always interesting to watch her to notice the lighting and other tricks that give her the star treatment in every shot br br the male leads are the incomparable william powell one year after my man godfrey and robert montgomery one year before night must fall br br the rest of the cast is filled out with wonderful character actors including frank morgan nigel bruce and melville cooper not to mention jessie ralph a cinema immortal for her role as mrs hermosillo brunch in the bank dick br br in 1937 american actors were severely afflicted with the phony english accent syndrome cahnt for can't here the cast is supposed to be mostly english with only crawford and powell as visiting americans but crawford and powell both speak in that mid-atlantic half english accent meanwhile half the english characters are played by americans who barely attempt to sound english robert montgomery frank morgan jessie ralph in these bewildering accents much dialog is babbled little of it worth hearing br br but under the wreckage you can discern the movie somebody was hoping to make something like the infinitely better trouble in paradise ernst lubitsch's masterpiece about two jewel thieves their victim and the resulting love triangle samson raphaelson the brilliant writer of trouble in paradise is one of the many listed writers on this movie there are a few flashes of brilliant dialog here that sound like him meanwhile frank morgan later the wizard of oz plays a character that's a prototype for mr matuschek in the wonderful lubitsch/raphaelson shop around the corner br br but in this movie 90 of the dialog is heavy as lead there are many frenzied comings and goings none of them funny in no way is this movie a comedy if by comedy we mean what makes you laugh number of intentional laughs detected in this film 0 unintentional laughs few this isn't even one of those so bad it's good movies it's just a stinker br br and yet all those actors near the tops of their careers a first-class mgm production from the golden age and mrs hermosillo brunch my advice tivo it and watch it at triple speed if you like but do take a gander
