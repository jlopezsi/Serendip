i saw pieces that were incorporated into the film on a walt disney telecast titled the possible impossible or something of that sort it was mike jitlov's marching tripods and biting clapper slates walt was the host of the show and he explained that by using movie techniques it was possible to present things that couldn't really happen br br having had to improvise some low-cost special effects for an industrial film i did in the early 1970s i sympathize with anyone who has limited cash and great ambition mr jitlov has done outstanding visual work in the film-within-the-film and some excellent work in the rest of the opus br br a version of the short piece was shown at a new england science fiction society convention i was attending so i got another glimpse of the picture when the final later version of the film was released i realized it's a one-of-a-kind film br br the feature is entertaining and carries the viewer along with the story which is full of hollywood in-jokes even if you know nothing about the world of film the movie still entertains br br although the gentle story carries the viewer along the real feature is the vast number of special effects scenes throughout the opus they are sociometric eye candy worth repeated viewings br br worth watching worth tracking down to watch
