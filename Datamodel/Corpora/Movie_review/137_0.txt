one of the hallmarks of a good european film is that it gets to be re-made in hollywood director/producer/writer luc besson has received this dubious honour twice firstly with a remake of nikita and more recently with one of taxi br br i can't comment on the american version of taxi but the remake of nikita known as point of no return or the assassin isn't a patch on the original br br nikita made me feel sympathy for the central characters to the extent that i was almost in tears at times the story is a simple one of love and longing to be free interspersed with besson's trademark economical-yet-bloody action scenes br br nikita proves that there is more to cinema than hollywood
