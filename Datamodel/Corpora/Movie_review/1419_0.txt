the phone is dead do you hear that vitus even the phone is dead what a great line br br this is one of my favorite horror movies of all time bela lugosi and boris karloff playing chess and fighting it out over old wounds and new ones br br the entire supporting cast is splendid as is the direction edgar g ulmer yet could we expect less from a story loosely adapted as it was by edgar allan poe and this cast see for yourself and i'm sure you won't be disappointed br br many aspects of this film remind me of old dark house and i like it just as much if you know me you would realize what a ringing endorsement that truly is br br i think you'll be refreshingly surprised at lugosi playing the sympathetic character even though it's not entirely clear early on in the movie br br one of the scenes that has always stood out in my mind since first watching this film is the one near the end when lugosi ties up karloff there is no blood and yet it is more gruesome than many of today's graphic moments it goes to show that there is more to great horror than having to show every detail br br keep an eye out for the title of the book karloff reads in bed very creepy stuff br br i rate this movie a 9 in the category of horror classics to me it's not frankenstein or dracula but not that far below br br
