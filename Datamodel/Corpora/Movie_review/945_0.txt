i think i have to stop watching english movies apart from the james bond-movies and a small number of comedies they are usually pure crap this movie is definitely one of those the first ten minutes starts out ok and the movie has potential at this time sadly it doesn't continue in this style at all the story is about two swindlers who tries to earn a lot of money by tricking people in different ways none of the ways they do this are funny at all it's supposed to be a comedy but personally i didn't laugh one single time during the movie in addition the story really sucks especially because they threw a bit of romance on top of it alos the ending is very bad and it was just what i had expected because movies like this leave you with no surprises if you want to see a movie about swindlers watch dirty rotten scoundrels instead
