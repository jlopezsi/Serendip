the shark looked totally fake especially right before it crashed into the glass window under water the film characters and dialogue were boring and uninteresting but no matter how bad it got i still liked the under water kindom idea and when the shark was swimming around it and scaring all the people a particularly funny(that's right funny part was when the shark trapped a group of people and they were all moaning and crying jaws was good jaws 2 was somewhere between horrible painful movie and ok movie but closer to horrible painful movie this was ok as for jaws 4 let's not even go there
