i actually owned this on video for three years before watching it somehow i just didn't get around to it what was i thinking i read some reviews of it most were either mediocre or sneering and i thought the work would be a lame shot on video cbc doc with some talking heads explaining duh why they think kurt weill is a musical genius br br then i watched this film and wow first of all it's not a documentary it's a concert film with amazing renditions of weill's music by luminaries such as nick cave william s burroughs lou reed mary margaret o'hara david johansson elvis costello and p.j harvey amongst others doing incredible interpretations of weill's work br br the film is interestingly staged in an old warehouse that evokes both the early industrial period in which weill worked as well as the alienation technique of brecht's theatre br br i can't describe how wonderful this work is if you are a brecht purist you may find this a little too awesome but if you have an open mind and enjoy challenging and inventive music you must see this br br what struck me so powerfully was that weill's music never fit into what anybody would mistake as a musical or opera or pop but amalgamated them all in an attempt to bridge art with the politics that surrounded him at the time weill's music was the soundtrack to the rise of nazism in europe and his haunting scores are even more disturbing in retrospect br br long live weill
