i watched this movie because the idea was intriguing i felt right away that it wasn't going to have much of an ending it's not really the sort of story that would ever have a solid ending unless it was an episode of the twilight zone which it clearly was not meant to be br br so i can accept the weak ending and i'll even accept the analysis of one of the user reviewers here richard burke or was it robert whose analysis struck me as completely reasonable and well though out and thus accept that the movie more-or-less makes sense br br the problem is this is a really boring movie i don't know what the people who talk about it being suspenseful are thinking because this movie moves like grass growing it is so slow that after the first half hour i put it on fast forward the advantage of subtitles is you can watch a movie like that even at double the ordinary speed it was still slow moving
