jill sprecher the enormous talent behind clockwatchers needs to be seen more often we saw this witty comedy in its original debut and it was a pleasure to watch it again on ifc ms sprecher and her sister karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way temps are used in an office and it's at the same time a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie br br each one of the young women in the film has a problem they come together because they don't have a life on their own iris margaret paula and jane form a bond because they find safety in numbers iris is a clever girl whose shyness doesn't let her assert herself and is dragged along by the others that show stronger personalities margaret puts up a front but deep down she is just as vulnerable as the others the most pathetic one is paula a woman who is pretending to be what she is not jane is waiting for the security of marriage to beat it out of being a temp br br when the sneaky cleo is hired as a permanent employee the problems in the office are magnified as things begin disappearing from the office all eyes point to the four temps that is the beginning of the end of the clique as they knew it iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office but alas it's too late because at that time she leaves the temp job br br toni collette parker posey lisa kudrow and alana ubach are perfect as the four temps toni collette has a better role where to shine as most of the story is seen through her eyes parker posey is delightful as the free spirited margaret lisa kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic paula helen firzgerald who only has a few lines cast a giant shadow as the creepy new employee that wants to make friends with iris only to be ignored br br the sprecher sisters created a film that feels real a situation one has seen is prevalent in the office setting
