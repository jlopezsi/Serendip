display of commercially calculated formulaic cynical uninspired and empty hollywood movie-making in at least 5 years there are only two movies since say 1999 that i have had to seriously battle the urge to walk out of and this was one of them and i will sit through pretty much anything by the by the other movie was saving silverman this movie is offensively predictable and mind-numbingly brain-corrosively unfunny in it's best moments the best analogy to made is to imagine someone sitting around the camp-fire telling a story the person telling the story is drunk and half-asleep and he is telling that story to someone who is presumably retarded in this scenario the story-teller is this movie and you and i fellow movie-goers are yes the retard yes it is that insulting sad to say samuel l.jackson as cool as he was is now a hack collecting a paychecheque for any movie that pays him to utter any variation on a sentence that includes the word motherfucker and sneer every second line of dialogue in that now clich√©d semi-yell he trademarked in pulp fiction.i saw this movie for free and still regret the two hours of my life i will never get back consider this rant as my therapeutic outlet a very bad movie this has been a public service announcement
