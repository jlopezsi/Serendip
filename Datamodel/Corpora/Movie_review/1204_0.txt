actor darren mcgavin plays private detective mike hammer in the space of 30 minutes he normally escapes a couple assassination attempts beats at least one man to a pulp flirts with one or more beautiful women fires off some 50s tough-guy slang and solves a perplexing mystery the pace is very fast br br the premise of the show is that the world is an evil violent place and the strong and upright must be as tough as the bad guys to set things right but that doesn't mean they can't have a little fun along the way enjoying broads booze or other masculine entertainments as circumstances present themselves br br i do not know that i have ever seen a tv character so quick to use his fists or a gun when trouble arises and when mike hammer beats you he does not just knock you down or knock you out he continues beating you as the blood spurts out and you beg for mercy then he beats you some more even innocent witnesses are pushed around until they give up their information that he is not imprisoned for his frequent violent assaults is a miracle he does frequently fall afoul of the police receiving threats being questioned and sometimes being locked up but only temporarily br br in the world of mike hammer there is no such thing as a flat-chested or overweight woman except for the occasional wife or grandmother the show is populated by beautiful large-breasted women with well-coiffed hair wearing tight dresses that show off their curves and push-up bras that are so stiff and lift breasts so high they threaten to poke out your eyes mike flirts with and openly leers at these women in a way that would surely make viewers uncomfortable today br br with only 30 minutes to play with the characters are often one-dimensional women except when evil sluts are weaklings dominated by men they are either helpless victims or madly attracted to mike or incidental holders of information he needs or mere eye-candy populating his world sometimes they are the tool of a bad guy used to lure mike into a trap then sent on their way men are not treated much better the line between good and evil is starkly drawn and the most complex a character other than mike usually gets is when someone thought to be good turns out to be evil br br there are many pluses a lot happens the evil plots are often complex and ingenious the show employs a great deal of humor and tries not to take itself too seriously br br in the final analysis mike hammer is on the right side he fights against crime and bravely protects the weak despite the risk to himself if you had trouble and were in the right there is no one better you could have on your side he is strong violent cynical and testosterone-fueled the epitome of 50s cool br br despite the shortcomings of the show it is entertaining and the fast pace ensures you will not get bored
