i can't believe people actually attempted to take this film seriously none of the actors involved seemed to especially the always dapper donald sutherland who devours lines like i can fly a helicopter with campy relish if you're a hardcore heinlein freak don't bother with puppet masters it'll only break your heart but if you're a fan of extremely goofy preposterous sci-fi nonsense run out and rent it today grab a couple of your more cheese-tolerant buddies and a couple of six packs and settle in for a couple of hours of goo acting clumsily depicted paranoia and some gut-busting laughs
