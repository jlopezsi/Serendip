when you combine robert deniro our greatest actor and billy crystal one of our greatest comedians how can you go wrong it was a joy to see the two greats on screen together they were absolutely magnificent and had incredible chemistry the way their personalities conflicted with one another was a riot another noteworthy member in the cast is joe viterelli who's also a riot as deniro's henchman jelly lisa kudrow has some funny moments and chazz palminteri is chazz he's such a cool actor that his mere appearance can make a film worthwhile he only has a supporting role but he's great as always br br the film has some priceless gags some of the best lines i've ever heard were from this movie one that really sticks out is when deniro consults crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't get it up yes it's what you're thinking when crystal advises him to take some sort of drugs to help his problem deniro replies drugs i don't take drugs a hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not be gotten at all crystal replies in a dry sarcastic tone i think mark twain said that i also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time in crystal's office deniro asks the shrink br br do you know me yes he replies no you don't no i don't did you see my picture in the paper yes no you didn't no i didn't br br and there's a great interaction in which crystal explains a theory by sigmund freud about a child in greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother deniro quickly replies br br are you saying i wanna f k my mother have you seen my mother well freud said well freud's a sick f k br br there's so many memorable moments but i don't want to give them all away to those who haven't seen the movie because these are some of the funniest gags in film history one moment and this will be the last one i'll mention that also made me roll with laughter was the funeral sequence in which a family member got a little over-affectionate with crystal deniro replies him i don't know br br when i saw at in theaters the place was filled up and people would laugh out loud in unison like a fifties sitcom audience at every funny scene that's a rare occurrence and i feel great joy whenever it actually happens br br the comedy is not done in blatant screwball fashion the actors let the laughs come to them and play it straight crystal has a magic way of delivering sarcastic dialogue that only people like albert brooks and woody allen can surpass deniro spoofs his gangster persona without being superficial about it he lets the audience search for the inside jokes on their own people say deniro is not suited for comedy sure he's not the jim carrey-type of comic actor but i think that's what makes it work in films like this and meet the parents deniro doesn't try too hard and is never over-the-top he expresses the comic dialogue with good timing and good delivery without making it look like he's trying to be funny and joe viterelli who's been in other movies but i first discovered him on this one is great at playing the bumbling henchman and i hope to see him more often he has great talent br br analyze this is a hilarious wildly original comedy that should have you rolling in the aisles this is one comedy that won't make you leave with guilt you're watching two great performers and the humor though sometimes racy is all in good taste br br my score 8 out of 10
