at the beginning we can see members of troma team company and uwe boll says this is bad it's a big s don't watch it don't even think about it stay away from this movie now we are warn br br but they are wrong the film is brilliant ok it have a lot bad things like no budget of course no good acting no fancy fx no good location no good editing no good sound etc in fact in all technical aspect the film is bad but that's not a surprise but when you watch zombiegeddon a lot of this disappear or make the film pretty funny and that's the power of this movie the film is fun good fun because it's not an annoying and boring movie no that's more a good horror/comedy between shawn of the dead and an ed wood movie and that's really enjoying to see a movie like that make you smile at least 75 of the time the movie is really cool great troma movie
