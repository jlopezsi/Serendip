the tiger blade starts with a great kick off and manage to hold that throughout the entire movie the story might not be that clear but actually it doesn't matter you just go with the flow and accept the holes in the story which are filled in with great action scenes it's thai and of course you're thinking about ong-bak but the tiger blade does use wire work and probably stunt men but it does't mean the action would be less the direction is good and it shows that the greatest attention went to the action aspect would that bother the story of ong-bak isn't also that great just forget the story tolerate the acting performances and you're settled for a good action ride it deserves your attention when you loved ong-bak and the russian night watch because it's a perfect combination of those two
