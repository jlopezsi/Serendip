an almost completely satisfying 85 minutes i'd have a hard time coming up with five minutes of the movie i'd like to see cut out the movie starts off slow but intense and gradually builds to fast and even more intense both leads are of course great there are a lot of plot holes and logic jumps but that's almost a given in a conspiracy-themed movie aside from that there are really only a few small complaints to make the action ending seems a little contrived some of the foley work is pretty weak a major character meets his/her demise in an extremely unsatisying manner there's a couple of sloppy edits towards the end the establishing shots are stolen from nypd blue but really when i'm so desperate for downsides that i'm nitpicking the editing you know it's a great movie patrick yau is well on his way to becoming one of the best directors in hong kong
