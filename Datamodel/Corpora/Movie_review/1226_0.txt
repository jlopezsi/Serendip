in the style of edgar g ulmer's detour inner sanctum is a cheap little film noir and one that gains all of it's successes from its plot rather any technical elements the main problem with this film therefore is simply that there isn't enough of it and while the plot and characters that we get introduced to are good they could have been a whole lot better if the film had more of a budget to play with the plot focuses on the idea of guilt and its effect on a man that has killed someone we follow harold dunlap a man that decides to stay at a boarding house after killing a woman at a near-by station the plot focuses on the interloper as well as the people already living at the house and all the thrills are garnered through that the film is tense and exciting and it's also a good indication of how times have changed i mean would you let your kid sleep in a room that is currently being inhabited by a male guest that you've only just met well you would if it was this kid as inner sanctum features what is probably the most irritating child performance of all time but aside from that the cast is strong and the film is well directed by lew landers who also directed bela lugosi and boris karloff in the raven some years earlier recommended to noir fans
