i've watched it 15 times in a row on an old vhs commercial<br br release that includes the raven what a wonderful pair br br some comments seem to find it a plot hole when lugosi kills a<br br house pet and no one is alarmed indeed not something<br br common in the world as we know it my view is that the black cat is karloff whom lugosi goes there to<br br kill slowly does he not also in a few moments we see that karloff has the same black cat<br br in hand very much alive and he mentions the cat has nine lives other words are said about the two men having in effect already<br br died years ago look beneath the surface of this movie don't<br br take it literally and much richness is there the art deco bauhaus<br br architecture the wondrous infusion of beethoven's 7th after the<br br 2nd appearance of the black cat i could watch this movie a hundred more times and not tire of it
