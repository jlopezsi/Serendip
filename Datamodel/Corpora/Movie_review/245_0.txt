one wishes for more for more talent in such a film the actors looked like they're fresh from acting class amateurish come on the filmmaker could have done better apart from some rare funny seconds i thought this film was a bore i didn't find it refreshing but rather stiff and stale like old bread when a user said the filmmaker is brilliant come on this is a bit much i find it rather ironic that someone would call this film brilliant is this a joke or people have lost their minds i saw a lot of good films at the festival but this one didn't do much for me the title intrigued me at first but it should be really named last call for no much to see
