gregori chukhrai makes a very powerful and poignant protest against the horror and futility of war there is no whining no accusing only a very real and believable look at the effect that it has on some very ordinary people people that each of us can relate to i have to classify this as my all time favorite war movie if you have a choice watch it with the russian language and subtitles the warmth is missing in the overdubbed voices in the dubbed version although my russian is as limited as possible the emotion that is portrayed by the vocalizations of the actors is powerful one is certain to fall in love with either vladimir ivashov or zhanna prokhorenko this is one of those rare films that each time one watches it one gleans more from it and feels that much closer to the film the director/writer and to the actors
