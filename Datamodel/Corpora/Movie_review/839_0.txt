a holiday romance reworks the story of white christmas for modern times it is a pleasant movie worth watching for the christmas season however expect a double dose of the overworked situations of an authoritarian parent and the child who suffers the major general's story of white christmas is split between two characters so that the movie works well as a separate tale only if you are familiar with the original would you get an inkling that the two stories are related gerald macraney does his usual strong character music is a plus if you like christmas carols jazzed up a little naomi judd does a credible job andy griffith shows his matlock image rather than the lighter andy griffith show personification
