i absolutely adore this show i stumbled upon it by accident in 1999 on a school lunch break and have been hooked ever since sky one cruelly axed it and then channel 5 picked it up unfortunately this was only a brief period br br its been off uk screens until i salute you zone romantica for bringing days of our lives back into our lives its roughly a year thats past in episodes so its easy catch up on yes the story lines sets and acting are very comical at times thats just what makes it so addictive i loved the whole garden of eden storyline with greta and austin oh how i wish carrie would come back and get austin away from sammie anyway the princess gina thing was so good i really hope marlena starts her radio agony aunt show again that was classic well enjoy people zone romantica weekdays 9am 2.40pm 9pm sky digital channel 149
