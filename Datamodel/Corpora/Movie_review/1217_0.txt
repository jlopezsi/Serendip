this black and white movie has many fine moments but it does not have the top box office cast which could have made it a classic it has a small town feel similar to picnic with william holden but it did not have william holden and kim novak br br the lead actors do their scenes well the guy and gal just aren't quite right for a feature film the female lead is beautiful enough to be in any movie in any role she also was great in her scenes but this movie just needs a bogart and bacall or tracy and hepburn or dana andrews and gene tierney the rest of the cast is fine br br the boy who plays mike is the best part of this movie there is a bedroom scene with him and the villain which rings so true for its era watch as the male lead plays some word games in the dark with the kid innocence and terror side by side it was common in the 1940s to have two guys sleeping in the same bed in movies especially in comedies but also in alfred hitchcock's the lady vanishes in this movie the guys sleep together in one room but with separate beds br br this is a very good movie but it could have been great this might make a good double bill with picnic or strangers on a train or the lady vanishes br br i hope dale belding mike is still alive and well
