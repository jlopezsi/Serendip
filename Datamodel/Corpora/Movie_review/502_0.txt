who cares about the plot there wasn't one the best thing about this movie is the top notch music and performers having all those folks in one film is incredible a hundred years from now this film would be a great case study of the r b soul and blues of this time and this tease.stay after the final credits and you will be greatly rewarded for this type of film i wish there was 2 scoring systems one for the plot and the other for the music
