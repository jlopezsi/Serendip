ringu 0 fills in a few of the blanks in the ringu series like for starters why she was shunned and how she came to be in the well young sadako is part of a theater troupe and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't at least not yet there are glimpses of sadako's strange powers which she can't seem to control when she's threatened there are snippets here and there about her mother and her father and her childhood and it all eventually leads up to the sadako that we all know and love the one in the well now she's also cast as an understudy or as they call it here apprentice in a play and somehow the star dies horribly while sitting right there in the midst of her fellow actors sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play it changes everything and sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast but stopped just short of harm to anyone except herself after this point the film takes off but i'll leave that to you to find out what happens if you like not the best of this series that i've seen but good for filling in a few blanks here there 7 out of 10
