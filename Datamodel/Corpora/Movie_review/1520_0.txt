this movie while not perfect is just another one of steve martin's good comedies of the 1980's where he was on fire in my opinion he had so many comedies that i enjoyed that it is rather surprising this is mainly considering the fact that the comedy movie is something now i virtually never go to the movies to see unless it is like a comedy/something other than comedy movie like zombieland this film also is one of the reasons i had issues with the movie forrest gump winning an oscar for special effects look at this film and a later comedy kung pow and the things they made such a big deal of the fact they placed tom hanks with dead people is just not that big a deal they did it here quite well granted a lot of the time the person had their back to steve i still rather thought it was well done the comedy is good mainly consisting of steve martin's various looks and responses to the sometimes long dead actor's scenes from previous movies though the funniest part was the scene involving the dog poop which i will admit was rather childish compared to the rest of the comedy in this film but it still got me laughing the hardest
