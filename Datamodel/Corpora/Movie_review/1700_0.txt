br br yes i am one of those users who see a bad film and go out and complain about it never saying good things about the films we like so i decided to rectify br br the wizard of speed and time is a great movie it puts a big fat libertarian smile on this libertarian face of mine it makes me want to go out and be a filmmaker it makes me want to go out and land a helicopter on that big green plastic rock br br it makes me want to follow my dreams and follow my heart thanks to a good amount of brainwashing courtesy of the green man himself the wonderful mike jittlov br br so see the movie you'll see dancing romancing financing fencing crowd scenes chase scenes this is the motion picture with everything it's even got the kitchen sink it's the kind of movie you would make if you didn't have anything better to do br br grin thanks
