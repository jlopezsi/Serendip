this movie is underrated i expected to see the average rating of 7 but instead i see 5.8 br br i read a comment which claims this movie is bit dull but thats not true this movie contains action combined with comedy real comedy only few slapstick ones br br this movie me a wise guy will say its very good i'll give it a 5/6 rating its very enjoyable and has great music in it br br this is definitely worth watching for anyone that likes action comedy movies the fight scenes aren't serious they are normal comedy ones you see in the late 90 and early 2000 jackie chan movies but 1 of the jackie chans character is hot headed
