i have been lucky enough to have this fashion parade comedy musical film in my life since the mid 70s when new zealand tv stations sent all their old 16mm prints to australia for junking instead most of these 500 prints were found be in mint full length condition as a result they were hired out and i operated a cinema and ran dozens and dozens of them br br among this incredible library was roberta which seemed to always be programmed every other month or two so my first viewing was in a lovely old cinema with a perfect print and a big audience i have never recovered and never want to every time i see roberta i swoon from the sheer beauty of every part of this gorgeous film 30 years later i can watch it on tape on tv and still get the same overwhelming emotional bliss knowing what it is doing to me i admire the fashionable production and the team so much because they knew what they were doing to the audience too presenting a sublime musical confection that is exquisite enough to make the viewer pass out from aching satisfaction find it see it love it have this film in your life and just absorb every second of its absolute perfection
