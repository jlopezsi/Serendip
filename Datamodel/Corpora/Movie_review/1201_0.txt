i believe the song title you are seeking is entitled street scene written by alfred newman from the 1931 movie of the same name br br the aforementioned film has experienced a renaissance precisely because everyone wants to know where the mike hammer theme originated br br it is certainly very haunting and i personally spent many years seeking out the sheet music which was very difficult to find in the 1960s br br it is a great composition and i admire anyone's taste in music who has spent any effort to seek out this original classic br br houdini
