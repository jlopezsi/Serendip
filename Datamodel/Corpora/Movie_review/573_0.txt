this is my first review on imdb okay here goes so this movie is about a seemingly supernatural killer clown the mascot of the extremely popular local burger joint hella burger he murders teenagers all of whom have some sort of connection with the main character mackenzie he gives her clues as to who will die next she starts to piece together the puzzle and must stop him before he claims her life next br br basically it's a comedy/horror the film doesn't take itself very seriously and is full of random humour you'll laugh out loud at most of the scenes it's still a horror movie and contains plenty of innovative and gory kills overall i recommend it to horror fans or anyone who has 1 hour 23 min's to spare for a few laughs it's the kind of film you simply switch your brain off and enjoy
