deadwood is a landmark in tv dramatisation technically as well as logistically it's also a superb multi-level drama and a stunningly accurate-seeming who knows for sure recreation of a gold rush town with layers of thought-provoking parallels to our modern political situation the trouble with its overall excellence is that one or two faults stick out like chicken bones in a tobacco wad br br plot spoilers over the whole series there's a sense of anticlimax among the much-trumpeted gangs of hired guns and the convoluted human tragedies the main baddie simply leaves town swearengen decides to kill a scapegoat and that's it we are already aware that he has a heart so the decision not to kill trixie is a given while deadwood is commendably faithful to the idea of realism in the plot most of the time dramatically this becomes a letdown and nor is it made clear enough why just killing hearst wouldn't work i anticipated a new take on a three-way gun battle and when that didn't happen there wasn't much agonising about anything else and there were far too many loose ends drama suffered here for realism's sake br br characters there are some classic cameos in deadwood my favourites are doc cochran reverend smith why no website profile and richardson and trixie is amazingly modern and three-dimensional the character that doesn't work for me is calamity jane in spite of robin weigert's faultless realisation of the script i see where milch is coming from she's a lovable drunk as opposed to say steve the unlovable drunk but you only have to see one photo of the actual woman to realise that they've been extremely kind in their casting if you're going to make calamity jane's reason for being in it being a pioneering lesbian she's got to be the bullest of bull dykes robin weigert's just a misunderstood tomboy where was the realism here i also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced if you left the langrishe theatre group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot and while brian cox is as good as i've ever seen him that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors and it did powers boothe turned from a believable rival to al into a moustache-twirling pantomime villain less convincing than e.b farnum the two sassy soldiers at the stirgis election were fantastically menacing where was the menace apart from hearst per se in deadwood itself br br performances the one performance that really lets deadwood down from an olympian height for me is timothy olyphant he looks great and ranges from caring husband to psycho killer beautifully so why is it that i keep thinking he's about to burst out laughing at the wrong moment maybe he's just trying to hide his cute teeth instead of baring and grinding them he's like roger moore as james bond just too smooth i wonder if that's why they kept giving seth bullock all those scars the face-pummelling on the floor almost becomes a running gag br br from the start i really thought deadwood was going to blow me away in the end while it sets the bar for hi-def tv to come i felt it got bogged down in all that realism and eventually stopped being a better-than-first-rate drama and became a first-rate docu-drama with a bit too much over-acting in places and far far more cast than was well utilised but it's a pioneering chunk of tv best seen and heard in hd
