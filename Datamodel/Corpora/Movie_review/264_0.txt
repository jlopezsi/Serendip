i've watched this movie countless times and never get bored it provides sheer entertainment and some of the best one-liners i've heard in a movie it is equal opportunity in its derogatory remarks and racism and that's part of the charm people get too worked up over stereotypes and being offended but they shouldn't this is a movie not a political commentary the actors have done a superb job of creating humour out of an awkward situation two men who happen to be gay live together own a business and must play it straight for the benefit of their son's in-laws br br i think i understand why the critical review has been mediocre it's likely because critics keep comparing the birdcage with the original la cage aux folles i wish critics would rate a movie for what it is and not for what it compares to the birdcage as a stand-alone movie is witty funny silly and entertaining and that's what makes it so enjoyable it's one of my favourite comedies and i can watch it over and over again
