as standard direct-to-video erotica goes this film isn't bad but remember these films aren't about the plot or the acting but about the flesh let's face it if you're truly looking for a good movie then you know from the title that this isn't likely to be the answer so a movie like this comes down to what you think of the appearance of the female leads sexist but true for me tane mcclure looked old and tired and plastic just like she always does but gabriella hall made the movie bearable for she is simply drop-dead gorgeous with a stunning body and a face to match i'd apologize for the superficial review but that's what these movies are all about they're all about liking what you see since the writing is rarely good enough for you to like what you hear
