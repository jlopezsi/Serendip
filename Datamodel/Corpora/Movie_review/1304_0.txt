i wasn't very captured by the movie the story sounded so promising i even watched it despite the fact that i hated the art i am a huge anime fan and it just didn't do it for me the relationship between black and white was awesome but i fell asleep because i found it so boring i even watched the rest of it despite already not liking it even the art style has it's ups and downs for something that i hated the art style for it was animated very well i did enjoy the colouring and i loved the backgrounds i suppose if you were to watch an anime for the colors and backgrounds this would be a good one to pick br br oh well it's not for everybody or maybe even just me because my friend loved this movie to no end it's gonna be his birthday present p
