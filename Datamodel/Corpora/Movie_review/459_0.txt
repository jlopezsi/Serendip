swimmers is a wonderful film the story really pulls you in and is very touching the audience is able to identify with many of the characters since common human strengths and faults are expressed in this film the acting is superb the watermen characters are right on emma is an endearing character and made me teary-eyed throughout the movie the friendship between emma and meryl is as believable as it is sweet anyone from a small town will be able to identify with the story of swimmers other parts of this film that i really enjoyed were the scenes of the water the shots of the water and the boats were beautiful
