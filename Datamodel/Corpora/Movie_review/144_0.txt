i fell in love with this film from the moment i first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program at first i was drawn to the action elements being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes but i was blown away by the romance and character interplay i loved the composition of the scenes the noirish lighting and the quirky humor this movie along with pedro almodovar's films really opened my eyes to european films particularly those with a signature style br br the performances are great across the board anne parillaud plays all facets of nikita well from her rebellious drug-hazed beginning to her growing confidence and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart tcheky karyo made a huge impression mostly through his body language and his eyes he says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue jeanne moraeu is a treasure a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit jean-hughues anglade has the harder part the normal guy who nikita falls for he is adept at comedy but is tender in the love scenes he carries himself well in his face-off with bob finally the actor who really stands out in memory jean reno reno oozes charisma and talent even in bad films he steals the film the moment he enters br br luc besson is a tremendous stylist his films are beautiful even when the story is a bit obtuse he is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning his main fault is that he lets style overtake story but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting he is a fine writer although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others br br finally one can't discuss the films of besson without discussing the music of eric serra serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration his compositions convey mood and emotion adding another layer to the story his signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments he demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers to transform the music rather than make up for lack of an orchestra or talent serra's soundtracks were the first that i bought for instrumental music rather than for pop songs used in the film br br this is a film that appeals to many audiences there is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers unique character studies quirky humor and above all romance it has spawned many imitations point of no return black cat nikita tv series but has never been equaled if you are a fan of film noir action/espionage character drama or romance you should see this film then you should own this film you'll want to watch it again and again
