this sucked i only watched it because pusher was entertaining the only good thing about this is that filmmakers can see how a hand-held camera and available lighting can make a film cheap and fast bummer br br i was amused to see how white racism is universal as a black person from the u.s it was interesting to hear danish muslims referred to as niggers when they looked like white folks to me i guess all non-whites are niggers when you feel threatened by immigrants sad br br i'm not sure i would watch any of the directors other work based on this like i said before pusher was engaging and you were sucked into that world here you just didn't care
