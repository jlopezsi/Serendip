wheels of terror is exactly what it sounds like a cheesy after school thriller special that is meant to be laughed at at least i hope it's meant to be laughed at you have a scary looking car that seems to be terrorizing kids at their school so one of the staff members decides that instead of calling the police she'll take matters into her own hands and chase the man down herself it's good to see a woman taking the initiative like that in the movies but then what do they do they have the chase scenes take place with her in the short bus a laughable story routine direction no acting and an absolutely pathetic ending all come together to make wheels of terror a perfect movie to never watch
