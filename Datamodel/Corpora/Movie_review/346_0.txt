absolutely superb i don't think i've ever given anything a 10/10 before but for a tv show deadwood is excellent and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box absolutely outstanding the sets the research the directing the characters the acting all shine and without wanting to sound gushy the script is close to shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone the juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real wild west with formal victorian language is genius even the opening credits are beautiful it may not be everyone's cup of tea the language and content can be a little strong although entirely appropriate and in context but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment shouldn't go past it
