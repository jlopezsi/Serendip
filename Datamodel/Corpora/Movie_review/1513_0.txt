i watched this twice this day and then hollered for my husband to see this he actually laughed aloud during scenes where i rolled my eyes however i must add that i too had a fun time i did enjoy the premise meaning the interaction/interjection of the 40's film noir characters slipped into this br br i also admit that going in i knew that the combo of steve martin with carl reiner's direction it was going to be somewhat silly but wow it was done wonderfully and again i had a fun time being that gorgeous rachel ward agreed to costar in this was a plus shows she had a tremendous sense of humor let alone shedding any ego br br oh see it it's in the caliber of something mel brooks would pull-off i dvr'd it and i may watch it another 20 times
