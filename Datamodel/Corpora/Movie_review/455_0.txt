wow what a gem i wonder how sadler director managed to elicit such performances from the entire cast i kept waiting for an awkward or flat note from one of the actors but it never happened completely convincing characters and the accents are right on dialect coach and director deserve accolades i was particularly impressed with how the merill character turned out she could have so easily been the stereotypical vampy-sexy-screwed-up character but she was so fragile and so not in charge of herself while still remaining appealing and with cherry jones of course sit down shelly and sean hatosy is heartbreakingly dear could he possibly be anything other than a small-town cop searching for stronger self-esteem br br i also am amazed that a movie with such seemingly humble and unglamorous themes has such a breathless pace no one could ever fault this sleeper/swimmer for being slow br br i am eager to see who is smart enough to pick up this film this young writer/director is going places and some fortunate and talented people are going along for the ride/swim
