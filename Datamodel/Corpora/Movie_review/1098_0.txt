this is an excellent jackie chan film that gets too little credit and too much criticism this movie is just plain fun chan as twin brothers separated at birth who reunite many years later in hong kong just in time to get crossed up in a nasty mess with vicious gangsters how can you not love this in addition to using the wonderful plot premise of twins and two jackie chans is definitely better than one there's some great action choreography in this movie including some nice big explosions and what has to be one of the best uses ever conceived of for a mitsubishi factory br br the psychic link between the twin chans is used to great effect as well in everything from the hilarious conducting scene to the subtly painful groin shot during the auto factory fight br br and the ending is simply brilliant br br i definitely recommend this understated oft-overlooked gem to all chan fans
