i am in love with this film when i was younger 18 or so i saw this movie for the first time late night on a premium cable channel and loved it it was adventurous and foreign it's soft core and may disappoint some viewers but the story is entertaining and the scenery interesting i have not seen the first one yet but am eager to the 3 dvd set on amazon looks great just a very intriguing film beautifully erotic and sensual the setting of hong kong is beautiful and you never really know what emmanuelle is going to do next or who she is going to do i think it's the european charm and 70's style of the film that makes it feel rare and naughty
