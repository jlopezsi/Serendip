being a fan of cyberflics like hackers and the net and having a thing for movies based on tom clancy novels i thought this movie was sure to be a winner too bad it turned out to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the kind that gives me a new-found respect for movies that i thought were bad before seriously this movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever br br where do i start let's go with plot it's unbelievably boring from start to finish not only that but it's hopelessly confusing with new characters being introduced every 2 seconds so you can't keep all of them straight plus the plot is so unrealistic and cheezy i found myself frequently rolling my eyes the endless baricade of cliches doesn't help any i could guess what was coming next at almost every part of the movie br br the acting was just plain awful everyone did a terrible job of portraying emotions or lack thereof it was often hard to tell if they were even trying to do a good job br br i wanted to kick the man in charge of filming the movie nearly every other scene nearly 75 of the movie is shot with what appears to be an 8mm videocamera rather than movie film this is probably the biggest mistake as it only adds to the shoddy atmosphere making it look like a home movie rather than a commercial production br br i never turn off a movie before it is finished even if it is really bad this is because there is always the possibility that the movie will suddenly get good and i fall in love with it which has happened before quite a few times actually the final action scene was almost half-good however it was too little too late if the producers of this film expected one semi-decent scene to make up for 3 hours of crap they are utterly mistaken br br fortunately some good things can come from this movie it makes a nifty doorstop paperweight and doggy chew toy br br i recommend this movie to absolutely no one if you come across a netforce tape drop it onto the floor and smash it by jumping on it repeatedly afterwards be sure to grind your heel into it br br i give this movie a 1 out of 10
