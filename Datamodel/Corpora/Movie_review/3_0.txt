not very many movies come to my mind that covered as much geography as this one br br naturally being a hollywood product there is not a whole lot of realism here but there is a whole lot of entertainment and a whole lot of talent br br louis wollheim apparently never became a household name but his performance in this film would indicate he should have br br in one priceless scene when without inter-titles the bill boyd character whispers the explanation of a word often found in the bible wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile br br lewis milestone's direction is another plus this was still early in his career but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance br br ian keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles br br being a silent film two arabian knights probably won't be shown even on turner classic movies very often but i urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it
