the opening sequence alone is worth buying a dolphins dvd this movie is one extended moment of intense beauty more like a modern dance performance than a theatrical production br br there is no dialog so don't worry about having to deal with sub-titles inherent foreign films the movie unveils itself in such a way as to reach any person in any modern culture br br the story is small and the plot simplistic but you won't care i promise
