this isn't one of jackie chan's better films two babies are separated at birth one becomes a maestro and another becomes a mechanic for some reason when one brother is doing the other one start doing the same thing the two meet in a washroom partly thanks to their girlfriends two jackie chans produce less action then one jackie chan not much happens during the movie the movie has some good moments of humor but there are no good action scenes until the end of the movie the black and white beginning is a true testament to bad acting this idea of identical twins being separated at birth is not an original idea jean-claude van damme did a movie just like this but a lot worse watch who am i instead of this one
