well to me it was nicole kidman which made me rent this dvd br br i watched if after bridget jones the edge of reason because i reckoned i needed something serious after that fairy-tale but i was not prepared to see what it was coming br br i honestly hated the story i find it appalling that somebody would think of such a f ked up story and even though there are some cgis used for some of the scenes where the two main characters meet i still think this is a sick tale to put on screen br br however there is something interesting about this film despite its many flaws as if they did not have enough money to properly edit it nicole kidman is wonderful once again playing the part which suits her like a glove a very beautiful woman entirely consumed by all sorts of dramas the others dogville are just two other examples and yes that shot at the opera is just amazing brilliant apart from nicole kidman there is also the very special soundtrack which combined with the directing create an atmosphere of intense pressure eroticism beauty and darkness altogether br br also the image at the end of film on the beach will haunt me forever br br relax your nerves cause they will be stretched to the maximum at least that's what happened to mine
