i was immensely disappointed when i saw this after i had enjoyed most of the first beverly hills cop movie i had high hopes for this one as well to see danish brigitte nielsen in a big budget movie was also some sort of weird attraction to me at the time and i thought that i could at least have some fun seeing some banter between her and murphy but the expectation was far more attractive than actually seeing it they do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from murphy and nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with stallone nielsen's hubby at the time since he was to star in the first movie there is a poster of his cobra character to further heighten the suspicion br br the scenes mostly take place in smoke-filled rooms and you can hardly see any faces clearly the main villain played by j√ºrgen prochnow is such a anonymous character that you wonder why he even took the role was it because being in an eddie murphy film was so popular at the time that you just had to do it the three beverly hills cops also reprise their roles here but the lieutenant now promoted to captain only has a couple of scenes and it is really totally unbelievable that murphy's character and the captain are discussing going on a fishing trip could you even picture murphy with a fishing rod so what we have is slam-bang action scenes with wisecracks that mostly fall flat and i almost forgot the totally annoying cameo by gilbert gottfried one of murphy's fellow snl players as an accountant named sidney bernstein take this as a warning expect extreme agony through most of the running time and please do not wait to go to the bathroom if you are watching at the same time it is not worth the wait
