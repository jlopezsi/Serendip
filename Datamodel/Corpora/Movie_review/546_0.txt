i have never really given much thought to underground civilizations and the like but this movie definitely gets you thinking br br it's a bit slow to getting off the ground but stick with it it's well worth the wait br br i didn't think the movie would be so good from the beginning in fact to be honest there's quite a poor start to it and i suspect many would switch off before it gets going i remained open-minded i think that the idea was very imaginative indeed and my only complaint was the movie was over too quickly would have made a two and half hour movie no problem still the idea of any great movie like any great book is to leave you wanting more br br however it had a very satisfactory end br br don't miss this if you get the opportunity a gem worth watching
