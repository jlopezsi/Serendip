hellgate started off looking quite promising with an easy-to-follow plot three young people are reading stories about a girl who was killed and her father brings her back to life using a crystal the story starts to get confusing at this point it involves the group visiting hellgate where the re-animated girl seduces men for her father to kill i fell asleep at some point during the film not something i usually do and woke up near the end the ending actually wasn't too bad but nothing to wet yourself over br br the scene where the fish grows and bursts out of its tank and when the tortoise becomes a monster are cool watch this if you collect 80's horror films but be warned it has nothing going for it and is extremely dull
