yes finally funny and scary in the same movie old skool ok boyz and girlz here's the deal if you don't like this movie you are not core yes you see it all coming and it's familiar territory but that is the point they obviously went out to make an 80's slasher but it's how they do it that makes this thing rock see 4 yourself and tell me horny isn't the coolest killer to hack up some teens in years unreal costume hilarious total bad ass the music rocks you will laugh your ass off the gore is solid and the kills are fresh am i missing something here the chicks are hot but amazingly we see almost no skin which is why i didn't give it a 10 watching it again right now
