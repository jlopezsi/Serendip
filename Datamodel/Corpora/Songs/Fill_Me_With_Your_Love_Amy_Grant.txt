but there are so many who don't know the reason their lives are wasting away just souls without purpose they wonder in darkness without a thought for the day well i'm no savior i'm just a window through which your sweet love light can shine so clean out the corners of my darkened pane and fill me with your love again fill me with your love again fill me with your love again i open my heart and soul for you to enter me and fill me with your love again fill me with your love again fill me with your love again i open my heart and soul for you to enter me and fill me with your love again i open my heart and soul for you to enter me and fill me with your love again
