draw me a circle that's perfectly round one curving line simple and fine now add two ears and a lopsided nose and if you care add some hair now draw two eyes and make them bright because they've just seen a beautiful sight sketch in a mouth with a radiant grin one coming deep from within you've drawn me a circle and now that you're through it's a picture of me after being with you
