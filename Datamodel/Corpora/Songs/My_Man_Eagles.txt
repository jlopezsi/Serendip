tell me the truth how do you feel like you're rollin so fast that you're spinnin your wheels don't feel too bad you're not all along we're all tryin to get along with ev'rybody else try'n to go their way you're bound to get tripped and what can you say just go along til they turn out the lights there's nothin we can do to fight it no man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain and we who must remain go on living just the same i once knew a man very talented guy he's sing for the people and people would cry they knew that his song came from deep down inside you could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes and so he traveled along touch your heart then be gone like a flower he bloomed till that old hickory wind called him home my man's got it made he's gone far beyond the pain and we who must remain go on living just the same we who must remain go on laughing just the same
