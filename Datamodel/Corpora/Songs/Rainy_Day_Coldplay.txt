then there was rain the sky wore a veil of gold and gray at night it was the bright of the moon with me time just floated away then there was rain the town's foundations were crumbling to the ground comes a bit of a tumbling and time just floated away we can watch it and stay and we can listen oh rainy day come round sometimes i just want it to slow down and we're separated now i'm down but i love it when you come over to the house i love it when you come over to my house then there was rain and i spent the night with the queen of spain my lonely little heart would've broke again times were vicious singing deeper that the knife goes in the more you win you win but with less than when you begin deeper that the knife goes in oooooooooooooooh ooh rainy day come round sometimes i just want it to slow down we're separated now i'm down but i love it when you come over to the house i love it when you come over to my house aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah but i love it when you come over to the house i love it when you come over to my house but i love it when you come over to the house i love it when you come over to my house
