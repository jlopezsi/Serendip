being born was the worse and the first mistake i ever made the doctor didn't spank me he just slapped me in the face and the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt cause i was raised an orphan never wanted as a kid until the year i turned 13 then everybody did strangers pass me back and forth men just took me as they pleased and others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep though the deck is stacked against you win or lose you have to play the hand a life has dealt you and it's a gamble either way on a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress with the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck and the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time or should i fear what lay before me less than what i'd left behind a 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides but sometimes when you're riding free you'll pay the highest price on back roads and in back seats and in a cheap highway motel but what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else though the deck is stacked against you win or lose you have to play the hand a life has dealt you and it's a gamble either way 16 caught me crying underneath the scarlet light on the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night when i walked into the parlour here other pieces seemed to fit i was good at pleasing strangers so i made the most of it either way it's all a gamble so view the stakes and know the odds and lay your cards upon the table do all the dealing from the top though the deck is stacked against you win or lose you have to play the hand a life has dealt you and it's a gamble either way
