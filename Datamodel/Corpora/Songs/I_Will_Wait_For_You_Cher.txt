chorus if it takes forever i will wait for you for a thousand summers i will wait for you till you're back beside me till i'm holding you till i hear you sigh here in my arms anywhere you wonder anywhere you go everyday remember how i love you so in your heart believe what in my heart i know that forever more i'll wait for you if it takes forever i will wait for you for a thousand summers i will wait for you chorus
