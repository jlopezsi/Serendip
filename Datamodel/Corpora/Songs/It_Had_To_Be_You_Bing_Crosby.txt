why do i do just as you say why must i just give you your way why do i sigh why do i try to forget it must have been that something lovers call fate kept on saying i had to wait i saw them all just couldn't fall till we met it had to be you it had to be you i wandered around and finally found the somebody who could make me be true could make me be blue and even be glad just to be sad thinkin of you some others i've seen might never be mean might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do for nobody else gave me a thrill with all your faults i love you still it had to be you wonderful you it had to be you
