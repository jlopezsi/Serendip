goodbye time it's your life you say you need a change don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything you say it's different now and you keep staring at the door how can you walk away don't i matter anymore chorus if being free is worth what you leave behind and if it's too late for love to change your mind then it's goodbye time if we had known our love would come to this we could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years well it's been fun what else can i say if the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway chorus
