new sound all around you can hear it too getting hot never stop just for me and you playing on my radio and saying that you had to go new day turn away wipe away the tear new night feel right knowing that you're here dancing with you all the time and don't you think that it's a crime back street never meet never say goodbye i know where you go but i don't know why you say that it's from above and i say this is modern love
