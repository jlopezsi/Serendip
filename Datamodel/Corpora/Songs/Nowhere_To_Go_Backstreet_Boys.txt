looking for beauty in a certain finding the strength inside a gray maybe i'm heading for a breakdown and maybe that's ok could be i'm hanging on for dear life maybe i need to get a grip cause you're the only one that makes me feel like this so chorus save me i'm falling again keep me from breakin in a million pieces in the end no matter what i do there's nowhere nowhere to go nowhere to go but you tryin to make nothing out of something promise myself i wouldn't care maybe you're making me a liar cause i'm sitting here you finally crackin my resistance and find a way to wear me down yea i just look at you and there's no way out every single road i take it's you asleep or wide awake i know it's you and it's too late for anyone to save me i'm falling again keep me from breakin in a million pieces chorus x2 nowhere to go but you
