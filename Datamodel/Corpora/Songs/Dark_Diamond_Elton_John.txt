oh i'm a dark diamond i've turned hard and cold once was a jewel with fire in my soul there's two sides of a mirror one i couldn't break through stayed trapped on the inside wound up losing you tell me how does it work how do you make things fit spent all my life trying to get it right i've put it together and it falls apart i thought to myself i might understand but when the wall's built and the heart hardens you get a dark diamond dark diamond oh i'm a dark diamond but you're something else you read me more than i read myself the one star i could count on only comet i could trust you burnt through my life to the true meaning of love
