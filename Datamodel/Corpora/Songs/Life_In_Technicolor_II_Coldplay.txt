there's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street every night there the headlights are glowing there's a cold war coming on the radio i heard baby it's a violent world oh love don't let me go won't you take me where the streetlights glow i could hear it coming i could hear the sirens sound now my feet won't touch the ground time came a creepin oh and time's a loaded gun every road is a ray of light it goes on time only can lead you on still it's such a beautiful night oh love don't let me go won't you take me where the streetlights glow i could hear it coming like a serenade of sound now my feet won't touch the ground gravity release me and don't ever hold me down now my feet won't touch the ground
