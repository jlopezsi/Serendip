night's gonna fall letting the stars shine through and through time on the wall bringing me closer to the one i want i can't wait no more no no lost like a child even my knees are shaking caught for a while under a wave that's breaking over me in his arms i float when he looks at me this way i know what he'll say chorus get ready get set you ain't seen nothing yet all day all night here's something you can't forget get ready get set you ain't seen nothing yet all day all night here's something you can't forget i could try imagining something better than you and i making sweet love together taking me much farther than before when he looks at me this way i know just what he'll say ooh ooh when he looks at me this way i know just what he'll say na na na na na na na na
