can you remember remember my name as i flow through your life a thousand oceans i have flown oh and cold cold spirits of ice ice ice all my life i am the echo of your past i am returning the echo of a point in time in distant faces shine a thousand warriors i have known oh and laughing as the spirits appear oh all your life shadows of another day and if you hear me talking on the wind you've got to understand we must remain perfect strangers oh oh i know i must remain inside this silent well of sorrow oh a strand of silver hanging through the sky touching more than you see the voice of ages in your mind oh is aching with the dead of the night precious life your tears are lost in falling rain and if you hear me talking on the wind you've got to understand we must remain perfect strangers
