once i was a sentimental thing throw my heart away each spring now a spring romance hasn't got a chance promised my first dance to winter all i've got to show's a splinter for my little fling spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post i lay in my room starring up at the ceiling spring can really hang you up the most morning kiss wakes trees and flower and to them my life to drink a toast i walk in the park just to kill those lonely hours spring can really hang you up the most all afternoon those birds tweet-a-tweet i know their tune this is love this is it heard it before and i know the score and i decide that love is a bore love seem sure around the new year now it's april love is just a ghost spring arrived on time but what became of you dear spring can really hang you up the most spring can really hang you up the most spring is here there's no mistaken robins build their nest from coast to coast my heart tries the same so they won't hear it breaking spring can really hang you up the most college boys are riding somewhere tender passion there it grows but i'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet spring can really hang you up the most love came my way i'm holding the last we had our day now that's all in the past spring came along a season of song for love's sweet promise but something went wrong doctor's once prescribed a tonic sulfur and molasses was the dose didn't help me a bit my condition must be chronic spring can really hang you up the most all alone the party's over winter was a gracious host but when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover spring can really hang you up the most
