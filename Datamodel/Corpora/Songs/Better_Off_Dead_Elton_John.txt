there was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on and just enough time for the night to pass by without warning away in the distance there's a blue flashing light someone's in trouble somewhere tonight as the flickering neon stands ready to fuse the wind blows away all of yesterday's news well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches they always could find us but they never could catch us through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe we watched the arrested get taken away and that cigarette haze has ecology beat as the whores and the drunks filed in from the street cause the steam's in the boiler the coal's in the fire if you ask how i am then i'll just say inspired if the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died
