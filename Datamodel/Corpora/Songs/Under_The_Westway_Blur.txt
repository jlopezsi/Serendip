there were blue skies in my city today everything was sinking said snow would come on sunday the old school was due and the traffic grew upon the westway where i stood watching comets lonesome trails shining up above me the jet fuel it fell down to earth where the money always comes first and the sirens sing bring us the day they switch off the machines cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts inside my dreams an automated song and the whole world gone fallen under the spell of the distance between us when we communicate still picking up shortwave somewhere they're out in space it depends how you're wired when the night's on fire under the westway now it's magic arrows hitting the bull doing one eighty still standing at last call when the flags coming down and the last post sounds just like a love song for the way i feel about you paradise not lost it's in you on a permanent basis i apologize but i am going to sing hallelujah sing it out loud and sing it to you am i lost out at sea til a tide wash me up off the westway
