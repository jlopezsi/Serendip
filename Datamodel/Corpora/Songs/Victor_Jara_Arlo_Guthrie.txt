words by adrian mitchell music by arlo guthrie victor jara of chile lived like a shooting star he fought for the people of chile with his songs and his guitar his hands were gentle his hands were strong victor jara was a peasant he worked from a few years old he sat upon his father's plow and watched the earth unfold his hands were gentle his hands were strong now when the neighbors had a wedding or one of their children died his mother sang all night for them with victor by her side his hands were gentle his hands were strong he grew up to be a fighter against the people's wrongs he listened to their grief and joy and turned them into songs his hands were gentle his hands were strong he sang about the copper miners and those who worked the land he sang about the factory workers and they knew he was their man his hands were gentle his hands were strong he campaigned for allende working night and day he sang take hold of your brothers hand you know the future begins today his hands were gentle his hands were strong then the generals seized chile they arrested victor then they caged him in a stadium with five-thousand frightened men his hands were gentle his hands were strong victor stood in the stadium his voice was brave and strong and he sang for his fellow prisoners till the guards cut short his song his hands were gentle his hands were strong they broke the bones in both his hands they beat him on the head they tore him with electric shocks and then they shot him dead his hands were gentle his hands were strong repeat first verse
