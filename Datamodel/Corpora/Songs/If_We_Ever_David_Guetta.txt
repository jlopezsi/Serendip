i've been fragile for a long time a big old hole inside my heart and i was searching through the valley stumbled on love in the dark was afraid to try but afraid to never know what it feels like to be loved had a hill to climb but the places we could go oh i gotta know so if we ever fell in love would the wind blow would the pain go oh so if we ever fell in love oh oh oh i was empty it was all gone the birds would sing but made no sound till i met you found i was all wrong you picked me up right off the ground was afraid to try and afraid i'd fall again crashing down from the sky you know had a hill to climb but with you my heart wont mend that's the one thing we all wanna know so if we ever fell in love would the wind blow would the pain go oh so if we ever fell in love oh oh oh i just wanna know i just wanna know tell me tell me so baby i just wanna know i just wanna know i just wanna know tell me tell me so baby i just wanna know i just wanna know i just wanna know tell me tell me so baby i just wanna know i just wanna know i just wanna know tell me tell me so baby i just wanna know so if we ever fell in love would the wind blow would the pain go oh yeah so if we ever fell in love oh oh oh so if we ever fell in love oh i wanna know what it feels like to be loved
