if he brings you happiness then i wish you both the best it's your happiness that matters most of all but if he ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start i'll be there before the next teardrop falls though it hurts to let you go darling i want you to know i'll stand by you if ever you should call and if i should ever hear that he's made you she'd a tear i'll be there before the next teardrop falls i'll be there anytime you need me by your side to dry away every teardrop that you've cried and if he ever leaves you blue just remember that i love you i'll be there before the next teardrop falls i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
