the sins of amsterdam were still a recent surprise and we were flying over scandinavian skies we climbed towards the sun we turned and cursed as one we pulled the shades and closed our eyes the stockholm city lights were slowly starting to rise and we were strapped against those scandinavian skies the landing gear came down and touched the swedish ground and we were all so paralyzed on the plane we were mainly sound and lights in the veins we could play the blues all night the tour of germany was bleeding into our eyes and we were sailing over scandinavian skies we had the midas touch until we met the dutch and they exhausted our supplies who's to pay for this international flight who could stay we were only there for the night we watched the power fall inside the olso hall while all the cold norweigians cried who could say what was left and where was right by the way i could play the blues all night
