oh by gosh by golly it's time for mistletoe and holly tasty pheasants christmas presents countrysides covered with snow oh by gosh by jingle it's time for carols and kris kringle overeating merry greetings from relatives you don't know then comes that big night giving the tree a trim you'll hear voices by starlight singing yuletide hollers oh by gosh by golly it's time for mistletoe and holly fancy ties and grandma's pies and folks stealing a kiss or two as they whisper merry christmas to you
