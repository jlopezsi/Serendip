oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling from glen to glen and down the mountain side the summer's gone and all the roses falling tis you tis you must go and i must bide but come you back when summer's in the meadow or all the valley's hushed and white with snow tis i'll be here in sunshine or in shadow oh danny boy oh danny boy i love you so but when you come when all the flowers are dying if i am dead as dead i well may be then if you bend and tell me that you love me i'll sleep in peace until you come to me but come ye back when summer's in the meadow or all the valley's hushed and white with snow tis i'll be here in sunshine or in shadow oh danny boy oh danny boy i love you so
