well it was all that i could do to keep from cryin sometimes it seemed so useless to remain but you don't have to call me darlin darlin you never even call me by my name you don't have to call me waylon jennings and you don't have to call me charley pride and you don't have to call me merle haggard anymore even though you're on my figtin side and i'll hang around as long as you will let me and i never minded standing in the rain but you don't have to call me darlin darlin you never even call me by my name well i've heard my name a few times in your phonebook hello hello and i've seen it on signs where i've played but the only time i know i'll hear david allan coe is when jesus has his final judgement day so i'll hang around well a friend of mine named steve goodman wrote that song and he told me it was the perfect country and western song i wrote him back a letter and told him it was not the percfect country and western song because he hadn't said anything at all about mama or trains or trucks or prison or gettin drunk well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me and after reading it i realized that my friend had written the perfect country and western song and i felt obliged to include it on this album the last verse goes like this here well i was drunk the day my mom got out of prison and i went to pick her up in the rain but before i could get to the station in a pickup truck she got run'd over by a damned old train and i'll hang around
