no one ever said that love was gonna be easy gotta take the ups and downs the in betweens if you take this journey gotta give yourself completely never let nobody ever step on a dream you better stop listen to these words i say you better stop don't you throw this good thing away no no put your trust in me and i'll make you see chorus no the rain won't last forever find a way to make it better long as we can stand together love will find a way gonna make a new tomorrow say good-bye to tears and sorrow better listen when i say love will find a way somebody tried to tell me love doesn't last forever said it only happens in your wildest dreams after all is said and done we're still here together never listen to the lies and jealousy you better stop don't you let them turn you around you better stop hang onto this love that we've found nothing ever say can stand in our way chorus
