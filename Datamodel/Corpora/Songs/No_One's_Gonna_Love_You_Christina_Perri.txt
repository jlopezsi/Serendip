originally by band of horses it's looking like a limb torn off or altogether just taken apart we're reeling through an endless fall we are the ever-living ghost of what once was but no one is ever gonna love you more than i do no one's gonna love you more than i do and anything to make you smile it's a better side of you to admire but they should never take so long just to be over then back to another one but no one is ever gonna love you more than i do no one's gonna love you more than i do but someone should have warned you when things start splitting at the seams and now the whole thing's tumbling down things start splitting at the seams and now if things start splitting at the seams and now it's tumbling down hard i did anything to make you smile you are the ever-living ghost of what once was i never want to hear you say that your better off or you liked it that way cos no one is ever gonna love you more than i do no one's gonna love you more than i do they really should have warned you when things start splitting at the seams and now the whole thing's tumbling down things start splitting at the seams and now if things start splitting at the seams and now it's tumbling down hard
