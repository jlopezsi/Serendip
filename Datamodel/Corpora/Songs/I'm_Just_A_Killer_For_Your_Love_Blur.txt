i heard a man who had no lungs he took me in and made me lunch he told me how i'd lost my friend he smiled at me it was the end i said i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love i cut my hair off in the road i take my coat off dropped my load i wipe my hands on the grass cause i know that nothing ever lasts and i said i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love i'm just a killer for your love
