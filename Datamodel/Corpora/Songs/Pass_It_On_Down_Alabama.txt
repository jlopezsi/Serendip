we live in the land of plenty but many things aren't plenty anymore like the water from our sink they say's not safe to drink you gotta go and buy it at the store now we're told there's a hole in the ozone look what's washing on the beach and lord i believe from the heavens to the seas we're bringing mother nature to her knees chorus so let's leave some blue up above us let's leave some green on the ground it's only ours to borrow let's save some for tomorrow leave it and pass it on down well there's a change taking place way on the mountains acid rain is falling on the leaves and down in brazil the fires are burning still how we gonna breathe without them trees chorus there's a place where i live called the canyon where daddy taught me to swim and that water it's so pure and i'm gonna make sure daddy's grandkids can swim there like him now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty when we look into the eyes of our kids cause brothers it's a fact if we take and don't put back they'll have to pay for all we did chorus x 4 tag leave it and pass it on down
