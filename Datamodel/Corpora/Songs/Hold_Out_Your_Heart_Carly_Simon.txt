oh my boy what have you done did you go out surfing on a frozen sea did you scare the livin daylights out of me did you go too far to drive away the demons did you go too far to know what love really means did you imagine it was more cause she went away first or did you force her hand to renew your thirst chorus well if you ever want an endless night or you need a moon and stars to shine just hold out your heart my darling hold out your heart my darling hold out your heart and i will give you some of mine oh my girl what have you done is it something we can't even talk about did you silence me remove me from your faith did you make me all but a stranger to your love did you look right through me below me and above did you try to ignore me make me all but lost did you cloud up the sky when you needed me most chorus it's gonna be fine it's gonna be fine just fine just hold out your heart my darling just hold out your heart my darling hold out your heart and i will give you all of mine
