saviour of the night came slowly on the silent river and the lord of life came following his sins to be forgiven while the world sat back and laughed away the hours till the dawning of the daybreak i heard them laugh i heard them cry i saw them praying to the sky i heard the wind howl in the trees down there on bended knee and i see the light but i know i must be dreaming feel the soul quiet emotion sail on by helpless devotion if that's how it feels it better be real take care of your woman or you'll never ever see the light take heed of the warnin or you know it's gonna be too late here there everywhere they keep on movin without fear they look me up they look me down they press my body to the ground but i see the light see the light it's comin shinin and on a summers day when thoughts are drifting far away and life is good and real to see my world is saved and i am free but in the night still i know i must be dreaming
