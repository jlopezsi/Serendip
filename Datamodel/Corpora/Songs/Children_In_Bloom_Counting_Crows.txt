children in bloom cooking in the sun waiting for a room of our own leave my sister alone she don't deserve this she is a flower and i am a flower and we are all alone i gotta get out on my own i gotta get up from this waiting at home i gotta get out of this sunlight it's melting my bones i gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home all these wasted dreams waiting for the sun to open up my heart to anyone bring me some rain because i'm dying and i can't get this damn thing closed again i gotta get out on my own i gotta get up from this waiting at home i gotta get out of this sunlight it's melting my bones i gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home where's the funhouse this year the fairground's deserted and the skies don't seem as near nicole's my oldest friend but the altar is empty and she'll never be a little girl again i gotta get out on my own i gotta get up from this waiting at home i gotta get out of this sunlight it's melting my bones i gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home i can't find my way home
