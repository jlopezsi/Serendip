how does it feel to be better how does it feel to be on your own oh tell me why did you take the time to tell me that you came to say goodbye everybody wants to laugh when you feel bad seems like the only way when the nights won't pass when you're so sad if you can't go back and you can't look down how does it feel to be better how does it feel to be on your own oh tell me why did you take the time to tell me that you came to say goodbye everything comes to mind it's a breakdown the way things seem to slide it's a free fall when you're so sad if you can't go back and you can't look down how does it feel to be better how does it feel to be on your own oh tell me why did you take the time walk away tell those lies why did you waste your time to tell me that you came to say goodbye
