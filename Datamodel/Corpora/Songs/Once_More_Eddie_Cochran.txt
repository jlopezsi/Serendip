if i could see you once more if i could touch you once more if i could tell you i need you once more once more to hold you near me once more and feel your kisses once more if i could share your love like i once did before no simple explanation can tell you how i feel i miss the old sensation that was once so warm and real please let me open the door to all we knew once before say you'll forgive me and love me once more
