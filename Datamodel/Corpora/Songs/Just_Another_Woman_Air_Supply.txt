just another woman in my life just another woman lost in the night just another woman keepin in touch with a man knock upon my window late at night making me believe that something's not right i look through the window but all i can see is the rain standing on my doorstep not very old looking so helpless and looking so cold a woman in need of some help most have lost her way she was tall she was lost she could smile and her words got crossed just another woman in my life just another woman lost in the night just another woman keepin in touch with a man as we sat by the fire the flame just grew talking about just the things we knew watching a new day arise outside my room the more i listened the more she told and in fascination my heart was sold weaving in and out of my mind with a skidder off now she was tall she was lost she could smile and her words got crossed just another woman in my life just another woman lost in the night just another woman keepin in touch with a man
