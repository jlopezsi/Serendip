a crowd made the magic happen the band made the music play i can close my eyes and see him there just like it was yesterday it was just another party till he walked in all alone and i read the message in his eyes it said honey i'll take ya home so i took him back to my place and i knew that he would stay and he held me and he loved me till we loved the night away chorus he was beautiful in the daylight of the morning sun his golden hair had come undone so beautiful he touched me with his fingertips he bended close i kissed his lips so beautiful it was easy for me to say goodbye watch him walk right out the door tellin myself i'd forget his face like all the other times before and i was halfway through the afternoon when i knew that i was wrong he was spinning around inside my head like some old familiar song so maybe some night while the music plays though i don't know where or when i'll be walking into some crowded room and i'll see his face again
