after all we said today the strangest thought occurred i feel i ought to tell you but it's clearly quite absurd wouldn't it be wonderful if you could read my mind imagine all the stuff that we could leave behind how many words you waste before you're understood or simply sow some seeds you'd do it if you could let me take a moment of your time inside you mind i know what you're thinking but i don't know what to say the turmoil and the conflict you don't have to feel that way look into my eyes and feel my hand upon your heart holding us together not tearing us apart how many words we waste to justify a crime compare it to an act of love that really takes no time why not take a moment of your time inside your mind
