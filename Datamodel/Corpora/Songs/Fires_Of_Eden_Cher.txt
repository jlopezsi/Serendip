it's not over til it's over i heard someone say must be a whisper in the wind cause you're too far away but in my restless sleep i could swear i saw you next to me saying oh i'm coming home you'll never spend another night alone chorus remember when love was innocent there was never a better time but you know those fires of eden still burn in this heart of mine the morning's uncertain it's a nervous day and i look for a reason why i should feel this way i hear a voice run before drifting through my open door saying it's alright we're going to light those flames tonight chorus and don't you wonder how we drifted so far when we belong to each other we were miles apart and there's a place that was meant for the two of us and when you touch the embers you feel my love as strong as it ever was chorus
