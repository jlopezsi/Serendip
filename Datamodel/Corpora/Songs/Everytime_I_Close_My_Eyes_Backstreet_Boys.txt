listen girl i don't know where to start cause every word i say is straight from the heart i've been so wrong i've never meant to hurt you oh girl i'm sorry of what i put you through girl i'd do anything for one more chance cause i want you back again chorus cause every time i close my eyes,i see your face and i wonder when you close your eyes do you think about me now i realize and i want you girl and no other and every time i close my eyes you're all that i see you and i we shared enough together each other was all we'd ever need i thought that you would stay with me forever but i took for granted the love you gave to me but i'll keep on trying till the end baby i need you back with me i need you back chorus and girl i'm going out of my mind i miss ya so much i don't know what to do please say its just a matter of time until i feel your touch until you let me come back to you i think about you girl every time at night i'm in love and it feels so right i never meant to hurt you or cause you pain i was just caught up in the lying game but now those days are over i've changed my ways now i'm counting the minutes i'm counting the days until you let me come back until you let me start to find a new way to get back into your heart chorus
