i look out my window into the pouring rain i wish i could tell you that i stopped hearing your name and then i realize every thought of you runs a circle around my heart i hear your voice haunting me i feel your touch in the dark it was a night to remember all your kisses i still taste it was a night to remember can't forget the look on your face it was a night starlight send a message like a beacon into the night to tell you i'm lonely when i shut out the light because a part of me left with you so i feel lost inside sometimes i look into my mirror i see you shining through my eyes it was a night to remember all your kisses i still taste it was a night to remember can't forget the look on your face it was a night to remember all these feelings i can't erase from my heart endless dreams around my shoulders i cannot free this restless heart it was a night to remember not enough time for you to stay can't forget the look on your face
