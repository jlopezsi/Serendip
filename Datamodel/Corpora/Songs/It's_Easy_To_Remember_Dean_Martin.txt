your sweet expression the smile you gave me the way you looked when we met it's easy to remember so hard to forget i hear you whisper i always love you i know it's over and yet it's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget so i must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight i'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night each little moment is clear before me and though it brings me regret it's easy to remember but so hard to forget so i must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight i'd rather dream than have that lonely old feeling stealing through the night each little moment is clear before me and though it brings me regret it's easy to remember and so hard to forget
