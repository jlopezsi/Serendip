what do you say to the dead will you forgive me for living can't believe the things that they said wonderful day for a killing it's killing me what do they do with your soul is it just lying there busted when did you lose all control is there someone to be trusted with my mind oh there's insufficient evidence of what just might come after but sometimes out of nowhere there's demented sounds of laughter are we all haunted by the ghost imagination it just can't be i've seen them there howling at the moon is it just me or does somebody else believe this well i'm not alone and i'm not afraid there's just one way to see chorus after all etc what do you say to the dead is there a place where it's burning it says in a book i once read yes there's a chance of returning turn to me the fundamental principles say nothing of forever but those are voices that i hear or i'm just not so clever it can't be me i know somebody else believes this well i'm not alone i'm not afraid just one way to see after all etc
