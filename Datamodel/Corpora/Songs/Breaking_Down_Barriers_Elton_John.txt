i recall how it used to be in my younger days i built a wall all around my heart to keep the pain away i built it tall and i built it wide i left no room for doubt your love still found its way inside and couldn't get back out i'm breaking down the barriers making up my mind i'm breaking down the barriers of time i'm taking down the barriers and loving what i find i'm breaking down the barriers that lie between your love and mine i guess you know you were not the first you may not be the last but you have shown me a better way and now i'm learning fast you gotta go where the feeling flows i take it while it's hot you gotta give if you want to get and i want all you got
