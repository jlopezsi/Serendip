you speak to me and in your words i hear a melody but in the twilight it's so hard to see what's wrong for me i can't resist until you give the truth a little twist as if you're gonna get away with this you're not sorry i can't believe i fell for this chorus i fell through the hole down at the bottom of your soul didn't think you could go so low look at what you done you're losing me is what you've won got me planning to go solo you sing to me too bad you couldn't even stay on key if your life is such a mystery why don't you just stick to acting oh here we go again you couldn't find my number until when you thought that you could get to my best friend without a script your game is lacking i can't believe i fell for this chorus i'd rather go to a party alone than have to walk around with you on my arm now that i'm better to admit that we're done good luck trying to find me down at the bottom of your soul didn't think you could go solo oh oh oh look at what you've done you're losing me here's what you've won got me planning to go solo now we're done oh oh cause you got me planning to go solo
