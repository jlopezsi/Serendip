i was a stranger in the city out of town where the people i knew i had the feeling of self-pity what to do what to do what to do the outlook was decidedly blue but as i walked through the foggy streets alone it turned out to be the luckiest day i've ever known a foggy day in a london town had me low and had me down i viewed the morning with alarm the british museum had lost its charm how long i wondered could this thing last but the age of miracles had'nt passed for suddenly i saw you there and through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere
