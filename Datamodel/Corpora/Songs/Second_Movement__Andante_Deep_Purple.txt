how can i see when the light is gone out how can i hear when you speak so silently more than enough is never too much hold out a hand i'm so out of touch do unto me as your heart would have you do words in my head can i get the message through sword in my hand can cut through the wood peace in my heart can soften the mood what shall i do when they stand smiling at me look at the floor and be oh so cool oh so cool how shall i know when to start singing my song what shall i do if they all go wrong what shall i do what shall i do when they stand laughing at me walk through the door and be oh so cool how shall i know when to stop singing my song what shall i do when it all goes wrong
