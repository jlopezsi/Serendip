can you keep a secret come on ohhhh these walls keep a secret that only we know but how long can they keep it cause we're two lovers who lose control we're two shadows chasing rainbows behind closed windows behind closed doors if walls could talk-oh they would say i want you more they would say hey never felt like this before and that you would always be the one for me just two people making memories too good to tell and these arms are never empty when we're lying where we fall we're painting pictures making magic taking chances making love if walls could talk-oh they would say i want you more they would say hey never felt like this before and that you would always be the one for me if walls had eyes my they would see the love inside they would see me in your arms in ecstasy and with every move they'd know i love you so when i'm feeling weak you give me wings when the fire has no heat you light it up again when i hear no violins you play my every string so stop the press hold the news the secret's safe between me and you walls can you keep a secret if calls could talk oh they would say i want you more they would say hey never felt like this before and that you would always be the one for me if walls had eyes my they would see the love inside they would see me in your arms in ecstasy and with every move they'd know i love you so
