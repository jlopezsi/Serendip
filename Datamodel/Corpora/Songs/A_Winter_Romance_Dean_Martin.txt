i never will forget the station where we met you dropped your skis a happy circumstance no one would have guessed we had started started a winter romance and all the way to maine on that enchanted train the passing scenery didn't get a glance we held hands completely light hearted off to a winter romance we danced that night by candle light the world was white with snow the way we felt we never felt the snow could melt and go but though the snow is gone the romance lingers on and those that said it didn't stand a chance will know when they see us together that love's not been controlled by the weather and all of our summers we'll have our winter romance though the snow is gone the romance lingers on and those that said it didn't stand a chance will know when they see us together that love's not been controlled by the weather and all of our summers we'll have our winter romance
