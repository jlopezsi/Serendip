you're so quiet but it doesn't faze me you're on time you move so fast makes me feel lazy let's join forces we've got our guns and horses i know you've been burned but every fire is a lesson learned i left my house left my clothes door wide open heaven knows you're so worth it you are but i wish i could feel it all for you i wish i could be it all for you if i could erase the pain then maybe you'd feel the same i'd do it all for you i would i would i would i would let's type words cause they amount to nothing play it down pretend you can't take what you found but you found me on a screen you sit at permanently i left my house left my clothes door wide open heaven knows you're so worth it you are but i wish i could feel it all for you i wish i could be it all for you if i could erase the pain then maybe you'd feel the same i'd do it all for you i would i would i would i would it's time to come clean and make sense of everything it's time that we found out who we are cause when i'm standing here in the dark i see your face in every star but i wish i could feel it all for you i wish i could be it all for you if i could erase the pain the maybe you'd feel the same i'd do it all for you i would i would i would i would i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you i'd do it all for you
