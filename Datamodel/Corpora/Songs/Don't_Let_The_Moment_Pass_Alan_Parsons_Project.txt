lead vocal marti webb this golden day will be mine for every moment in time if time should lose her way a symphony in the night of stars that dance in the light and music far away they say that love is but a dance don't let the music fade away don't let the moment pass without reason or rhyme the sweet bouquet of the wine will vanish in the air the innocence of the rose she leaves where she goes for all the world to share some days when clouds are drifting by i open my eyes and watch them go and wonder where they fly some nights orion runs too fast i look to the stars as if to say don't let the moment pass but soon a golden age is past just when it seemed that miracles where not too much to ask and though the world may turn too fast if it should seem like paradise don't let the moment pass
