you're the bravest of hearts you're the strongest of souls you're my light in the dark you're the place i call home you can say it's all right but i know that you're breaking up inside i see it in your eyes even you face the night afraid and alone that's why i'll be there when the storm rises up when the shadows descend every beat of my heart every day without end every second i live that's the promise i make baby that's what i'll give if that's what it takes if that's what it takes you can sleep in my arms you don't have to explain when your heart's crying out baby whisper my name cause i've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above you've given me your love when your smile like the sun that shines through the pain that's why i'll be there when the storm rises up when the shadows descend every beat of my heart every day without end i will stand like a rock i will bend till i break til there's no more to give if that's what it takes i will risk everything i will fight i will bleed i will lay down my life if that's what you need every second i live that's the promise i make baby that's what i'll give if that's what it takes through the wind and the rain through the smoke and the fire when the fear rises up when the wave's ever higher i will lay down my heart my body my soul i will hold on all night and never let go every second i live that's the promise i make baby that's what i'll give if that's what it takes if that's what it takes every day if that's what it takes every day
