oh holy night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of dear savior's birth long lay the world in sin and error pruning till he appeared and the soul felts its worth a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices oh night divine oh night when christ was born oh night divine oh night divine hallelujahs for the holy night
