if anything it should have been a better thing from underneath you staring at the ceiling it's another world of chocolate bars and baseball cards and it hides inside of all this tension that i'm feeling but it's all inside of you and it's all inside of you surprise surprise i miss your hair you miss my eyes and this solitude is my confidence eroding so we slide inside of someone's mouth and someone's eyes until there's a sound of something intimate exploding but it's all inside of you it's all inside of you i wish that i'd had anesthetized and sterilized and then i wouldn't have this evidence congealing surprise surprise another pair of lips and eyes and that's the consequence from actually feeling but it's all inside of you it's all inside of you
