nightwing has stirred and taken to flight the silence is over he's shattered the night no other hunter has the power or the grace he is the master of this place tell every creature of the night the kill is around the bend so listen my friend nightwing flies again they say he comes for those whose souls are weak and call his name upon the wind the night is cold and thick with mystery oh i can feel his beating wings tell every creature of the night the kill is around the bend nightwing flies again tell every creature of the night the kill is around the bend nightwing flies again nightwing has stirred and taken to flight the silence is over he's shattered the night life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free no soul will rest while the hunted run free so tell every creature of the night the kill is around the bend listen my friend nightwing flies again
