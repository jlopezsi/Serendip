hey hey hey hey in my rearview mirror my life is getting clearer the sunset sighs and slowly disappears these trinkets once were treasure life changes like the weather you grow up grow old or you hit the road round here so i drive drive drive watching white lines passing by with my plastic dashboard jesus waiting there to greet us chorus hey hey i finally found my way said goodbye to yesterday hit the gas there ain't no brakes on this lost highway yeah i'm busting loose i'm lettin go out on this open road it's independence day on this lost highway hey hey hey hey don't know where i'm going but i know where i've been i'm afraid of going back again so i drive drive drive years and miles are flying by and waiting there to greet us is my plastic dashboard jesus chorus oh patron saint of lonely souls tell this boy which way to go guide the car you've got the keys farewell to mediocrity kicking off the cruise control and turning up the radio got just enough religion and a half a tank of gas come on let's go i finally found my way said goodbye to yesterday hit the gas there ain't no brakes on this lost highway i'm busting loose i'm lettin go when i'm out on this open road it's independence day on this lost highway hey hey hey hey hey hey on this lost highway
