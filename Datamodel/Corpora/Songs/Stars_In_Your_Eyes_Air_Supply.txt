we are civilized and free from all confusion and yet we always worry for the things that we can't see but now to give your love away a miracle in motion you know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me i start to lose control i start to lose control chorus i know i will remember for longer than forever all the love and the stars in your eyes until my arms surround you and build the world around you all i see are the stars in your eyes first you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven you know what you've found you want to last forever you heart has found its wings and left for never never and then i lose control i start to lose control chorus i know i will remember for longer than forever all the love and the stars in your eyes chorus repeat
