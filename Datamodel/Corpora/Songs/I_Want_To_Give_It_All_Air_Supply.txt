here i am again i've come to see you smile i know you understand i have to say again it's only for awhile and still you're always here just waiting for my call i wish i knew a way to give more than i do i want to give it all chorus it doesn't happen every day but it happened to me once before those early years i threw away now i only have to hear your voice to make me feel so sure that your love is why i want to give it all don't the minutes fly and hours just seem so few with days apart so long it's hard to spend my time when i'm so far from you and still you're always there just waiting for my call i wish i knew a way to give more than i do i want to give it all
