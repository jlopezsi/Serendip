it was the mortal passion the flame that lit the fire the beauty of the starlight brought the cruelty of desire a lover's link was broken another's vengeful plan was contrived through jealous hatred for a cross of god and man i hope it will turn out so but i can't help being afraid perception is hindered by lust to be sure of the choice you have made grant me this request please just promise me your word attest to the mighty river let the truth be heard she asked to see the power his realm of life and love his godly immortality the thunder roared above her words were so quickly spoken lest he stop her from the deed i gave you my word now my love your grim request i shall heed leaving his maiden he rose to the sky returning in splendors to earth he did fly subject to presence too brilliant to face another had killed passion's grace
