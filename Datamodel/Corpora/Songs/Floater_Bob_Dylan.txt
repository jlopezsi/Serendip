down over the window from the dazzling sunlit rays through the back alleys through the blinds another one of them endless days honey bees are buzzing leaves begin to stir i'm in love with my second cousin i tell myself i could be happy forever with her i keep listening for footsteps but i ain't never hearing any from the boat i fish for bullheads i catch a lot sometimes too many a summer breeze is blowin a squall is setting in sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind well the old men round here sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men old young age don't carry weight it doesn't matter in the end one of the boss hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect tryin to bully you strongarm you inspire you with fear it has the opposite effect there's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town the old one is long gone 10 foot 2 foot 6 across burns with the bark still on they say times are hard if you don't believe it you can follow your nose it don't bother me times are hard anywhere we'll just have to see how it goes my old man he's like some feudal lord he's got more lives than a cat i've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once things come alive or they fall flat you can smell the pine wood burnin you can hear the school bell ring got to get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything romeo he said to juliet you got a poor complexion it don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch juliet said back to romeo why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much they got outta here any way they could cold rain can give you the shivers they went down the ohio the cumberland the tennessee all the rest of them rebel rivers if you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again you do so at the peril of your life i'm not quite as cool or forgiving as i sound i've seen enough heartache and strife my grandfather was a duck trapper he could do it with just dragnets and ropes my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth i don't know if they had any dreams or hopes i had em once though i suppose to go along with all the ring dancing christmas carols and all the christmas eves i left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves not always easy kicking someone up got to wait awhile it can be an unpleasant task sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and tears or not it's too much to ask
