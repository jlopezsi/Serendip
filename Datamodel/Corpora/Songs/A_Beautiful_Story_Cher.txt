what's your name is it jane would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool it's just i tired of wasting my hours talking to trees and watching flowers grow watching birds chasing bees little boys scraping knees even my tears have all dried can i sit by your side chorus don't misunderstand me i'm just an old man with no place to go and if you oblige me and sit here beside me i'll tell you a story a beautiful story that you might not know please don't go pardon me mister tree i hope i didn't offend you before you are my friend but i wanted much more but now i'm back once again like always before watching birds chasing bees little boys scraping knees even my tears have all dried can i sit by your side chorus
