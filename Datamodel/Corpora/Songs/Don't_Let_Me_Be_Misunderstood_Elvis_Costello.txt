baby can you understand me now sometimes i feel a little mad don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel when things go wrong i seem to be mad chorus i'm just a soul whose intentions are good oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood baby sometimes i'm so carefree with a joy that's hard to hide other times it seems that all i have to do is worry and then i know you're bound to see my other side chorus if i get mad at you i want you to know that i never mean to take it out on you life has its problems and i get my share but that is one thing i would never do cause i love you oh don't you know i'm human i've got my faults just like any one sometimes i lie awake long regretting some foolish thing some sinful thing i've done chorus:x3
