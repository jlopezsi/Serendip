the sun brings up another day near the little fishin town the nets are hung out in the wind the sails are down a seagull flies above my head spinning slowly towards the sea he seems so free and just like me he rides the wind chorus i'm a travelin man nothin left behind me but the road i'm a travelin man won't you share the load lonesome shepherd in the field ahead moonlight flows across the grass the rocky hills catch the light above their shadows cast lonely by the day drifting late at night the wind is creepin through my ragged coat what a life chorus
