chorus more-i don't know how to more-i die without you more-and i would stop the world turning i stop the sun burning but i can't love you more more-is there more than a lifetime more-count the stars in the nighttime more-i'm already your slave love that's what i gave love and i can't love you more every breath that i take my first thought when i wake every song i hear how i feel when you're near how i feel by your side how i'm glad i'm alive whether winter or spring doesn't mean anything how my home's anywhere knowing that i know you care and how nothing i see beyond you and me chorus
