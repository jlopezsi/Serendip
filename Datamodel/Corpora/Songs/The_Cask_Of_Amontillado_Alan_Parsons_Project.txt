by the last breath of the four winds that blow i'll have revenge upon fortunato smile in his face i'll say come let us go i've a cask of amontillado sheltered inside from the cold of the snow follow me now to the vault down below drinking the wine as we laugh at the time which is passing incredibly slow what are these chains that are binding my arm part of you dies each passing day say it's a game and i'll come to no harm you'll feel your life slipping away you who are rich and whose troubles are few may come around to see my point of view what price the crown of a king on his throne when you're chained in the dark all alone spare me my life only name your reward part of you dies each brick i lay bring back some light in the name of the lord you'll feel your mind slipping away
