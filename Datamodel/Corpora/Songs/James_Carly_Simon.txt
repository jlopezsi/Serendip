james your voice is like the water when i lift this shell to my ear i can hear you pourin out your heart to me james the beauty of your voice lifts us from sadness james let us become like water together sing to me sit on the edge of my bed as when we first spent nights together your body wrapped around your guitar let the music speak for your heart let them combine like water and sand let them meet the air like drops of rain and bring us together once again
