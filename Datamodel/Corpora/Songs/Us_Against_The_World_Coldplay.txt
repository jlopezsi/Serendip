oh morning come bursting the clouds amen lift off this blindfold let me see again bring back the water let your ships roll in in my heart she left a hole the tightrope that i'm walking just sways and ties the devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes and i just want to be there when the lightning strikes and the saints go marching in and sing slow it down through chaos as it swirls it's us against the world like a river to a raindrop i lost a friend my drunken as a daniel in a lion's den and tonight i know it all has to begin again so whatever you do don't let go and if we could float away fly up to the surface and just start again and lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain just erodes us in the rain just erodes us and see roses in the rain sing slow it down slow it down through chaos as it swirls it's us against the world through chaos as it swirls it's us against the world
