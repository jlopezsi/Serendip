watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror as i drive away wishing that i could take back all those words that meant nothing that i didn't say i'm trying to be what you want me to be but it's so damn hard to keep playing the part of the fool week after week i think you need some time alone i think you need some time alone you say you want someone to call your own open your eyes you can suck in your pride you can live your life all on your own is this all going to be just another time that we play this game i've tried to convince you that things could be different but somehow they end up the same but what did you expect from me what am i supposed to do you say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost well i do too i don't wanna live this lie again i don't wanna live this lie again i know i'll get it right but i don't know when i'll open my eyes i've got something in side i'll just jack off in my room until then it's never over til it's done and i don't think that you're the one it's never over til it's done and i don't think that you're the one
