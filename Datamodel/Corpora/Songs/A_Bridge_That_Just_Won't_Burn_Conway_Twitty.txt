a bridge that just won't burn i threw away the pictures of those better days in dallas but i can't throw away these pictures in my mind she's a page of precious memories i've tried hard to turn she's standing on a bridge that just won't burn if only time will heal the hurt then this may last forever i may never know how it feels to forget every time i think about her those old feelings still return she's standing on a bridge that just won't burn i've burned a lot of bridges in my time but the one i just crossed over it ain't the burning kind she's that once in a lifetime kind of love that never will return she's standing on a bridge that just won't burn she's standing on a bridge that just won't burn
