i refuse to be amused that's sumthin that ain't right i declare i'm well aware i felt the angel's vibes i can hear ya callin no i'm not stallin i'm justa doin sumthin else when i'm with you i'm really with you but right now i'm by myself and i chorus i can feel this fire such a strange desire as strong as life itself i i can feel this fire such a strange desire and i don't want nothin else but ooh i like your lovin talk so much i'm in a flux ya just can't make up your mind executin dreams ain't easy justa wastin precious time talk is cheap your words are weak i don't want you wastin mine i hear ya callin no i'm not stallin i'm justa doin sumthin else when we're together sho nuff together right now i'm by myself and i repeat chorus ad lib to fade
