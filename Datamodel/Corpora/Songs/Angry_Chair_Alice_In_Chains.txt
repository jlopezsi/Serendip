sitting on an angry chair angry walls that steal the air stomach hurts and i don't care what do i see across the way hey see myself molded in clay oh stares at me yeah i'm afraid heeey changing the shape of his face ooh yeah candles red i have a pair shadows dancing everywhere burning on the angry chair little boy made a mistake hey pink cloud has now turned to gray oh all that i want is to play hey get on your knees time to pray oh i don't mind yeah i don't mind aaah i don't mind yeah i don't mind aaah lost my mind yeah i don't mind aaah can't find it anywhere i don't mind aaah corporate prison we stay hey i'm a dull boy work all day ooh so i'm strung out anyway heey guitar solo loneliness is not a phase field of pain is where i graze serenity is far away saw my reflection and cried heey so little hope that i died oh feed me your lies open wide heey weight of my heart not the size oh i don't mind yeah i don't mind aaah i don't mind yeah i don't mind aaah lost my mind yeah i don't mind can't find it anywhere i don't mind aaah pink cloud has now turned to gray all that i want is to play get on your knees time to pray boy
