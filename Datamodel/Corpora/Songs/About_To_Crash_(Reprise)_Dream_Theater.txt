i'm alive again darkness far behind me i'm invincible despair will never find me i feel strong i've got a new sense of elation boundless energy euphoria fixation still talk to just get by seems so meaningless to try when all i want to do is cry who would ever know i felt so sad cause even though i get so high i know that i will never fly and when i fall out of the sky who'll be standing by will you be standing by
