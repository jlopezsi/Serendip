first came the winter and then came the morning bright coral branches that pass you again down from the meadow and onto the seashore came the vast checkerboard kingdom of men sun radiates gold infrarays time to prepare for the fall harvest the corn watch for the storm soon we will hear winter call ice on the pond won't stay too long too thin to walk it today ice on the pond something went wrong frost must be lost on the way evening is falling the tree is a silhouette as seen by the teddy bear watching his den spring came so quickly that i did not see her just turn around and she's coming again wind chimes along rising at dawn seasons in circles too match each comes along singing his song burying thoughts of the past
