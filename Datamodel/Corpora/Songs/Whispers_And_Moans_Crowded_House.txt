dull dull grey the colour of our times cool cool space that i still hope to find far beyond the veil the sound of whispers and moans slow time bomb the clamour of the street i hear this town it never goes to sleep and i will catch the taxi driver weeping like a wounded beast then i wake up in your room to share one piece of your life when tomorrow comes we may not be here at all without your whispers and moans cause here you come to carry me home here you come to carry me home love that sound time erase tension wheels cool heels won't ya come on open the bid fore too long then i wake up in your room to share one piece of your life i'd give anything to be a fly upon the wall and hear your whispers and moans i'd like to hear your whispers and moans here you come to carry me we are the mirrors are the mirrors of each other in a lifetime of suspicion cleansed in a moment of recognition you gave your life for it worth it's weight in gold and growing empires and art collectors and alan's sound investments will one day be forgotten one day be forgotten yeah
