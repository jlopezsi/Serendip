a certain type of wind has swept me up but till it's found each bone i i'm overcome there is an icy breath that escapes my lips and i am lost again a certain type of darkness is stalling me under a quite mask of uncertainty i wait for light like water from the sky and i am lost again in the sea of lovers without ships and lovers without sign you're the only way out of this sea of lovers losing time and lovers losing hope will you let me follow you wherever you go bring me home a certain type of silence's filled my voice a scream beneath the water make no noise all my prayers go quiet and never heard and i am lost again in the sea of lovers without ships and lovers without sign you're the only way out of this sea of lovers losing time and lovers losing hope will you let me follow you wherever you go bring me home a certain type of wind has swept me up but till it's found each bone i i'm overcome there is an icy breath that escapes my lips and i am lost again in the sea of lovers without ships and lovers without sign you're the only way out of this sea of lovers losing time and lovers losing hope you're the only way out of this sea of lovers without ships and lovers without sign you're the only way out of this sea of lovers losing time and lovers losing hope will you let me follow you wherever you go bring me home
