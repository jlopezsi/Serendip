candles burning glasses are chilled and soon she'll be by hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try and if all these plans i made don't melt the lady's heart i'll put on the old forty-fives and maybe the old songs will bring back the old times maybe the old lines will sound new maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder maybe old feelings will some through maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away maybe the old songs will bring back the old times and make her want to stay oh oh it's been too long without seeing her face light up when i come home been to many hours i've waited staring at the phone sweet old songs i'm counting on you bring her back to me i'm tired of listening alone maybe the old songs will bring back the old times maybe the old lines will sound new maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder maybe old feelings will some through maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away maybe the old songs will bring back the old times and make her want to stay oh oh and make her want to stay
