looking for a lady i'm looking for a lady to change my night to day looking for a lady i'm looking for a lady to chase my blues away well i have a few in mind but none in particular i have had them before but nothing that was for sure and i'm in no position to barter and i'm in no condition to play the martyr and i'm sadder certainly but i'm smarter and i find myself looking for a lady i'm looking for a lady to share my empty bed looking for a lady i'm looking for a lady to soothe my aching head well i have a few in mind but none in particular i have had them before but nothing that was for sure and my feelings have grown rigid like a wooden post and my love is like a curtain that has been drawn closed and my life just isn't going the way i thought it was supposed to and i'm crying and i find myself looking for a lady i'm looking for a lady to change my night to day
