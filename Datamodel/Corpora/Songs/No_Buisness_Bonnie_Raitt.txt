yes i'm lonely hope you didn't catch it don't want to be down where i last behaved i broke his heart now i can't patch it this time it's grave i kept track of all the love that i gave him and on paper well it looked pretty good he left a note that said he couldn't stay here as if i could i guess my love's got no business no business calling his name i guess my love's got no business nobody to blame one of these days i thought we'd get it together after all that boy was made for me but all he left me was a mouth full of feathers little bird got free he always said my love was one sided i tried to keep up with supply and demand but there was one way that pie was divided it was a big piece plan i guess my love's got no business no business calling his name i guess my love's got no business nobody to blame well now i'm getting desperate baby getting illeagal i got the law doggies on my trail the hawk's out and i could use an eagle to go my bail you say you're itching baby so go ahead and scratch it but if it jumps off don't look at me you swore to god that i couldn't catch it but your dog's got fleas i guess my love's got no business no business calling his name i guess my love's got no business nobody to blame
