if you could read my mind love what a tale my thoughts could tell just like an old time movie bout a ghost from a wishing well in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet you know that ghost is me and i will never be set free as long as i am a ghost that you can see if i could read your mind love what a tale your thoughts could tell just like a paperback novel that kind the drugstores sell when you reach the part where the heartaches come the hero would be me the heroes often fail and you won't red that book again because the ending's just too hard to take i'd walk away like a movie star who gets spurned in a three-way script ends up number two the movie queen to play the scene and bringing all the good things out in me but now for love lets be real i never thought i could feel this way and i got to say that i just don't get it i don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and i just can't get it back if you could read my mind love what a tale my thoughts could tell just like an old time movie bout a ghost from a wishing well in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet stories always end and if you read between the lines you know that i'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack i've never thought i could feel this way and i've got to say that i just don't get it i don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and i just can't get it back
