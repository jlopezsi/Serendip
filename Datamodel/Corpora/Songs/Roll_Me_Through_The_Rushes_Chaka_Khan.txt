chorus roll me through the rushes like moses roll me through the rushes just like moses roll me through the rushes like moses guide me to the new woman who waits current leave me on the banks by the cottage where we will dine with silver cups and golden plates chorus i've prepared for my last journey you know i've worked all my life to make this basket strong but a woman alone on a river she can't stay in the water too long i've been chilled i've lost my will and i've stayed away from rivers much too long i really must stay in this dirty dirty city till i found out that my strength was gone chorus just like moses make my journey make it short in space let me lose this hardness that i got now lord water wash away all traces of hate i will do what you say if you just show me how river chorus roll me through the rushes like moses roll me through the rushes just like moses on the nile river river sail repeat x4
