inside your plastic head you make decisions upon her lemon world they fall forever break the chains that tie you to the ground and bring you too knees shake the chains that tie you to the earth shake the chains shake the chains upon her willow hair the sun relaxes she's watched all tidal waves away from your disaster break the chains that tie you to the ground and bind you to your mother she will bind up your hands bind up your legs bind up your heart and hold you down till you say your sorry she's been waiting for you forever now and now someone else's chapstick on your lips to hide your cheery lies you make excuses in between each lemon breath she smiles and swallows your abuses shake the chains that tie you to the ground and bind you to your mother she will bind up your hands bind up your legs bind up your heart and hold you down till you say your sorry she's been waiting for you forever now and now someone else's chapstick on your lips say your hungry she's lying for you forever now and now someone put sorry in her hand nonononon say your sorry she's been waiting waiting inside your plastic head in between your laughter you drowned in memory storms that fall forever after she's someone else's lipstick now she's someone else's matchstick now she's someone else's witchcraft now she's someone else's chapstick now now now
