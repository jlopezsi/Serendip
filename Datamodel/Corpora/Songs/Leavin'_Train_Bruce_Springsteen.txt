when i asked you if everything is alright you whisper don't worry and you shut out the light now black is black in this bed we're laying and i want to believe the words that you're saying chorus but your eyes look like a leavin train they keep on dragging me down your eyes look like a leavin train they keep on draggin they keep on draggin they keep on draggin me down well i did anything just to try to get close to you i took it step by step like a man's supposed to tell me now is this my is this my contrition to have the love that i longed for fill me with suspicion chorus now it's tellin time oh my little sister now can i believe the words the words of love you whisper is my train in vain has my soul gone to waste am i just a victim of a victim of my lost faith chorus
