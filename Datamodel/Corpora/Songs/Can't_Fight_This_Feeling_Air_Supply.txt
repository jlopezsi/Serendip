i can't fight this feeling any longer and yet i'm still afraid to let it flow what started out as friendship has grown stronger i only wish i had the strength to let it show i tell myself that i can't hold out forever i say there is no reason for my fear cause i feel so secure when we're together you give my life direction you make everything so clear and even as i wonder i'm keeping you in sight you're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might and i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever cause i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through your door baby i can't fight this feeling anymore my life has been such a whirlwind since i saw you i've been running around in circles in my mind baby it always seems that i'm following you cause you take me to the places that alone i'd never find and even as i wonder i'm keeping you sight you're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might and i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever cause i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through your door baby i can't fight this feeling anymore
