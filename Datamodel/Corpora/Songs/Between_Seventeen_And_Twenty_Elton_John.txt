i wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight whose head rests upon the bed could it be a close friend i knew so well who seems to be so close to you instead close to you instead i'm blue tonight i'm red when i'm mad i'm green when i'm jealous yellow when i'm sad i guess i cannot have everything so much has flown between the years when i was twenty and you were seventeen so out of choice i chose rock and roll but it pushed me to the limit everyday it turned me into a gypsy kept me away from home from there on there seemed no use for you for you to stay and if i shower around 3 a.m it's just to wash away the trace of a love unwanted oh in the times i went astray the times i went astray so much has flown between the years when i was twenty and you were seventeen
