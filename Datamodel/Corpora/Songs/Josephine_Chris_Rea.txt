there's rain on my window but i'm thinking of you tears on my pillow but i will come through josephine i'll send you all my love and every single step i take i take for you josephine there's a storm on my radar but i can still fly and you are the reason the blue in my sky josephine a life without meaning i was walking away in the coldest of winters night becomes day josephine i'll send you all my love and every single step i take i take for you josephine
