i watch the snow flakes fall against my window pane and wonder if you are watching snow flakes too i take a walk downtown to where you used to meet me theres joy everywhere but all that's waiting there is just a little christmas tree lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me noone seems to care they just went away and left it standing there all alone on christmas eve i hear the christmas bell the happy people singing the songs of good cheer that only brings me tears i sadly close my eyes and say a little prayer you'll be waiting there for me i look but all i see is just a little christmas tree lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me noone seems to care they just went away and left it standing there all alone on christmas eve this is the season of love but i'm as sad as i can be why did you have to leave me oh little christmas tree lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me noone seems to care they just went away and left it standing there all alone on christmas eve
