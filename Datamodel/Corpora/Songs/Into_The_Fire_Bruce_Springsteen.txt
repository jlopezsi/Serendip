the sky was falling and streaked with blood i heard you calling me then you disappeared into the dust up the stairs into the fire up the stairs into the fire i need your kiss but love and duty called you someplace higher somewhere up the stairs into the fire may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love give us love may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love bring us love you gave your love to see in fields of red and autumn brown you gave your love to me and lay your young body down up the stairs into the fire up the stairs into the fire i need you near but love and duty called you someplace higher somewhere up the stairs into the fire may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love give us love may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love bring us love may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love bring us love it was dark too dark to see you held me in the light you gave you lay your hand on me then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave up the stairs into the fire up the stairs into the fire i need your kiss but love and duty called you someplace higher somewhere up the stairs into the fire may your strength give us strength may your faith give us faith may your hope give us hope may your love bring us love may your love bring us love
