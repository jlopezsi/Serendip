all i can be is a sweet memory that drifts through your mind from time to time i could never be more than a knock on your door just a shadow that's gone with the sunshine for you know i'm not free and i never can be and you're bound to get restless in time all i can be is a sweet memory that drifts through your mind tonight i'll she'd a silent tear while lying here with you the sands of time have trickled down to just a precious few you're young and so beautiful and i'm so glad i'm here but the ending painfully clear all i can be is a sweet memory of someone you had to leave behind who loves you and needs you but never could give you a ring for your finger so fine so tonight let's just borrow one memory for tomorrow til we find we've run out of time all i can be is a sweet memory that drifts through your mind all i can be is a sweet memory that drifts through your mind
