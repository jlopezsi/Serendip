this is the garden that i know ten thousand summers wait me here you lead and i will follow your heart is mine tomorrow into your womb i fade away and while she laughs your pride is turning into snow and melting on the face of this light of hope shine on light of hope light of hope and while she laughs your pride is turning into snow and dancing on the graves of what you thought you used to know and in this garden i will burn my callous robes and forever love my darling light of hope
