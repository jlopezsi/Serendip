i can't run in your eyes there's no place left to hide you've seen my every mystery just show itself and die so i will fly before you and all is all to see take my hand understand there're no more foolish dreams so many things we just can't share are standing in between so i will fly before you and all is all to see i will always want you near in the shallow lights of day no-one else will share my nights is all that i can say and i will always want you but i will always fly like a seabird and i will always love you but i will always fly
