every night seems dinner and wine saturdays girls i was never in love never had the time in my hustle and hurried world laughing my self to sleep waking up lonely i need someone to hold me oh it's such a crazy home town it can drag you down till you run out of dreams so you party all night to the music and lights but you don't what happiness means i was dancing in the dark with strangers no love around me when suddenly you found me oh girl you're every woman in the world to me you're my fantasy you're my reality girl you're every woman in the world to me you're everything i need you're everything to me oh girl everything good everything fine that's what you are so put your hand in mine and together we'll climb as high as the highest star i'm living the life time in every minute that we're together and i'm staying right here forever oh girl you're every woman in the world to me you're my fantasy you're my reality girl you're every woman in the world to me you're everything i need you're everything to me oh girl
