i know people who lose their lover turn around and they find another fall in love and then they break up i don't know if i want to wake up cause i'm still dreamin i'm still dreamin baby i'm still dreamin oh oh oh about you other women walk right up to me i hear them talking but it goes right through me i know it's love that's on the line but they don't know what's on my mind cause i'm still dreamin it's like a voice that's always calling it's like a feelin that i'm always falling i close my eyes and all i see is you you you cause i'm still dreamin i'm still dreamin
