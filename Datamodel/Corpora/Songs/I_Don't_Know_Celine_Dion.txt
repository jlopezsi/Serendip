a mountain of stone a door of steel can't stand in my way i'd go on brutal machines unbending laws can't slow me down i'd go on i've learned how to deal and when to fight i know what's real i know what's right i'm not afraid a wounded dove i can be tender in a world so tough i'm sure i could face the bitter cold but life without you i don't know the winds of the heart can blow me down but i get right up and i stand my ground i've tasted fear my share of pain the wasted tears of love in vain i've held you tight pushed you away now with all my might i beg you to stay i'm sure i could face the bitter cold but life without you i don't know i know what i want i know what i need but there's just one thing i must believe deep in the night by a dying flame you will be there when i call your name i'm sure i could face the bitter cold but life without you i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know
