verse 1 o holy night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of our dear savior's birth long lay the world in sin and ever pining til he appeared and the spirit felt its worth a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn chorus fall on your knees o hear the angel voices o night divine o the night when christ was born o holy night the stars are brightly shining verse 2 truly he taught us to love one another his law is love and his gospel is peace chains he shall break for the slave is our brother and in his name all oppression shall cease o the world the star is sweetly gleaming sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we chorus fall on your knees o hear the angel voices o night divine o the night when christ was born o night divine outro o the night when christ was born when christ was born when christ was born
