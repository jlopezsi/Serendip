in this day and age where changes happen twice as fast sometimes i get wonderin if anything will last people changin partners like they change their underwear maybe i'm old-fashioned but darlin i still care chorus and i'm yours for life come and be my lifetime come and take the love i have for only one yes i'm yours for life come and share my lifetime share the world until our day is done time that i first saw your face i loved you where you stood in your eyes a kindness told me you were good and if the world could share your heart there'd never be a war and darlin if i tried and tried i could not love you more chorus sometime i pray that you will always be the way you always are to me cause if i lost you to the winds of change then i would cease to be
