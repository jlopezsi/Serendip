standing in a field of three leaf clovers waiting for the rain to pass over no rainbows on my shoulder just the weight of walking day to day nothing shiny coming along the way then i saw you and i reached out ain't no more blue now i understand why how lucky i am lucky i am to be the one who fills your eyes blowin away sails on a lake flyin like a flag in the sky bright colored balloons in the wind that's how lucky i am how lucky i am now the road is rising up to meet me and my half empty cup is filled completely and i'm drinking that sweet taste of rain so grateful for each moment i get to have found you i could have walked on by but the stars were on my side
