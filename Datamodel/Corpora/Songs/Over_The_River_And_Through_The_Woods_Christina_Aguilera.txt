over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house we go the horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through white and drifted snow over the river and through the woods oh how the wind does blow it stings the toes and bites the nose as over the ground we go over the river and through the woods to have a full day of play oh hear the bells ringing ting-a-ling-ling for it is christmas day over the river and through the woods trot fast my dapple gray spring o'er the ground just like a hound for this is christmas day over the river and through the woods and straight through the barnyard gate it seems that we go so dreadfully slow it is so hard to wait over the river and through the woods now grandma's cap i spy hurrah for fun the pudding's done hurrah for the pumpkin pie
