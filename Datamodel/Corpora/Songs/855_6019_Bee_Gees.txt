i've discovered for myself this time the start of everything to me is to know our love is older than the sea but don't let another flame inside your fire-proof heart cause i'm not your full-time lover and it's tearing me apart i've been hangin on this line too long 855-7019 don't you ever answer 855-7019 don't you hear the word search for a sign baby she was the past and the future i just got burned 855-7019 is a private number i know in your mind that you think it's a crime but i had to call first and last there will never be a past or a future if you kill my phone baby lifts her eyes and i'm a slave to all the lies and i'm forever lost i believe in you and me together and it keeps this love alive 855-7019 don't you ever answer 855-7019 don't you hear the word search for the sign baby she was the past and the future i just got burned i have suffered for my sins today with the pain of love before the dawning comes the darker is the night i'm born to be the one to share your life that shows i don't need no operator i don't want no one to know how much i need you 855-7019 don't you ever answer i know in your mind that you think it's a crime but i had to call first and the last there will never be a past or a future if you kill my phone baby lifts her eyes and i'm a slave to all the lies and i'm forever lost i believe in you and me together and it keeps this love alive
