in the middle of the night i had a vision it was bigger than life standing on the edge of my bed she said come here don't be afraid her tongue opened like a shot oh bang bang ten feet tall laser eyes killer body killer thighs she drew me a fine line what's wrong what's right i didn't know what to think she seemed to know what to drink i was stunned by her gun couldn't walk couldn't run well she drew me a picture and it seemed so true standing on the edge and watching my life flash by standing on the edge she's lookin right through my eyes love is passin by right before my eyes and i'm wondering why what's the reason that i'm standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge right here in my face i had a vision that was bigger than life oh connie likes nighttime every night connie likes candy every bite all day sucker connie might swallow that thing cause she does it right i'm weak in the knees i'm beggin you please just ask for more she just wants affection my soldier's at attention no i don't know why you're doin this to me standing on the edge and watching my life flash by standing on the edge she's lookin right through my eyes love is passin by right before my eyes and i'm wondering why what's the reason that i'm standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge well she told me in the biblical sense and she told me in the strictest confidence she told me we were worlds apart she told me she told me i don't know why i'm here she said don't be afraid standing on the edge and watching my life flash by standing on the edge you're lookin right through my eyes standing on the edge light flashes before my eyes standing on the edge and watchin my world crash by love is passing by right before my eyes and i wonder why what's the reason that i'm standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge standing on the edge i'm standing on the edge
