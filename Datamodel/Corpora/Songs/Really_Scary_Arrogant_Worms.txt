it's the most frightening thing in the world it's the scariest sight i've ever seen the most chilling visual the most terrifying scene it's awful it's crappy it's monstrous it's bad it's really really huge it's a fat man in a speedo i'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle hoping to enjoy the sand and surf when i see a mound of baby-oiled flesh rolling and a broiling in the foam the only thing that's holding this explosion of caucasian is a tiny red synthetic coloured thread i try to sink it in the sand and entomb it in a castle but it always manages to break free the fat man in a speedo i'm having nightmares i'm scared to open my eyes i try to free myself by going to the buffet but there he is he even eats in his speedo i take up a collection at the bar the next day and everybody gives to the cause to rent a helicopter that will take this whale to cuba and free the horizon from his bulk we have a celebration in one of his indentations and throw a bowl of jello in the air we think we've escaped and our scenery is clear but in comes a plane from germany thirty fat german men wearing speedos
