words and music by bob seger there's a highway a lonesome stretch of gray it runs between us and takes me far away out in the distance always within reach there's a crossroad where all the victims meet i close my eyes and see her face it's all i want to see and deep inside it still amazes me even now she's all that i want she's all that i need even now she's givin it all she's givin it free even now when everything's right when everything's wrong even now she's keepin me straight she's keepin me strong she gets to me somehow even now and through the darkness through all the endless days through all the changes the pointless one act plays i can still make it i can still stand tall cause i've got my girl to get me through it all through all the doubt and all the fear and all that i can't say still somehow she'll help me find my way even now she's still in my heart she's still in my soul even now she's still on my mind wherever i go even now through all of my days and all of my nights even now she's keepin it real she's keepin it right she gets to me somehow even now she's all that i want she's all that i need even now she's givin it all she's givin it free when everything's right when everything's wrong she's keepin it real she's keepin it strong even now
