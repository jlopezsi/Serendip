you can take a powder you can take a drink you can keep the shrink and the kitchen sink write my name in heaven in invisible ink i just woke up from dreaming i think you can take me over you can give me a lip you can take me under you can give me the slip take off everything or tear me off a strip like a lady in the chamber and another in the clip chorus don't move a muscle baby don't even flinch you can miss me by a mile or just inch by inch inch by inch inch by inch inch by inch you can pull me up again inch by inch inch by inch as pulses race i long to see that look upon your face you can take me outside you can take me apart you can take me upstairs you can take me to heart you made me love you when you thought you were so smart don't try to stop me when you told me to start chorus
