all that i did was walk over start off by shaking your hands that's how it went i had a smile on my face and i sat up straight oh yeah yeah i wanted to know you i wanted to show you chorus you don't know me don't ignore me you don't want me there you just shut me out you don't know me don't ignore me if you had your way you'd just shut me up make me go away no i just don't understand why you won't talk to me it's hurts that i'm so unwanted for nothing don't talk words against me i wanted to know you i wanted to show you chorus make me go away i tried to belong it didn't seem wrong my head aches its been so long i'll write this song if that's what it take chorus x2 make me go away make me go away
