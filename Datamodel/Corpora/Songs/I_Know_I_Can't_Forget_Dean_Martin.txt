there were other loves before i found you and i wish sometimes that we had never met for life without you darling can never be the same for having loved you once i can't forget forget i remember all your smiles and laughter and laughter i remember love light shining in your eyes and though i only had you for just a little while when you were there the whole world seemed so right all i remember these things through bitter tears all the touch of your hand in mine all and though you're not here through the lonely years with memories of you i'll never be the alone there'll maybe other arms to soothe my sadness there will be other loves that i have never met but life without you darling can never be the same for having loved you once i can't forget you for life without you darling can never be the same for having loved you once for having loved you once i can't i can't forget i know i can't i can't forget
