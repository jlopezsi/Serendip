i had a job i had a girl i had something going mister in this world i got laid off down at the lumber yard our love went bad times got hard now i work down at the car wash where all it ever does is rain don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train she just said joe i gotta go we had it once we ain't got it anymore she packed her bags left me behind she bought a ticket on the central line nights as i sleep i hear that whistle whining i feel her kiss in the misty rain and i feel like i'm a rider on a downbound train last night i heard your voice you were crying crying you were so alone you said your love had never died you were waiting for me at home put on my jacket i ran through the woods i ran till i thought my chest would explode there in the clearing beyond the highway in the moonlight our wedding house shone i rushed through the yard i burst through the front door my head pounding hard up the stairs i climbed the room was dark our bed was empty then i heard that long whistle whine and i dropped to my knees hung my head and cried now i swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang knocking down them cross ties working in the rain now don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train
