you've heard every line before my life's a revolving door with no way out and no way in you know just what's on my mind could you take a chance one more time maybe we could start all over again straight from the heart straight from the heart straight from the heart straight from the heart your eyes can't tell a lie i can see what you're feeling inside don't give up before we start cause this time love is straight from the heart straight from the heart i know what they're telling you i wish i could say that it's not true love is so hard to find but i never took the time i never let you in please let me try again straight from the heart i thought i knew about love but i didn't know at all didn't take the time to see until i started to fall straight from the heart straight from the heart
