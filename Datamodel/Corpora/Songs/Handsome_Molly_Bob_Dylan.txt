well i wish i was in london or some other seaport town i'd put my foot on a steamboat i'd sail the ocean round while sailing round the ocean while sailing round the sea i'd think of handsome molly wherever she might be don't you remember molly you gave me your right hand you said whenever you'd marry i would be the man but you broke your promise go with whom you please my poor heart is aching you are at your ease i went to church last sunday molly came ridin by i could tell her mind was changin by the rovin of her eye i go down to the river though everyone's asleep i think of handsome molly an i begin to weep so i wish i was in london or some other seaport town i'd put my foot on a steamboat i'd sail the ocean round
