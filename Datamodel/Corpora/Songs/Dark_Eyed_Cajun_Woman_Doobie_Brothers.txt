i think back to the time when i first saw your face you were walkin across the delta to your cold and lonely place you know i took you for a small girl really not quite seventeen oh lord but i was wrong oh so wrong you're like a woman i've never seen dark eyed cajun woman where are you comin from your soul is in the back woods they say you never had a home but i'm gonna know you better if it takes all night and day dark eyed cajun woman you'll never get away no no now the evenin breeze is blowin i hear your voice most everywhere your cold black eyes they are dancin in the starlight warmin the cold night air it's so beautiful you know i have to say dark eyed cajun woman you'll never get away
