i don't have a balance think i'm gonna fall wish i have a talent i don't belong here at all drowning in the pressure in above my head why did i think i could do this i should have walk away instead refrain this is my chance to break free everythings depending on me and if i keep trying i'll be chorus on top of the world where i can see everything before me reaching up to touch the sky on top of the world where all of my dreams are rushed into me stretching on my wings to fly on top of the world on top of the world repeat refrain chorus on top of the world where i can see everything before me reaching up to touch the sky on top of the world where all of my dreams are rushed into me stretching on my wings to fly on top of the world
