i've been bruised and i've been broken can't believe that i put up with all this pain i've been used and i was choking on the promise i would never fall again i used to sing to your twisted symphony the words that had me trapped inside your misery but now i know the reason why i couldn't breathe chorus cause all i want is everything you're not so go ahead and slam the door cause you can't shut me out and no i don't i don't care what you say cause all i really all i really want is everything you're not everything you're not not not your darkness was my weakness but it turns out that it only went so deep a meaningless diversion that is all that you ever meant to me and i am done with your twisted symphony the words that had me sound like stolen poetry i tore the pages and i can finally breathe chorus i want a gentleman who treats me like a queen i need respect i need love nothing in between i will not spell it out for you if you can't see cause you're not worthy you don't deserve me a now i'm gone everything you're not not not everything you're not not not chorus never gonna break my heart again never gonna see your face again never wanna feel this way again
