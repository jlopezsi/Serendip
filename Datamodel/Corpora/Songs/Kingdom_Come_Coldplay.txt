one two steal my heart and hold my tongue i feel my time my time has come let me in unlock the door i've never felt this way before and the wheels just keep on turning the drummer begins to drum i don't know which way i'm going i don't know which way i've come hold my head inside your hands i need someone who understands i need someone someone who hears for you i've waited all these years for you i'd wait til kingdom come until my day my day is done and say you'll come and set me free just say you'll wait you'll wait for me in your tears and in your blood in your fire and in your flood i hear you laugh i heard you sing i wouldn't change a single thing the wheels just keep on turning the drummers begin to drum i don't know which way i'm going i don't know what i'll become for you i'd wait til kingdom come until my days my days are done and say you'll come and set me free just say you'll wait you'll wait for me just say you'll wait you'll wait for me just say you'll wait you'll wait for me
