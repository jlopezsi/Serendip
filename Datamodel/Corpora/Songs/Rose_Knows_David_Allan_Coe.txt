i told you from the start i couldn't give you my heart it belonged to someone else i tried like hell but still we fell i guess we could not help ourselves you sure felt good in my world little girl but it's time to draw the line cause there's a lady who's mine and she's not the kind to just die upon the vine rose knows something's going on rose knows she's spending too much time alone i suppose better get myself back home rose knows something's going on i'd love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time i wish it could be but unfortunately i've got roses on my mind rose knows something's going on rose knows something's going on
