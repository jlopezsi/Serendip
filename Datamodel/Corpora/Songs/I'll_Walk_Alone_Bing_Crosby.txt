i'll walk alone but to tell you the truth i'll be lonely i don't mind being lonely when my heart tells me you are lonely too i'll walk alone they'll ask me why and i'll tell them i'd rather there are dreams i must gather dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight i'll always be near you wherever you are each night in every prayer if you call i'll hear you no matter how far just close your eyes and i'll be there please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me till you're walking beside me i'll walk alone i'll always be near you wherever you are each night in every prayer if you call i'll hear you no matter how far just close your eyes and i'll be there please walk alone and send your love and your kisses to guide me till you're walking beside me i'll walk alone i'll walk alone
