i see reflections in the water autumn colours summer's daughter and as as the year is growing older i see winter on my shoulder i stand in the haze watching stormy ripples grow on my own never knew your needed till i found myself standing here alone and in the water such a sad face slowly drowning such a sad face if only i could change the seasons like a poet i've my reasons it started to snow in the middle of july wonder why never did understand you my sorrow is hanging in the grey sky in the summer days we flew to the sun on melting wings but the seasons changed to fast leave us all behind blind but then the stone fell on the water putting end to summer's daughter and me i turn away remembering all the seasons such a sad thing it started to rain in the middle of the sun winter's begun never did understand you my sorrow is hanging in the grey sky in the summer days we flew to the sun on melting wings but the seasons changed to fast leave us all behind blind
