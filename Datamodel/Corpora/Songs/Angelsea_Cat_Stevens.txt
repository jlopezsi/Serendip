she moves like and angel and seven evening stars dance through the window of her universal house he voice a crystal echo lies humming in your soul so patiently awaiting for your ears to behold she ripples on the water leaves diamonds on the shore and fish from every distance watch her ocean cellar door her breath a warm fire in every lovers heart a mistress to magicians and a dancer to the gods and a dancer to the gods her clothes are made of rainbows and twenty thousand tears shine through the spaces of her golden ochre hair ooh my babe i want you and on my life i swear my conscience will i follow you forever if you meet me everywhere yes if you if you meet me everywhere
