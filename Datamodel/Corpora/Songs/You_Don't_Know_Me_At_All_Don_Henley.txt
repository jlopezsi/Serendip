i woke up this morning with an attitude looked at the headlines put me in a real bad mood sitting here remember tryin to stay sane between the end of the summer and the comin of the blessed rains and i feel dirty all the way down i feel dirty baby like this dirty town i gave you everything on a silver tray could have been a fool forever but i'm not made that way and after all these years i think it's time to say goodbye i'm doing you a favor i will not help you live a lie and believe me if you think i'm gonna catch you when you fall you don't know me you don't know me at all i closed up the curtains learned to confess baby i knew better but you were such a pretty mess you took my breath away and now i want it back aah you should have killed me cause you always looked so good in black and after all these twisted roads that we've been down together i think it's time to say goodbye and believe me if you think i'm gonna get down and crawl you don't know me you don't know me at all oooooo after all these years i think it's time to say goodbye i'm doing us a favor baby you know i cannot live a lie and when you need me and you think i'm gonna be there when you call you don't know me you don't know me at all you don't know me at all la de da you don't know me at all you don't know me at all
