i am happy that i have you even though you're not here now i know somewhere you are dreaming though it's definitely not of me it doesn't matter if this all shatters nothing lasts forever but i'm praying that we're staying together i am warmed by your friendship even when you're far away and i'm happy in the knowledge we may never see the day when i kiss you and you kiss me don't pretend you miss me the worst kind of diseased mind is one filled with jealousy if we should meet again don't try to solve the puzzle just lay down next to me and please don't move a muscle i will thank you most of all for the respect you have for me i'm embarrassed it overwhelms me because i don't deserve any it doesn't matter if this all shatters nothing lasts forever but i'm praying that we're staying together
