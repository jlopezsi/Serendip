i'm hearing images i'm seeing songs no poet has ever painted voices call out to me straight to my heart so strange yet we're so well acquainted i let the music speak with no restrains i let my feelings take over carry my soul away into the world where beauty meets the darkness of the day where my mind is like an open window where the high and healing winds blow from my shallow sleep the sounds awake me i let them take me let it be a joke let it be a smile let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while let it be a tear let it be a sigh coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry some streets are emptiness dry leaves of autumn rustling down an old alley and in the dead of night i find myself a blind man in some ancient valley i let the music speak leading me gently urging me like a lover leading me all the way into a place where beauty will defeat the darkest day where i'm one with every grand illusion no disturbance no intrusion where i let the wistful sounds seduce me i let them use me let it be a joke let it be a smile let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while let it be a tear let it be a sigh coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry let it be a tear let it be a sigh coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry let it be the joy of each new sunrise or the moment when a day dies i surrender without reservation no explanation no questions why i take it to me and let it flow through me yes i let the music speak i let the music speak
