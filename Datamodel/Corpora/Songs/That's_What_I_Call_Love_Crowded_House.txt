you take away my air you make my lungs collapse i die tonight feeling devastated that's what i call livin in your memory that's what i call tired and deflated that's what i call love i tidy up your room you tidy up my life show me the door i'm abandoned here i'm warm to the core i can feel you sink i swim we never got in that deep you bend i break i die tonight feeling devastated that's what i call hangin on and fallin over that's what i call tired and deflated that's what i call love i got a little room the air's still pretty bad i die tonight feeling devastated that's what i call hangin on and fallin over that's what i call tired and deflated that's what i call feeling devastated that's livin with a vacuum cleaner what sweepin up your memory i call love
