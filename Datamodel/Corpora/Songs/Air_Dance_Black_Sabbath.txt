she sits in silence in her midnight world her faded pictures of her dancing girls her distant dreamer on the seas of time her happy memories dancing through her mind in days of romance she was the queen of dance she'd dance the night away and as the seasons turn the days to years she holds her pictures hears the silent cheers the days grow lonely for the dancing queen and now she dances only in her dreams in days of romance she was the queen of dance she'd dance the night away away away away
