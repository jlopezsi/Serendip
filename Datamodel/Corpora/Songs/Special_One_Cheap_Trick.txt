two thousand years gone by and going strong well never fear my love it won't be long you say you've had enough it seems so wrong now it's suicide oh my love and now you know just why i'm here and now my eyes they see so clear no fear where do we go from here it's in your head so many tears we'll cry before we're dead remember me my love and what we said i will stand by you all night long and now you know just why i'm here and now my eyes can see so clear oh baby just like the dreams you grow old and die no one pretends to know just why i feel the calm before the storm i'm here kiss me again before you go there's something else that you should know my life will be hell without you my belle oh give all my love my love
