somewhere overhead distant thunder roars the revolution has begun the war to end all wars as i welcome death i hear the battle cry bullets fall like fire raining from the sky the rebel in us all someday gets tired of being pushed around but freedom has a price the cost is buried in the ground we suffered far too long we gather now growing stronger we will not be ignored anymore any longer our anthem will guide us rise up be counted stand strong and unite wait for the outcry resistance is calling tonight far too many years of chaos and unrest far too many voices brutally suppressed we fight for what is just for all that we believe we fight till death or glory fight to be set free the streets are bathed in blood time to step down and time to walk away you'll never rule me now though you may stand upon my grave you can look the other way or you can face the light although it seems so far away freedom's worth the fight rise up be counted stand strong and unite wait for the outcry resistance is calling rise up be counted stand strong and unite wait for the outcry resistance is calling tonight the world watches on while we risk our lives locked in a kingdom of fear as our children die
