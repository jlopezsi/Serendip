if i never met you if i never saw your face this world this world would be a colder place i bet if we'd never met if i never met you if i never knew your love my life my life might be a sad song of regret if we'd never met but we said one hello and look at how the world begins to spin look at how the shadows disappear now that you are here if i never met you if i never felt your kiss my days my nights would not be filled like this it's true i don't know who i'd love i don't know what i'd do if i never met you just look at how the shadows disappear now that you are here if i never met you if i never felt your kiss my days my nights would be filled like this it's true i don't know who i'd love i don't know what i'd do if i never met you i don't know who i'd love i don't know what i'd do if i never met you we must be loving right some folks got nothin but troubles so little joy in their lives but wherever we go happiness follows we must be lovin right it might be the way i adore you or the way that you hold me tight i don't know the reason but i'm believin we must be lovin right all of our friends say love fades away with time but i know they're wrong cause they've never known a love like yours and mine so if the whole world goes crazy let everyone else fuss and fight when all's said and done we'll be the lucky ones we must be lovin right some folks got nothin but troubles oh so little joy in their lives but wherever we go happiness follows we must be lovin right we must be lovin right
