the book of love that sacred place where we walk tall or in disgrace who tills the ground on which we tread who gives us all our daily bread the spirit woken from its sleep the demon stirring from the deep whose gates at dawn we all must pass the last one first the first one last whose words must be both black and white whose music shall be day and night the moon that tells us of the sun where voices soar so far above these pages are the book of love if we were born just to succeed if life was meant to be a choice for either happiness or greed if you can't walk you'll always run away from anyone yes you will but if we learn to take our time as though each moment is a treasure that's not so hard to find when you are free then suddenly there's room for everyone yes there is chorus the book of love the world of dreams those shadows fall upon us all and send our weary eyes to sleep but when you wake your heart will make some room for everyone just come to me there's nothing you should fear just come to me i'll always be right here i tell you now your heart is where i live and what you ask is what i'll give if we were born just to succeed if life was meant to be a choice for either happiness or greed if you can't walk you always run away from anyone yes you will but if we learn to take our time as though each moment is a treasure that's not so hard to find when you are free then suddenly there's room for everyone yes there is repeat chorus
