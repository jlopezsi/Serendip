picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor reaching for the phone cause i can't fight it anymore and i wonder if i ever cross your mind for me it happens all the time it's a quarter after one i'm all alone and i need you now said i wouldn't call but i lost all control and i need you now and i don't know how i can do without i just need you now another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before and i wonder if i ever cross your mind for me it happens all the time it's a quarter after one i'm a little drunk and i need you now said i wouldn't call but i lost all control and i need you now and i don't know how i can do without i just need you now yes i'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all it's a quarter after one i'm all alone and i need you now and i said i wouldn't call but i'm a little drunk and i need you now and i don't know how i can do without i just need you now i just need you now oh baby i need you now
