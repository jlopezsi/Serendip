words and music by bob seger think in terms of bridges burned think of seasons that must end see the rivers rise and fall they will rise and fall again everything must have an end like an ocean to a shore like a river to a stream like a river to a stream it's the famous final scene and how you tried to make it work did you really think it could how you tried to make it last did you really think it would like a guest who stayed too long now it's finally time to leave yes it's finally time to leave take it calmly and serene it's the famous final scene it's been coming on so long you were just the last to know it's been a long time since you've smiled seems like oh so long ago now the stage has all been set and the nights are growing cold soon the winter will be here and there's no one warm to hold now the lines have all been read and you knew them all by heart now you move toward the door here it comes the hardest part try the handle of the road feeling different feeling strange this can never be arranged as the light fades from the screen from the famous final scene
