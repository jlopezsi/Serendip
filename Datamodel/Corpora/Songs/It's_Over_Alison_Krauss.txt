the nights are so lonely and the days pass me by true love has faded left me behind so we'll just move along and stop wasting time it's over all over now it's over end of the line it's over and your doin fine it's over and over and over i'm asking why you're leaving it's over now gone are the love songs that only we knew robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through gone is the sweet love tried but untrue it's over all over now it's over end of the line it's over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way hoping you'll stay cause it's over all over now it's over all over now
