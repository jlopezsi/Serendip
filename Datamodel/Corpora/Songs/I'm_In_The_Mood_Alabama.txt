i knock off with a lot on my mind from a long hard day pull in at home see you and find my stress slipping away then you run to my arms and give me a kiss and nothing else matters when you hold me like this chorus girl i'm in the mood to be your man to win your heart all over again let my eyes trace let my lips taste nothing but you i'm in the mood to close the door make love tonight like never before rush after rush like waves on the shore girl i'm in the mood all day long i'm so strong then i hear you speak i'm drawn to your fire your signs of desire girl you make me weak i go drifting away like a leaf in the wind i'm under a spell your touch put me in girl i'm in the mood to be your man to win your heart all over again let my eyes trace let my lips taste nothing but you yeah i'm in the mood to close the door make love tonight like never before rush after rush like waves on the shore girl i'm in the mood
