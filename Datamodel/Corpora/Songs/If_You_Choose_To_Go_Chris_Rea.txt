there's a street outside my window there's a light outside my door there's a road straight through this old town there's a boat on every shore there's a promise down that freeway but there is no guarantee there are dreams on every ocean there are storms on every sea if you choose to go now i've been out upon that ocean sometimes further that before sometimes not even past my waistline and i screamed at what i saw many times along that freeway returning sometimes beat there are dreams on every ocean there are storms on every sea if you choose to go plenty of places plenty of things to see plenty of faces plenty of ways to be if you choose to go
