start the car lets make a midnight run across the river to south london to dance to the latest hi-fi sound of bass guitar and drum seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure off stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat take a piece of cloth a coin for thirst for the sweat will start to run with a cymbal splash a word of truth and a rocking bass and drum seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure on stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat so one by one they come on down from the tower blocks of my home town stepping with the rhythm of the rockers beat drowning out the pressure of the crooked beat seeking out a rhythm that can take the tension on stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat it has crooked past this crooked street where cars patrol this crooked beat badges flash and sirens wail they'll be taking one and all to jail prance prance you want a law to dance
