and the hardest part was letting go not taking part was the hardest part and the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring it was the strangest start i could feel it go down bittersweet i could taste in my mouth silver lining the cloud oh and i i wish that i could work it out and the hardest part was letting go not taking part you really broke my heart and i tried to sing but i couldn't think of anything and that was the hardest part i could feel it go down you left the sweetest taste in my mouth you're silver lining the clouds oh and i oh and i i wonder what it's all about i wonder what it's all about everything i know is wrong everything i do it's just comes undone and everything is torn apart oh and it's the part that's the hardest part yeah that's the hardest part that's the hardest part
