sitting in an s.d.t waiting for an underground train to rumble underneath my feet bang goes another day where it went i could not say now i'll have to wait another week when all is said and all is done what was said was never done don't panic it's not really worth your while bang goes another year in and out of one ear everybody's doing it so do it too chorus i don't need anyone but a little love would make things better but a little love would make things better sitting on the early bus passing through the morning rush it makes no difference that i'm not with you bang goes another year in and out of one ear everybody's doing it so do it too chorus i don't need anyone but a little love would make things better i don't need anyone but a little of your love can make things better
