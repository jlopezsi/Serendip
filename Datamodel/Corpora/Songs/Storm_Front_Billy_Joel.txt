safe at harbor everything is easy off to starboard daylight comes up fast now i'm restless for the open water red flags are flying fromhe coast guard mast they told me to stay i heard all the information i motored away and steered straight ahead though the weatherman said chorus there's a storm front coming mood indigo white water running and the pressure is low storm front coming mood indigo small craft warning on the radio i've been sailing a long time on this ocean man gets lonesome all those years at sea i've got a woman my life should be easy most men hunger for the life i lead the morning was gray but i had the motivation i drifted away and ran into more heavy weather off shore chorus we've got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze we've got a falling barometer and rising seas we've got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale we've got a force nine blowing on the beaufort scale i'm still restless for the open water though she gives me everything i need she asked me to stay but i'd done my navigation i drove her away but i should have known to stay tied up at home chorus
