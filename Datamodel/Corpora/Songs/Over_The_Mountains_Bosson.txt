i've made up my mind i've packed my bags i'm not returning home until someone will give me reason to i lock the door and take a breath i'm ready to let go i know you're somewhere out there too there's only one thing for me to do and i go chorus over the mountains and over the sea to find a heart that belongs to me anywhere in the world i go anywhere til i find you i run through the valleys i run through the fields i'd do anything i am hard to please and anywhere in the world i go anywhere til i find you i fly like the wind i don't know where my heart will lead the way i need someone to love and hold on to but the road is long i've had my doubts but nothing lets me down cause i know you're somewhere out there too waiting for me to get to you and i go chorus it doesn't matter what the time will tell cause i will be here waiting for you for you and me it doesn't matter what the others say cause i will keep on searching and i go and i go and i go and i go chorus x2
