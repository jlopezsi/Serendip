if you can see me i can see you i could wear your new blue shoes i should wear your old red dress and walk to the crossroads so take this knife and meet me across the river just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss american from nowhere to nothing and i go way back children swarm like thousands of bugs towards the lights the beacons above the hill the stars to the west the south the north and to the east now you could say i've got a gift of sorts a fear of rear windows and swinging doors a love of violence and dread of sighs if you can see me i can see you if you can see me i can see you i have seen these bairns wave their fists at god swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground in their excitement for tomorrow i could wear your new blue shoes i should wear your old red dress and walk to the crossroads so take this knife and meet me across the river i will take your lands and all that lays beneath the dust of cold flowers prison of dark of ashes i will slaughter your kind who descend from belief i am the spirit of greed a lord of theft i'll burn all your books and the problems they make if you can see me i can see you if you can see me
