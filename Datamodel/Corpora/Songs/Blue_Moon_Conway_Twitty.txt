once upon a time before i took up smiling i hated the moonlight shadows of the night like the poorest find beguiling seems flat as the moonlight with no one to stay up for i went to sleep at ten and life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men blue moon you saw me standing alone without a dream in my heart without a love of my own blue moon you knew just what i was there for you heard me saying a prayer for someone i really could care for and then there suddenly appeared before me the only one my arms will ever hold i heard somebody whisper please adore me and when i looked the moon had turned to gold blue moon now i'm no longer alone without a dream in my heart without a love of my own blue moon
