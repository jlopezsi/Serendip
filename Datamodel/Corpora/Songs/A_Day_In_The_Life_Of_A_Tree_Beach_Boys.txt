feel the wind burn through my skin the pain the air is killing me for years my limbs stretched to the sky a nest for birds to sit and sing but now my branches suffer and my leaves don't bear the glow they did so long ago one day i was full of life my sap was rich and i was strong from seed to tree i grew so tall through wind and rain i could not fall but now my branches suffer and my leaves don't offer poetry to men of song trees like me weren't meant to live if all this world can give pollution and slow death oh lord i lay me down no life's left to be found there's nothing left for me trees like me weren't meant to live if all this earth can give is pollution trees like me weren't meant to live oh lord i lay me down if all this earth can give my branches to the ground is pollution and slow death there's nothing left for me oh lord i lay me down my branches to the ground there's nothing left for me
