a perfect day the sun is sinkin low as evening falls the gentle breezes blow the time we shared went by so fast just like a dream we knew it couldn't last but i'd do it all again if i could somehow but i must be leavin soon it's your world now it's your world now my race is run i'm moving on like the setting sun no sad goodbyes no tears allowed you'll be alright it's your world now even when we are apart you'll always be in my heart when dark clouds appear in the sky remember true love never dies but first a kiss one glass of wine just one more dance while there's still time my one last wish someday you'll see how hard i tried and how much you meant to me it's your world now use well the time be part of something good leave something good behind the curtain falls i take my bow that's how it's meant to be it's your world now it's your world now it's your world now
