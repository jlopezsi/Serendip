god's given us years of happiness here now we must part and as the angels come and call for you the pains of grief tug at my heart oh my darling my darling my heart breaks as you take your long journey oh the days will be empty the nights so long without you my love and when god calls for you i'm left alone but we will meet in heaven above oh my darling my darling my heart breaks as you take your long journey fond memories i'll keep of happy ways that on earth we trod and when i come we will walk hand in hand as one in heaven in the family of god oh my darling my darling my heart breaks as you take your long journey
