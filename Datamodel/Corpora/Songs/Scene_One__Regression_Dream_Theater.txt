h close your eyes and begin to relax take a deep breath and let it out slowly concentrate on your breathing with each breath you become more relaxed imagine a brilliant white light above you focusing on this light as it flows through your body allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind now as i count backward from ten to one you will fill more peaceful and calm ten nine eight seven six you will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you five four three two if at any time you need to came back all you must do is open your eyes one n safe in the light that surrounds me free of the fear and the pain my subconscious mind starts spinning through time to rejoin the past once again nothing seems real i'm starting to feel lost in the haze of a dream and as i draw near the scene becomes clear like watching my life on a screen hello victoria so glad to see you my friend h hypnotist n nicholas
