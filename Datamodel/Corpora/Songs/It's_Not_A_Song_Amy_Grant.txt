day turns to night and i turn into bed can't get to sleep something's in my head pacing the floor i try to force a rhyme why do i fear this time chorus it's not a song till it touches your heart it's not a song till it tears you apart after what's left of what's right and what's wrong till it gets through to you it's not a song now close your eyes look into your hand what do you see life is our song to give and learn to take time will not wait oh won't you please come dance while the song's still playing won't be long till the silence falls chorus x4
