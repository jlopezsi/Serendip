sometimes the road is crystal and sometimes i feel like i'm losing my mind tell me what it is what you think you're missing and i will see what i can find you want to be so sure of every step you take you cant always know what's coming you cant always trust the twist of fate oh my love my heart is set on you set on you oh my love my heart is set on you set on you stars shine down from the black and we're picking though this broken glass well how could we know that our lives would be so full of beautifully broken things oh my love my heart is set on you set on you oh my love my heart is set on you set on you war is the most vulgar madness and winters can be so cruel you can't always change the way things are like i can't change the way i think of you oh my love my heart is set on you set on you oh my love my heart is set on you set on you oh my love my love my love oh my love my heart is set on you set on you
