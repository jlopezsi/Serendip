a lovely poignant song about a man fated to be kept apart from his true love well sometimes i dream of gettin outta here headin down towards them old tracks i swore i'd come and get her but i know i ain't never goin back there's nights i can't sleep no matter how hard i try so from my window i watch the moonlight fall on the far hillside i imagine i put on my jacket go down to this little roadside bar pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor to a mexican guitar
