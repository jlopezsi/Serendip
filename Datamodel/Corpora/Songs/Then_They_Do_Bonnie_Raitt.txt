in the early rush of morning trying to get the kids to school one's hanging on my shirttail another's locked up in her room and i'm yelling up the stairs stop worrying bout your hair you look fine then they're fightin in the backseat i'm playing referee now someone's gotta go the moment that we leave and everybody's late i swear that i can't wait till they grow up chorus then they do and that's how it is it's just quiet in the morning can't believe how much you miss all they do and all they did you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true then they do now the youngest is starting college she'll be leavin in the fall and brianna's latest boyfriend called to ask if we could talk and i got the impression that he's about to pop the question any day i look over at their pictures sittin in their frames i see them as babies i guess that'll never change you pray all their lives that someday they will find happiness chorus then they do and that's how it is it's just quiet in the morning can't believe how much you miss all they do and all they did you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true then they do no more monday pta's no carpools or soccer games your work is done now you've got time that's all your own you've been waitin for so long for those days to come chorus then they do and that's how it is it's just quiet in the morning can't believe how much you miss all they do and all they did you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true then they do
