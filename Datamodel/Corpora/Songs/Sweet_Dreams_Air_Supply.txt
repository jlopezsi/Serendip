this is the time when you need a friend you just need someone near i'm not looking forward to the night i'll spend thinking of you when you're not here how many times will i think about the things i'd like to do always denied the right to live my life the way i want i want to share it with you close your eyes i want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams close your eyes i want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams i'll think of your kiss as the days roll by and i'll write the words you love what i can't say in a letter will just have to wait till i get home there's not much time to tell you half the things i should only that i'm so glad i fell in love with you and i'd do it again if i could close your eyes i want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams close your eyes i want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams sleep like a child resting deep you don't know what you give me i keep for these moments alone
