i used to visit the very gay places those come what may places where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life to get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails all the men i knew had sad and sullen gray faces with distingue traces that used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away by too many through the day twelve o'clock tales then you came along with your siren song to tempt me to madness i knew all the while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me oh yes i was wrong again i was wrong now life is lonely again and only last year everything seemed so sure now life is awful again a troughful of hearts would only be a bore a week in paris will ease the bite of it but all i really care is to smile in spite of it i'll forget you i will and yet you are still burning inside my brain romance is mush stifling those who strive i'll live a lush life in some small dive and there i'll be while i rot with the rest of those whose lives are lonely too
