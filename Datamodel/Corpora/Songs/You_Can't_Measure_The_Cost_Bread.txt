the silken skies that so remind and mesmerize and finally blind me the downy softness of herself forever lingering behind me never ever has there been nor will ever be again one someone to give you love tenderness and be your friend hanging on till the bitter end you can't measure the cost of a woman lost but it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need i've tried to look inside myself to find the strength from which to draw from the view she saw from since she tried to go too deep limitations brought her down and though i'd like to free her mind visitations bring a frown i gotta find the place she found you can't measure the cost of a woman lost but it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there where she is no one seems to know the silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems the morning mist that melts upon the meadow brings a touch of sorrow the one i kissed is all alone and may or may not know tomorrow just an ordinary girl to the ordinary eye but so much deeper goes the vein like the glittering of gold you want to touch then you gotta hold you can't measure the cost of a woman lost
