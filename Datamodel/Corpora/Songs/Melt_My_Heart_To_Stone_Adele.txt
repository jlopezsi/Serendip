right under my feet there's air made of bricks pulls me down turns me weak for you i find myself repeating like a broken tune and i'm forever excusing your intentions that i give in to my pretendings which forgive you each time without me knowing they melt my heart to stone chorus and i hear your words that i made up you say my name like there could be an us i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love i'm the only one in love each and every time i turn around to leave i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed so desperately i try to link it with my head but instead i fall back to my knees as you tear your way right through me i forgive you once again without me knowing you've burnt my heart to stone and i hear your words that i made up you say my name like there could be an us i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love i'm the only one in love why do you steal my hand whenever i'm standing my own ground you build me up then leave me dead i hear your words you made up i say your name like there should be an us i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love i'm the only one in love
