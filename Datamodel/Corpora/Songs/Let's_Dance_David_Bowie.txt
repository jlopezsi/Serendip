let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues let's dance dance to the song they're playing on the radio let's sway while color lights up your face let's sway sway through the crowd to an empty space if you say run i'll run with you if you say hide we'll hide watch my love for you it would break my heart in two if you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower let's dance for fear your grace should fall let's dance for fear tonight is all let's sway you can look into my eyes let's sway underthe moonlight the sirius moonlight if you say run i'll run with you if you say hide we'll hide watch my love for you it would break my heart in two if you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower let's dance let's dance let's dance let's dance let's dance let's dance
