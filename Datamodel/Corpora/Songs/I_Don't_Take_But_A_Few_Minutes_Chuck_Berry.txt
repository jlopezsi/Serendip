when i see those big brown eyes is when i take my queue it don't take me but a few minutes to get a message through i talked to you and you talked to me and we talked to one another it don't take us but a few minutes to understand each other if i was twenty-three years old and you were twenty-two i bet no one would try to run our lives the way they do we take a chance and try romance be true to one another it don't take us but a few minutes when we want each other if i was in san diego and you were in portland maine i'd fly to you lock stock and bone in hail and pouring rain over the mountains through the valleys coming home to each other it don't take us but a few minutes to get to one another you would write a love song and play on my guitar and if you should in hollywood become a movie star would you let your heart forget i loved you and you only it don't take but a few minutes when you're feeling lonely
