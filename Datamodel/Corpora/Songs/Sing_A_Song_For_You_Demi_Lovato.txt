didn't know what to get you ordinary just wouldn't do but i just found the perfect gift for you i hear church bells a ringing careless singing harmony with me now you are looking so lovely oohh even if the lights go out we've got mistletoe and fire light on this cold december night the snow outside will said the moon as i sing my song we've got mistletoe and fire light on this cold december night the snow outside will said the moon as i sing my song for you sing my song sing my song for you
