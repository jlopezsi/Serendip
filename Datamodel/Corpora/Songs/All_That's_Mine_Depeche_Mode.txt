i know it's hard to reach you i know it's hard to breathe i know it's hard to be you sometimes i can't imagine what that means this must be someone else's story i can't follow what you've planned how could this be about me am i supposed to understand like a ship on the ocean heading out to sea you can hardly see it now it's a lot like you lost like me you're still looking for redemption still can't find a trace if there is nothing after there ll be the saving grace i'm giving you control now i need some kind of sign can't take away the sorrow now i gave you all that's mine like a ship on the ocean heading out to sea you can hardly see it now it's a lot like you like a ship on the ocean heading out to sea you can hardly see it now it's a lot like you lost like me
