whoa oh welcome to the greatest show greatest show on earth you've never seen before here the fairytale unfolds what's behind the smoke and glass painted faces everybody wears a mask are you selling them your soul well you'll be left out in the cold is it all blue skies fun and games until you fall then you're left without anyone at all you're riding on a shooting star with a smile upon your face but soon the shine fades and you're left out all alone wondering where did they all go oh been jaded hated who'll be around when the limelight's faded been shut down pushed out made to smile when i wanted to frown always taking a bow always working the crowd always making new grounds always playing the clown who'll be sticking it out who'll be staying around when the lights go down
