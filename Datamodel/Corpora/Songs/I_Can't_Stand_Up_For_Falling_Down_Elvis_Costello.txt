i'm the living result i'm a man who's been hurt a little too much and i've tasted the bitterness of my own tears sadness is all my lonely heart can feel i can't stand up for falling down i can't stand up for falling down simple though love is still it confused me why i'm not loved the way i should be now i've lived with heartaches and i've roomed with fear i've dealt with despair and i've wrestled with tears i can't stand up for falling down i can't stand up for falling down the vow that we made you broke it in two but that don't stop me from loving you i can't stand up for falling down i can't stand up for falling down
