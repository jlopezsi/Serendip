i've been staring at the floor and i've been holding back the tears and i'd been talking to the walls if the walls had ears and now it seems that every time i look into your eyes there is only so far i can see chorus so take me back there where only we can go when you touch me the memories unfold and i remember love i remember love do you remember love i've been looking to the future and i've been dreaming of our past but now i'm counting on this moment cause it may be the last and days go by and still i try to reach into your soul there is only so far i can go chorus remember the times when our world was alive and all of the answers were clear remember the times when our souls would ignite and passion explodes into fears and i remember love i remember love do you remember love
