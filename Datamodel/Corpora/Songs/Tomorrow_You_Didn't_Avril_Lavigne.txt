it's a forgone conclusion you're love's an illusion and the picture is starting to fade boy let's be honest when it comes to your promise it's just a lot of empty words you say and the future's only gonna be more of the same you've only got yourself to blame chorus tomorrow you didn't yesterday you won't cause i know everything you say you gonna do you don't that's a given it doesn't matter anyway hey i know what love wasn't i know what love isn't so when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding tomorrow you didn't hey hey i'm outta here today i used to believe in all your romantic dreaming but it really ain't that cute anymore cause my time's to precious so i wish you the best with whatever it is you're looking for baby this is all for your own good i'm leaving cause i know you never would chorus i don't need a crystalball to see it all my dear it doesn't matter what you say it always turns out the same way your predictions are fiction and it's tragically clear guitar solo chorus dadada yea
