baby i see this world has made you sad some people can be bad the things they do the things they say but baby i'll wipe away those bitter tears i'll chase away those restless fears that turn your blue skies into gray why worry there should be laughter after pain there should be sunshine after rain these things have always been the same so why worry now why worry now baby when i get down i turn to you and you make sense of what i do and all the isn't hard is the same but baby just when this world seems mean and cold our love comes shinning red and gold and all the rest is by the way why worry there should be laughter after pain there should be sunshine after rain these things have always been the same so why worry now why worry now
