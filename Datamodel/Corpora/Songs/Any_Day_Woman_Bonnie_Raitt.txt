if you don't love her you'd better let her go you'll never fool her you're bound to let it show love's so hard to take when you have to fake everything in return you just preserve her when you serve her a little tenderness if she's a woman she'll try to make it last if you're a man now you'd better end it fast there's no reason here no treason here just the way a woman's mind well she has no name she has no shame she just loves you it's not easy to undo what's done or to speak too freely to just anyone and if this takes more than you bargained for boy it's time you learn not to talk so loud walk so proud when you're comin on
