i don't like those other guys looking at your curves i don't like you walking round with physical jerks everything they say and do is getting on my nerves soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks cause when they pull the shutters down and throw up in the dark they'll find that all the dogs outside bite much worse than they bark chorus here we are living in paradise living in luxury oh the thrill is here but it won't last long you better have your fun before it moves along and you're already looking for another fool like me i call you betty felon cause you are a pretty villain and i think that i should tell them that you'd make a pretty killing cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate saying we always knew you'd make it didn't think you'd come this late and now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun when everyone in paradise carries a gun chorus later in the evening when arrangements are made i'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door cause i'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid that never go further than floor to floor you think that i don't know the boy that you're touching but i'll be at the video and i will be watching chorus
