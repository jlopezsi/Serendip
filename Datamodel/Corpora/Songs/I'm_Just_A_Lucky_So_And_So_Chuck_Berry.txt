as i walked down the street seems everyone i meet gives me a friendly hello guess i'm just a lucky so and so birds in every tree seem all so near to me they sing wherever i go guess i'm just a lucky so and so chorus if you should ask me the amount in my bank account i would have to confess that i'm slipping but that don't worry me confidentially i got a dream that i'm tip in and when the days through each night i hurry to home where love ways i know guess i'm just a lucky so and so chorus and when the days through each night i hurry to home where love ways i know guess i'm just a lucky so and so woo just a lucky so and so
