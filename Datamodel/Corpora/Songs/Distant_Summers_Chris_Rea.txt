sweet serenade in your shade may i rest just for a while won't stay long i'll do my best to help you help me to find some friends that i have lost who lie in lands where memories and dreams are lost the breeze that blew around her hair that day the timeless dress that flowed in endless sway i almost touched her shoulder she almost turned to face me a thousand distant summers away
