oh how i wish that they would last moments of peace that just slip through me so fast just when i think that they are gonna stay everything inside me just starts fading away sometimes it seems like all i hope for just gets thrown down on the floor and then it seems like you don't love me anymore sometimes i wish that i could run away sometimes i wish i just had something to say he looks at me and doesn't know the words to say but it's not you i just don't feel quite right today all these things i say and do were never planned but how the fuck am i supposed to make you understand that sometimes it seems like all i hope for just gets thrown down on the floor and then it seems like you don't love me anymore sometimes i wish that i could run away sometimes i wish i just had something to say
