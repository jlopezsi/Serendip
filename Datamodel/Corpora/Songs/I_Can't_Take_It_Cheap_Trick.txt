well i saw you today and realized how i missed my peace of mind i feel your breath in my ear but late at night it's you i always think about that little girl inside of you i once knew i should have known better still the smell of you was on my face but you were too busy to notice me last night chorus now i can't take it alone i can't make it alone i can't take it i can't make it alone oh no ooh oh no then i tell myself i'll put you down don't want to see your face around don't call me up anymore when i hear your voice it's in my ear you're kissing on the phone it makes it all come clear chorus i try to tell myself don't need you anymore don't want you hanging around my door oh no now i can't take it alone i can't make it alone i can't take it alone i can't make it alone i can't take it alone i can't make it alone if it's wrong or right i can't take it i can't make it alone you know how i tried i can't take it i can't make it alone i try tell myself don't need you anymore i can't take it alone i can't make it alone oh baby my pretty baby i can't take it alone i can't make it alone
