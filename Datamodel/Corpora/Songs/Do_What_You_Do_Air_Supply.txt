do what you do cause you do it so well so stand in my way if only i knew what these eyes could not tell what this mouth could not say people are wrong but i'm right this time i'm losing bad friends fast do what you do and keep it that way and this love will last do what you do when your lights are turned down and you wake up afraid think of the love that i have here for you and the wish will be made only a cut of the deepest kind could break what i hold for you i know the cut will never be mine so do what you do waiting to put a foot in the door hoping to learn what you're never sure don't look too far it's here where you are only a cut of the deepest kind could break what i hold for you i know the cut will never be mine so do what you do
