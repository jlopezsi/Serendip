come to the church by the wildwood oh come to the church in the vale no spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale how sweet on a clear sabbath morning to listen to the clear ringing bells it's tones so sweetly are calling oh come to the church in the vale come to the church by the wildwood oh come to the church in the vale no spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale there she sleeps close by the church in the valley lies one that i love so well she sleeps sweetly sleeps neath the willow disturb not her rest in the vale come to the church by the wildwood oh come to the church in the vale no spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale there close by the site of that loved one neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom when farewell hymns shall be chanted i shall rest by her side in the tomb come to the church by the wildwood oh come to the church in the vale no spot is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale as the little brown church in the vale
