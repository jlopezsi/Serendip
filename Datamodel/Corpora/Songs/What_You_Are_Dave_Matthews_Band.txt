i walk into this room all eyes on me now but i do not know the people inside look straight through me these eyes seeking more wisdom than i have to give away realize realize what you are chorus what you've become just as i have are you and i so unalike huddled here you just as i am afraid if we dance we will die mock the world live safe say why don't you know when you give life then you become what you are the sea is unsparing we're all drifting away away from you but i pray for you now hoping to god on high is like clinging to straws while drowning oh chorus what you are is a best in a lover's arms what you are is the devil in a sweet sweet kiss what you are is a puzzle to me chorus
