don't know the reason why i think i've been here before this place seems so familiar but then i can't be sure here comes that time again when you'll walk right out the door don't tell me secrets anymore and fools don't run away you'll be followed another day and all the chances that fall your way are in the fire on your dying day so call me now and tell me that you're home can't see the sense in crying there's too many tears to fall my thoughts are multiplying so i'll try to save them all
