big brown bedroom eyes they're bad for me reluctantly you hit me to my vulnerability i don't like this feeling cause i can't see straight something says i met my match courtesy of fate i've always taken pride in my independence so afraid and careful not to show it no but you give me clarity like a bright green laser beam i think you want what's best for me in spite of my resistance be my eyes sing me i'm your song make me wise baby i'll be strong constantly the ones we love scorn us it's not for them to comprehend it's none of their business misery loves company i think you really know me and there's no coincidence my mama must have made me so we would find each other
