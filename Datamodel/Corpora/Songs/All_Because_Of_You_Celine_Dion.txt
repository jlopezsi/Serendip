thought i could define it one look in your eyes would have proved me wrong i find myself speechless this feeling of completeness is so strong and now as convinced that my heart had reached it's limit till you created this new place in it your touch wraps around in love that knows no boundaries now there's nothing i wouldn't do for you you're the answer i've been needing life doesn't hold no meaning now all because of you everything is different there's no frame of reference for the way i feel would you look at your face i'm still amazed i can't believe you're real i can lie here forever just watching you sleep hanging on every breath that you breathe your touch wraps around in love that knows no boundaries now there's nothing i wouldn't do for you you're the answer i've been needing life doesn't hold no meaning now all because of you all because of you mmmmmm
