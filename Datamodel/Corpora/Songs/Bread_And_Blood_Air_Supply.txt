i'm not afraid of losing you or saying good-bye if someone needs you more than me i will understand why i'd never stand between someone who's holding your heart but i can't let a superstition tear us apart who has the right to speak fire from above if heaven is away from you that is the place i will give up for falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup don't fill her mind with bread and blood don't confuse strength with pride and mud i have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood i'm not afraid to face the truth of what i believe if love was never meant to choose it could never succeed and we may always stand alone in everyone's sight and be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right who puts a price on eternity's sin who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again for you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain don't fill her mind with bread and blood don't confuse strength with pride and mud i have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood i won't see you cry should it make you cry don't fill her mind with bread and blood don't confuse strength with pride and mud i have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood don't fill her mind with bread and blood don't confuse strength with pride and mud i have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood
