one warm night i fell in love the air was still the words would flow we knew each other oh so well and though just met you'd never tell sometimes we're just lonely hearts that ride upon a floating card prepared to live those sleepless nights for precious time in paradise and now i find the future's gone the reasons that i had to carry on are gone i tried for it all she never heard me call at all there's no regrets we made the choice we listened to that silent voice that haunts you til you just give in and makes you like a child again we drifted close then said goodbyes just reading well each other's eyes the world had turned while we stood still and held on to each other and in between the right and wrong is somewhere that sometimes you can belong i tried for it all she never heard me call and now i find the future's gone the reasons that i had to carry on are gone i cried for it all she never heard me call at all
