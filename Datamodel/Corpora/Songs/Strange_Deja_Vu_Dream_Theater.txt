subconscious strange sensation unconscious relaxation what a pleasant nightmare and i can't wait to get there again every time i close my eyes there's another vivid surprise another whole life waiting chapters unfinished fading closer now slowly coming into view i've arrived blinding sunshine beaming through there's a house i'm drawn into familiar settings nothing new there's a pathway leading there with a haunting chill in the air there's room at the top of the stairs every night i'm drawn up there there's a girl in the mirror her face is getting clearer young child won't you tell me why i'm here in her eyes i sense a story never told behinde the disguise there's something tearing at her soul tonight i've been searching for it a feeling that's deep inside m tonight i've been searching for the one that nobody knows trying to break free i just can't help myself i'm feeling like i'm going out of my head tears my heart into two i'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew back on my feet again eyes open to real world metropolis surrounds me the mirror's shattered the girl why is this other life haunting me everyday i'd break through the other side if only i'd find the way something's awfully familiar the feeling's so hard to shake could i have lived in that other world it's a link that i'm destined to make i'm still searching but i don't know what for the missing key to unlock my mind's door today i am searching for it a feeling that won't go away today i am searching for it the only one i know trying to break free i just can't help myself i'm feeling like i'm going out of my head tears my soul into two i'm not the one i thought i always knew i just can't help myself i'm feeling like i'm going out of my head uncanny strange deja vu but i don't mind i hope to find the truth
