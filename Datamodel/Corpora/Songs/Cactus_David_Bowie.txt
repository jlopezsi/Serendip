sitting here wishing on a cement floor just wishing that i had just something you wore i put it on when i go lonely will you take off your dress and send it to me i miss your kissin and i miss your head and a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead run outside in the desert heat make your dress all wet and send it to me i miss your soup and i miss your bread and a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead so spill your breakfast and drip your wine just wear that dress when you're die d-a-v-i-d sitting here wishing on a cement floor just wishing that i had just something you wore bloody your hands on a cactus tree wipe it on your dress and send it to me sitting here wishing on a cement floor just wishing that i had just something you wore
