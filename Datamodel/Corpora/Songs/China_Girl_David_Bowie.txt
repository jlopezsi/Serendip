i could escape this feeling with my china girl i feel a wreck without my little china girl i hear her heart beating loud as thunder saw the stars crashing i'm a mess without my little china girl wake up mornings where's my little china girl i hear hearts beating loud as thunder saw the stars crashing down i feel a-tragic like i'm marlon brando when i look at my china girl i could pretend nothing really meant too much when i look at my china girl i stumble into town just like a sacred cow visions of swastikas in my head plans for everyone it's in the way of my eyes my little china girl you shouldn't mess with me i'll ruin everything you are i'll give you television i'll give you eyes of blue i'll give your man the words to rule the world and when i get excited my little china girl says oh baby just you shut your mouth she says sh-sh-shhh
