we stand shoulder to shoulder we see eye to eye we dive deep under water we jump high in the sky we stand shoulder to shoulder we stand side to side when one of us gets a tiny bit tired one gives the other a ride i've never had a best friend before so i can't be sure what it feels like but i think it feels more like this i think i feel more like myself when i'm with you finding losing and finding losing and finding making a bond that is strong building a house for our friendship breathing a breath for our song for our song
