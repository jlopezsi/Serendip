for certain she was the face of springtime the flowers stood and paid their due and all the folk they sang of a good rhyme while drinking all they wanted to a bitter sweet this final evening before he must leave her side they danced around the glass filled tables while fiddlers played so sweet and low their eyes hard fixed upon each other however would she let him go and when the time it came upon them she said in case we forget just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more the letters came and every single sunday we all would wait to hear the news she knew her love would be home someday the only thing she held on to we sang a song just like we used to and she said before we could leave just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more that night she heard her true love calling with words that only she could know they held each other till the morning and when it was his time to go she said just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more just a little bit more
