when the sun sets on the ocean when the yellow touches the blue when your heart begins to open i'll be so close to you when you're dreaming and i hold you remember that dream will come true when you wake up and you need me you'll know just what to do in the winter when it's raining and the sun can never shine through all those days of endless waiting i'll be thinking of you when thunder breaks the dawn when all muy strength is gone when shadows disappear i'll still be holding on when then sun sets on the ocean when the yellow touches the blue when your heart begins to open i'll be so close to you when you're dreaming and i hold you remember that dream will come true when you wake up and you need me you'll know just what to do in the winter when it's raining and the sun can never shine through when your heart begins to open when your heart begins to open when your heart begins to open i'll be thinking of you
