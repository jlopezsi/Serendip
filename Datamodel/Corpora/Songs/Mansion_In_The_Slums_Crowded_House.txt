i'd much rather have a cavern in the hills than a mansion in the slums the taste of success only lasts you half an hour or less but it loves you when it comes and you laugh at yourself while you're bleeding to death i'd much rather have a trampoline in my front room than an isolation tank i wish i was a million miles away from the manager's door there is trouble at the bank you laugh at yourself as you go deep into debt laugh at yourself while he's breathing down your neck who can stop me with money in my pocket sometimes i get it free the best of both worlds i'd much rather have a caravan in the hills i'd much rather have a mansion in the hills than a mansion in the slums yeah i'd much rather what i mean is would you mind if i had it all i'll take it when it comes and you laugh at yourself while you're bleeding to death and somebody else is always breathing down your neck laugh at yourself while he's hanging over your head the best of both worlds it'll soon be over
