blue morning blue morning wrapped in strands of fist and bone curiosity kitten doesn't have to mean you're on your own your can look outside your window he doesn't have to know we can talk awhile baby we can take it nice and slow all your life is such a shame all your love is just a dream are you happy where you're sleeping does he keep you safe and warm does he tell you when you're sorry does he tell you when you're wrong i've been watching you for hours it's been years since we were born we were perfect when we started i've been wondering where we've gone all your life is such a shame all your love is just a dream i dreamt i saw you walking up a hillside in the snow casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows one for sorrow two for joy three for girls and four for boys five for silver six for gold and seven for a secret never to be told there's a bird that nests inside you sleeping underneath your skin when you open up your wings to speak i wish you'd let me in all your life is such a shame all your love is just a dream open up your eyes you can see the flames of your wasted life you should be ashamed you don't want to waste your life i walk along these hillsides in the summer neath the sunshine i am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
