it's the darkest hour you're 22 the voice of youth the hour of dread it's the darkest hour and your voice is new love is lost and lost is love your country's new your friends are new your house and even your eyes are new your maid is new and your accent too but your fear is as old as the world say goodbye to the thrills of life when love was good when love was bad wave goodbye to the life without pain say hello your beautiful girl say hello to the greater men tell them your secrets they're like the grave oh what have you done oh what have you done love is lost lost is love you know so much it's making you cry you refuse to talk but you think like mad you've cut out your zone and the things have fold oh what have you done oh what have you done oh what have you done oh what have you done
