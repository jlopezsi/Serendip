painted sands and makeshift hands take us round and round horizon clear you'll soon be near and walking on the ground i've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight if you sail across the border we can float into the night oh i'm ready for you i'm ready for you i'm ready for you i'm ready for you cloudy sky the wind is high and trying to break the spell but i'll be here when you appear i'll see the nijtht as well a feeling's not a feeling if you can't believe it's true i'd sooner be believing til the ship comes sailing through oh i'm ready for you i'm ready for you i'm ready for you i'm ready for you i've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight if you sail across the border we can float into the night oh i'm ready for you oh i'm ready for you oh i'm ready for you oh i'm ready for you
