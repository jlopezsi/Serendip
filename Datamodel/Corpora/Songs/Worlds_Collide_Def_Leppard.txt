released on the cd-single for promises never gonna die now crawling from a wrecked jam i'm laughing out loud angel on my shoulder living at the speed of sound heavenly distraction i'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control choose your medication it's a generation overload i can see it falling from the sky can you feel me i can hear you calling when you cry can you see me pain and suffering your knees are tied will you hear me everchanging as your worlds collide running going nowhere take it to the limit then it's payback time nothing but a heartache waiting at the end of the line take a look around babe you're looking down the barrel of a loaded mind generation landslide crawling through the enemy lines i will be the one your justify will you hear me i will kiss you with a last goodbye i thought i was the one who could survive does anyone get outta here alive i gotta find the courage gotta make a change and start all over again taken for a ride against my will and taking it is always such a bitter pill shaken for the sake of it no more gotta get away cause i don't know what i'm doing it for i can see it falling from the sky can you feel me i can hear you calling when you cry can you see me i will be there when you close your eyes will you hear me everchanging as your worlds collide
