sat out a card game in a motel room don't let the muzak drive you crazy late at night they tell me it's all part of the deal i'm in well i close my eyes put memory into sight every time i see you smile now the lady tabs your case leaves you thinking an hour or so i hope she's right on time and you dream away your touchdown destination now single file and put yourself back in line but oh every time i see you smile now this old world don't give much for choosing you can spend a lifetime driving yourself wild but i can take it's punches laughing don't mind losing just as long as i get to see you smile every once in a while
