i can see hills touch the sky heaven and earth you and i a world we will always be here in the silence we lie shadows we cast you and i speak for eternity chorus pressed between pages flowers will die stories may end as time passes by you and i will always be with every word that i hear whenever whispers are near i can believe in fate promises made only one yesterday fades from the sun and falls to a new embrace years overflow as rivers run dry here in a moment of time passing by you and i will always be will always be chorus
