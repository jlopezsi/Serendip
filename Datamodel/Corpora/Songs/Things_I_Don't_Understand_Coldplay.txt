how tides control the sea and what becomes of me how little things can slip out of your hands how often people change no two remain the same why things don't always turn out as you plan these are things that i don't understand yeah these are things that i don't understand i can't and i can't decide wrong all my wrong from right day all my day for night dark all my dark for light i live but i love this life how infinite is space and who decides your fate why everything will dissolve into sand how to avoid defeat when truth and fiction meet why nothing even turns out how you planned these are things that i don't understand yeah these are things that i don't understand i can't and i can't decide wrong all my wrong from right day all my day for night or dark all my dark for light i live but i love this life
