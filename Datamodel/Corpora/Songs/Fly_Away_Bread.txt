now is the day we're on our way leave all your cares behind set your spirit free just say goodbye take to the sky we'll see what we can find come away with me we can fly fly away we will fly lookin for a dream see the stars above and the earth below us spinning come with me my love and we'll find a new beginning we can fly we will rise up and fly away fly away spread your wings and we'll fly away we will fly we will rise up and fly away lookin for a dream stay by my side and we will ride our silver charriot to the promisand land don't be afraid we'll have it made with all the love we got take me by the hand we can fly we will rise up and fly away fly away spread our wings and we'll fly away we will fly we will rise up and fly away lookin for a dream lookin for a dream lookin for a dream
