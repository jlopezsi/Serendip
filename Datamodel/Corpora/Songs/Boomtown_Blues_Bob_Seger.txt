southern sun ridin high winter nights warm and dry you've earned your space buddy you've done your time how come you've got no peace of mind lots of work everywhere lots of money honey gettin your share the folks back home say they'd love to be in your shoes so how come you've got those boomtown blues you can't miss that freezin rain you'd have to be insane to head back north and go through all that again no chill in the air no morning dew no change of seasons the sky always seems so blue the earth ain't black and the wind ain't cold all of a sudden now you feel so old somethin's wrong and it's cuttin deep you're feelin restless and it's hard to sleep look what you win but look what you lose stuck here in heaven with these boomtown blues
