i just cut the string on a dusty old shoe box and opened a door to the past now i'm sittin here with my souvenirs and these faded old photographs fightin back tears lookin back through the years and wonderin why dreams fade so fast now the young boy i see don't look like the me reflected in this old looking glass the man in the mirror sees things so much clearer than the boy in the pictures with his eyes full of dreams oh the men that i've tried to be from fifteen to forty-three never believed that they'd end up like me there's that touchdown i caught back when i thought i'd play for the cowboys someday there's you holding me in my faded fatigues comin home to the you s a one after another all my sweet dreams and lovers pass before my tear filled eyes pictures of a fool who was selfish and cruel till the day he made you say goodbye the man in the mirror sees things so much clearer than the boy in the pictures with his eyes full of dreams oh the men that i've tried to be from fifteen to forty-three never believed that they'd end up like me oh i never believed i'd be lonely like me
