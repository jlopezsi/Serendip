if i had one wish i'd make us drift away far from this place and you know better than me that i like it my way since the circumstance is weak i know that you are swallowing your pride when you look at me all i'm trying to say is that whatever you do it's okay baby i'll stay i am not a fool and it comes straight down to your p's and q's and mister i think you have me all wrong cause at the end of every day i like to lay my head your way and listen to your heart sing all i'm trying to say is that whatever you do it's okay cause baby i'll stay with you i'll stay with you
