there has to be a place for you and me where we can sleep and waters still run deep and you're the one that sails into me and you're the one whose lips are silent you're the one that always said there's only one forever it brought us both together there's only one forever you said to me just give me honesty and in return i'll build your santuary long ago that path was chosen how could we not fall in love remember when we always said there's only one forever it brought us both together there's only one forever you're the one that sails into me you're the one whose lips are silent you're the one that always said there's only one forever there's only one forever it brought us both together there's only one forever
