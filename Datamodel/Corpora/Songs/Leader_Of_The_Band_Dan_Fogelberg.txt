an only child alone and wild a cabinet maker's son his hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none he left his home and went his lone and solitary way and he gave to me a gift i know i never can repay a quiet man of music denied a simpler fate he tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait he earned his love through discipline a thundering velvet hand his gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old but his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul my life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man i'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band my brother's lives were different for they heard another call one went to chicago and the other to st paul and i'm in colorado when i'm not in some hotel living out this life i've chose and come to know so well i thank you for the music and your stories of the road i thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go i thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough and papa i don't think i said i love you near enough the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old but his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul my life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man i'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band i am a living legacy to the leader of the band
