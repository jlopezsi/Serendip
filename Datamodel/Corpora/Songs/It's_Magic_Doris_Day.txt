you sigh the song begins you speak and i hear violins it's magic the stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes it's magic without a golden wand or mystic charms fantastic things begin when i am in your arms when we walk hand-in-hand the world becomes a wonderland it's magic how else can i explain those rainbows when there isn't rain it's magic why do i tell me myself these things that happen are all really true when in my heart i know the magic is my love for you it's magic it's magic why do i tell me myself these things that happen are all really true when in my heart i know the magic is my love for you
