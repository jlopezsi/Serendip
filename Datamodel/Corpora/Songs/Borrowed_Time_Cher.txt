i turn my back on him now it's you that makes me smile but in your arms i'm restless like i'm leaving in awhile i let the match and burned my bridges you were mine now i got this feeling you'll be the next in line chorus living on the love of another man's woman that's loving on borrowed time like to make a song last forever but the next dance won't be mine living on the love of another man's woman that's loving on borrowed time my old love's broken pieces and i ain't met the new you're here in the middle hanging on until i do cause i'm a train that stops at every station down the line you're a fool so desperate that you'll ride on borrowed time chorus x3
