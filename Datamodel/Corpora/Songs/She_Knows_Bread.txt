and when my drug will start to get me down shes always there you know she always can be found and never lifted way to much on me she always seems to be in touch with me you see she knows and i am drawn to her it is as though i were a moth and she the candles glow and when the world has got the best of me shes seems to have the power to change my destiny i try to tell her what is on my mind and even though the words are hard to find she kknows that when she comes to me it is as though i were the earth and she new fallen snow and i will sing of all the things she knows she gives me wings with all the things she knows
