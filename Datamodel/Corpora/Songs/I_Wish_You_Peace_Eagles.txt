i wish you peace when the cold winds blow warmed by the fire's glow i wish you comfort in the the lonely time and arms to hold you when you ache inside i wish you hope when things are going bad kind words when times are sad i wish you shelter from the the raging wind cooling waters at the fever's end i wish you peace when times are hard the light to guide you through the dark and when storms are high and your your dreams are low i wish you the strength to let love grow on i wish you the strength to let love flow i wish you peace when times are hard a light to guide you through the dark and when storms are high and your you dreams are low i wish you the strength to let let grown on i wish you the strength to let love flow on i wish you the strength to let love glow on i wish you the strength to let love go
