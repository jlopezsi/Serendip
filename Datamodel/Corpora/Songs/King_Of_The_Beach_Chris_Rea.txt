let your fighting scars heal in the sun of a bright windy day let your cold blades sleep in the sand till it's rusted away washed each night in the waves while you sleep away each memory and you wake to find yourself a new king to be away from the dark moving into the light king of the shadows gives up on the fight he kicks of them shoes throws them away there's nobody here now except this salty blue day out of sight out of reach he's king of the beach whatever i was well i'm not that now i tell you because it may help you somehow so kick of them shoes and throw them away cause there's nobody here now except this salty blue day
