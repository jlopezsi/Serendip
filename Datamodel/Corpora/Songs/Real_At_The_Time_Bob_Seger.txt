i still remember how i fell for you there wasn't one thing i would not do i still recall the love in your eyes blue like the sky on a clear sunrise and it was real at the time real at the time i was yours you were mine it was real at the time you were a lioness tall and lean you were the best thing i'd ever seen i heard a loneliness in your voice i charged ahead i had no choice cause it felt real at the time real at the time like a mountain you climb it felt real at the time and babe you meant so much to me i never will forget your face i never will forget those nights those nights those nights lost in the pettiness and the fights lost in the battle for bragging rights we were a couple of kindred souls fighting for childish things like control but it was real at the time real at the time like the scene of a crime it was real at the time it was real at the time i was yours you were mine we got way out of line but it was real at the time
