when your baby up and leaves you up and leaves you flat don't you laugh my friend sometimes it happens just like that first you feel the anger then the sorrow will soon take control and there'll be hard times for sure long cold lonely nights it might not sound like much but it'll mean a lot you'll see every hour you survive will come to be a little victory little victory as you struggle through each day each strange new day feelin lost and wounded tryin hard to find your way no one there to talk it out with learnin how to sleep alone overcomin each new doubt tryin hard just to accept it all everytime you keep control when you're cut off at the knees everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease little victories little victories and when night falls and there's no one around the cruelest time of all and not one sound listenin to the wind blow listenin to the tickin of the clock tryin hard to forget tryin hard to just accept it all as you step out in the night take a lesson from the trees watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze little victories everytime you make it through it's another little victory day by day minute by minute little victories
