c'mon in welcome enter we've got you front roll center for the freak show parade everybody wants to be you but i know you see right through it sad mascaraed wrap your arms around me like a wire you reach into my soul pull out the fire chorus when i come undone i know you're the only one who can touch me when i call out your name when i come undone i know you're the only one who can put me back together again you've got what it takes to make me so won't you come and shake me out of this haze all to know those dreams you're sellin god knows man he's not tellin he's had better days awaitin here your voice above me callin you dragged me to my knees but i'm still fallin chorus i can't close my ayes can't hide the tear i feel the earth beneath my feet disappear i'm out of words i'm out of time give me your hand reach out for mine wrap your arms around me like a wire you reach into my soul pull out the fire chorus who can put me back together again
