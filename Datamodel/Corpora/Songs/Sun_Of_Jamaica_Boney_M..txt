long time ago when i was a young boy i saw that movie mutiny on thebounty starring my idol marlon brando and i felt a yearning for that great adventure so many nights i woke up out of adream a dream of blue seas white sands paradies birds butterflies and beautiful warm-hearted girls sun of jamaika the dreams of malaika your love is my sweet memory sun of jamaika blue lady malaika someday i'll return wait and see walk in the sand and i'm happy with you we shall be loving and true oh i sure love malaika with all of my heart i will always be faithful and true yeah true but now as i grew older the burning desire became so strong that i bought a tiket to fly home and then i found you and we found an eternal love right from the beginning the stars falling down from the lagoon of gold the palms swaying under the moon we were swimming out into the crystal sea in that fateful night i thought to myself i'll do everthing i can save every dime and one day i'll return and then i'll stay forever forever sun of jamaika the dreams of malaika your love is my sweet memory sun of jamaika blue lady malaika someday i'll return wait and see walk in the sand and i'm happy with you we shall be loving and true oh i sure love malaika with all of my heart i will always be faithful and true yeah true
