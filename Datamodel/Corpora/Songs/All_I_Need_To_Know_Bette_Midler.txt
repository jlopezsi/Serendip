look at my face i know the years are showin look at my life still don't know where it's goin i don't know much but i know i love you and that may be all i need to know look at these eyes oh they never see what matters and look at these dreams so beaten and so battered i don't know much but i know i love you and that may be all i need to know so many questions and still no answers i climb and climb but never get the view but when i hold you near me sometimes i feel so clearly the only truth i'll ever know is me and you in my heart i long for inspiration and in my soul i know someday i'll find salvation i don't know much but i know i love you and that may be all i need to know in my heart you're my inspiration and in my soul i know love is our salvation i don't kow much but if i know you love me that will be all i need to know i don't know much but if you say you love me that will be all i need to know
