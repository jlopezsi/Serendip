when the weather is fine and the clouds have gone by i go up in the air waving people good-bye in my flying machine i go up i go down i go round and round round and round and round people on the ground have gathered all around to admire there's a feeling inside me that gives me the urge to go higher but i know what goes up will eventually fall so i won't take no chances while i'm having a ball in my flying machine i go up i go down i go round and round and round and round i can race with the birds i can fight with the wind i can fly on my head i can dance in a spin
