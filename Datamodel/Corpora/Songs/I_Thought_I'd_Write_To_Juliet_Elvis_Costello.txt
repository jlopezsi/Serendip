i thought i'd write to juliet's for she would understand and when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down instead i find myself talking to you as my oldest friend tell me how i can advise someone that i don't even know to welcome death for i received a letter that is worth reporting and though it may raise a cynical smile it leaves a sinking feeling like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant have you seen my pride and joy you know the rest and it's no joke forgive me please as i quote this is a letter of thanks as i'm so bored here in i can't say where so i'm writing to people that i may never meet and i was thinking if something you said i'm a female soldier my name is constance i enlisted in the military needing funds for college i'm twenty-three years old and if i do get home alive i imagine i may think again i'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack your words are a comfort they're the best thing that i have apart from family pictures and of course my gas mask i don't know why i am writing to you
