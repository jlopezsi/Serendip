pictures of you race across my mind filling all the space there is to find melting love's own ice that lay so frozen i give that sacrifice for feeling chosen so if i face another day without you next to me i'll lock you in my mind and wish away the key chorus hope springs eternal when you're near all the passion reappears all emotion seems so strong hope springs eternal through your eyes draws me closer to your side and keeps me there where i belong given back the trust that was so fleeting captured by one my heart was seeking taken to my destiny's horizon searching for the moon we see it rising and in the silence of the night i hold you next to me feeling dreams take flight they set the spirit free chorus
