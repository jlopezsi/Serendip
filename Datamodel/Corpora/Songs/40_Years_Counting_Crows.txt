i was born in the jungle with the sickening smell of cinnamon in the air i was born in a white hole and i can't believe the colors here today stalk on a circle well i've never been blessed with elephant's memory riding a red line nowhere if it takes 40 years for the gun to be paid for if it takes 40 years i'll put the money away if it takes 40 years to get the things that i need sir if it takes 40 years i'll walk the thunder and the rain i was born in a good home where the rising cost of raising children was not a factor and you can't believe the things it does to me i'm filled with the white noise well i never did much of anything anyway jump on a big train no where chorus i wanna buy me a good heart and a conscience and maybe raise some children i wanna get me a good wife and a garden garden garden garden wanna start me a new life with a six foot color televisionwanna start me a new life somewhere i was born on a warm night on the right coast of southeastern america dead on arrival but you can't believe the things you hear today i'll fly me a white plane over water over blue and green and land in the ocean somewhere chorus
