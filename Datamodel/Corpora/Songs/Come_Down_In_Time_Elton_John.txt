in the quiet silent seconds i turned off the light switch and i came down to meet you in the half light the moon left while a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune a mantle of bright light shone down from a room come down in time i still hear her say so clear in my ear like it was today come down in time was the message she gave come down in time and i'll meet you half way well i don't know if i should have heard her as yet but a true love like hers is a hard love to get and i've walked most all the way and i ain't heard her call and i'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all come down in time i still hear her say so clear in my ear like it was today come down in time was the message she gave come down in time and i'll meet you half way there are women and women and some hold you tight while some leave you counting the stars in the night
