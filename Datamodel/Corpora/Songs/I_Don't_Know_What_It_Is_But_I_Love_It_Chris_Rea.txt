could it be just that i'm crazy could it be the way i feel this time of year when a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me i don't care when she's standing close beside me something turns inside me brings my senses to the point of no return and i don't know what it is but i love and i don't know what it is but i want it to stay and i love it and it seems to be around me even though no-one can see they seem to care when a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me i don't care when she's standing close beside me something turns inside me brings my senses to the point of no return and i don't know what it is but i love and i don't know what it is but i want it to stay and i love it
