dark and dirty like you have never seen a mind so twisted with thoughts so unclean my heart is racing all tattered and torn i stand here naked as the day i was born over and over i stand i'm holding the world in my hand i got to believe the sky is falling on this setting son echoes of silence ringing loud and long this isolation is the king of pain a lost horizon in an ocean of flames only the lonely will stand i'm holding the world in my hand i got to believe i've been here before but not as i stand here today i wait for the dawn ready to walk into the light
