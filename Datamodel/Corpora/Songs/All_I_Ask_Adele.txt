verse 1 i will leave my heart at the door i won't say a word they've all been said before you know so why don't we just play pretend like we're not scared of what's coming next or scared of having nothing left pre-chorus look don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is chorus if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends cause what if i never love again verse 2 i don't need your honesty it's already in your eyes and i'm sure my eyes they speak for me no one knows me like you do and since you're the only one that matters tell me who do i run to pre-chorus now don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is chorus if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends cause what if i never love again bridge let this be our lesson in love let this be the way we remember us i don't wanna be cruel or vicious and i ain't asking for forgiveness all i ask is chorus if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends cause what if i never love again
