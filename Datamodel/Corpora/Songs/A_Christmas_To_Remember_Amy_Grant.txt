twinkling lights a chill is in the air and carols everywhere close your eyes it's almost here candles and cards and favorite movie scenes the smell of evergreen as special as it's always been and i have a dream or two maybe they will come true chorus setting our hopes on a big snow tonight we'll wake up to a world of white it's gonna be a christmas to remember light up the fire play some nat king cole always sentimental and don't you know that it's gonna be a christmas to remember i know it's true time doesn't stand still many things can change but we know some things never will the memories we share the songs we always sing the mystery of life the hopefulness this season brings and i have a dream or two maybe they will come true chorus
