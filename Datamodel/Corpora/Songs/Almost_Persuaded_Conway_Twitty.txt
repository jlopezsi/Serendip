last night all alone in a barroom met the girl with a drink in her hand she had ruby red lips and coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any man then she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine i found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wine and i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride almost persuaded to put my conscience aside then we danced and she whispered i need you take me away from here and be my man then i looked in her eyes and i saw it the reflection of my wedding band and i was almost persuaded to let soft lips lead me on almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home
