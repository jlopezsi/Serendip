i've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me oh darling how i miss you i'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness i crave the silhouette of your kiss with only the blue light of the tv on lip reading threats and false alarms there's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself and a girl in a window on the reeperbarn chorus whenever i put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt that it's you that i'm dreaming about do i have to draw you a diagram all i ever want is just to fall into your human hands with the kings and queens of the dance hall craze checkmate in three moves in your heyday but the girls don't listen to your line anymore now you're part of someone else on the factory floor and you still say wheres the action now you manufacture happiness and get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction chorus all you toy soldiers and scaremongers are you living in this world sometimes i wonder in between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before tighter and tighter i hold you tightly you know i love you more than slightly although i've never said it like this before chorus
