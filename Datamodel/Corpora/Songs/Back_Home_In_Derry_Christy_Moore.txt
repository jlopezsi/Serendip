in 1803 we sailed out to sea out from the sweet town of derry for australia bound if we didn't all drown and the marks of our fetters we carried in our rusty iron chains we cried for our weans our good women we left in sorrow as the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled on the english and thoughts of tomorrow at the mouth of the foyle bid farewell to the soil as down below decks we were lying o'doherty screamed woken out of a dream by a vision of bold robert dying the sun burned cruel as we dished out the gruel dan o'connor was down with a fever sixty rebels today bound for botany bay how many will meet their reciever chorus oh i wish i was back home in derry oh i wish i was back home in derry i cursed them to hell as her bow fought the swell our ship danced like a moth in the firelight white horses rode high as the devil passed by taking souls to hades by twilight five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three we buried our comrades each morning in our own slime we were lost in a time of endless night without dawning chorus van diemen's land is a hell for a man to end out his whole life in slavery where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law neither wind nor rain care for bravery twenty years have gone by i've ended my bond my comrades ghosts walk behind me a rebel i came i'm still the same on the cold winters night you will find me chorus
