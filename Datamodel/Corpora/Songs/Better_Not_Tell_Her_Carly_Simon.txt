better not tell her that i was your lover better not make her jealous of me better convince her there was nothing between us i'm not those initials in your diary but if you slip and my name comes up don't deny that you knew me just leave out the white nights the moon in your window the break in your whisper the promises after better not tell her why you love spanish dancing don't bother to say that it's hot in the summer in madrid let it all go now like smoke from a candle like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind but if you slip and my name comes up don't deny that you knew me just leave out the white nights the moon in your window the break in your whisper the promises after leave out the tears and the laughter she won't need to know that i cried when you left that i think of you still but if you slip and my name comes up don't deny that you knew me just leave out the white nights the moon in your window the break in your whisper the promises after leave out the tears and the laughter she won't need to know that i'd die for your love that i still love you
