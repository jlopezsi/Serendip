hear the lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly the midnight train is winding low i'm so lonesome i could cry i've never seen a night so long where time goes crawling by the moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry the silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky and as i wonder where you are i'm so lonesome i could cry i'm so lonesome i could cry i'm so lonesome i could cry
