i feel like a boy with a problem i can't believe what we've forgotten and i even slapped your face and made you cry it's the last thing i want to do pull the curtains on me and you pull the carpet from under love pull out like young lovers do you swore you wouldn't shout if it's not your punch then its your pout days in silence try my temper nights spent drinking to remember how memories are always tender i crept out last night behind your back the little they know might be the pieces i lack came home drunk talking in circles the spirit is willing but i don't believe in miracles i've got a problem but let's go to bed i can roll over and i can play dead but here i am in the doghouse instead i feel like a boy with a problem i can't believe all you've forgotten sleeping with forgiveness in your heart for me
