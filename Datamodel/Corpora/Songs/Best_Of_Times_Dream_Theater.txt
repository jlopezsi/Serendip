remember days of yesterday and how it flew so fast the two score and a year we had i thought would always last the summer days and west coast dreams i wished would never end a young boy and his father idol and best friend i'll always remember those were the best of times a lifetime together i'll never forget morning shows on the radio the case of the missing dog lying on the fields at the only twelve watching harold and maude record shops the stick-ball fields my home away from home when we weren't together the hours on the phone i'll always remember those were the best of times i'll cherish them forever the best of times but then came the call our lives changed forever more you can pray for a change but prepare for the end the fleeting winds of time flying through each day all the things i should have done but time just slipped away remember seize the day life goes by in the blink of an eye there's so much left to say these were the best of times i'll miss these days your spirit led my life each day thank you for the inspiration thank you for the smiles all the unconditional love that carried me for miles it carried me for miles but most of all thank you for my life these were the best of times i'll miss these days your spirit led my life each day my heart is bleeding bad but i'll be okay your spirit guides my life each day
