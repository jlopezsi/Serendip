i'm so unhappy what'll i do i long for somebody who will sympathize with me i'm growing so tired of living alone i lie awake all night and cry nobody loves me that's why all by myself in the morning all by myself in the night i sit alone with a table and a chair so unhappy there playing solitaire all by myself i get lonely watching the clock on the shelf i'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder i hate to grow older all by myself
