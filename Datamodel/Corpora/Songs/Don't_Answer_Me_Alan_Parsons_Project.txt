if you believe in the power magic i can change your mind and if you need to believe in someone turn and look behind when we were living in a dream world clouds got in the way we gave it up in a moment of madness and threw it all away dont answer me dont break the silence dont let me win dont answer me stay on your island dont let me in run away and hide from everyone can you change the things weve said and done if you believe in the power of magic its all a fantasy so if you need to believe in someone just pretend its me it aint enough that we meet as strangers i cant set you free so will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me dont answer me dont break the silence dont let me win dont answer me stay on your island dont let me in run away and hide from everyone can you change the things weve said and done
