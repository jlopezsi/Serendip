night and day you are the one only you beneath the moon under the sun whether near to me or far it's no matter darlin where you are i think of you night and day night and day why's it so that this longing for you follows wherever i go in the roaring traffic's boom in the silence of my lonely room i think of you night and day night and day under the hide of me there's an ooh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me and this torment won't be through till you let me spend my life making love to you day and night night and day
