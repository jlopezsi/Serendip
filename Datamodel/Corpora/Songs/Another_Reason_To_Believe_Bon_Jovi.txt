love lives in new york city he got a place off of the park heard he was standing in the ruins and in his hands a broken heart he called an army of his angels i heard they had to hide their wings it was them who brought you water if you listen closely i know you can hear the choir singing chorus hey hallelujah baby rise up hold out your hands and reach out higher get up on your feet rise up let it flow though you baby run it through your veins like a healing rain everywhere you'll see another reason to believe i saw him down south of canal street right there in a mother's eyes at a table in a restaurant window in a taxi passing by love went running up the stairwell when the sky came falling down it was him in a newborn baby's cry he was there to make that sound that keeps this whole world spinning round chorus rise up hold out your hands and reach out higher get up on your feet rise up let it flow though you baby run it through your veins like a healing rain everywhere you'll see another reason to believe it's different than it was before now we need it even more fire's falling from the sky innocence just said goodbye it may never be the same maybe it was time to change a time to grieve a time to cry a time to live a time to fly
