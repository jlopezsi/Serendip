my first lesson in losin love was you learnin to live with your memory was lesson number two and i can't lie baby i still cry sometimes but i've come a long way towards gettin you out of my mind i'm still under the weather but i'm over the storm i still miss the shelter of your lovin arms but what i thought would kill me has just made me strong i'm still under the weather but i'm over the storm sometimes your memory still gets the best of me but that lonely ache in my heart ain't as bad as it used to be and sometimes the way that i'm feelin inside doesn't show but i know i'll get over you i've just got a long way to go i'm still under the weather but i'm over the storm i still miss the shelter of your lovin arms but what i thought would kill me has just made me strong i'm still under the weather but i'm over the storm i'm still under the weather but i'm over the storm
