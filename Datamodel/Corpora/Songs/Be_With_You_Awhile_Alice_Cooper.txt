i wish i could tell you something you didn't know i wish i could give you something you didn't owe i wish i could tell you a joke to make you smile and i could be with you awhile just want to be that someone you weren't looking for some nameless fascination that showed up at your door and when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile and i could be with you awhile i just want to take you somewhere you haven't been find an old time movie where we don't know the end lost in the radio drive another mile so i could be with you awhile just want to be that someone you weren't looking for some nameless fascination that showed up at your door and when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile and i could be with you awhile tired of serious conversation tangled up in situations i feel so free cause you want nothing from me just want to be that someone you weren't looking for some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor and when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile and i could be with you awhile just want to be that someone you weren't looking for some nameless fascination that showed up at your door and when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile and i could be with you awhile i just want to be with you awhile i just want to be with you awhile i just want to be with you
