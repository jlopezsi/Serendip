i keep singing the same old song like i did before when you left me you left me in darkness i'd never known before i was restless a fool for your time waiting round for you to call but now i've found me an angel of mercy i don't feel bad at all your body was honey i tasted a lot but let me tell you babe i need more than you got i want someone to hold me an keep me satisfied i need love i've got nothing to do ain't got nothing to say just live your life the way you know when you moved on you took all the sweetness was i a fool to let you go with the woman i forget for the moment all the times we knew before tho i'm still singing the same old love song i don't want you knocking on my door
