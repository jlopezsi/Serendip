across the concrete sky come walk with me something we need to know something we need to see is it love yes its love only love that is growing inside me if it's love yes it's love only love is the pillar of plenty you you make me feel this is all i need and it's all so real you help me understand where i want to be when i touch your hand i can see to the shadow of the sun we can be in the shadow of the sun untie the sails the shore will melt away without a trace i hear the raven say when it's love this is love when it's love that we must know we must enter this is love this is love only love when the dove is descended you are the winding stream going to somewhere that we ve never seen you are the dare to dream and the silent scream and the final prayer i can see to the shadow of the sun we can be in the shadow of the sun reach out for the shadow of the sun cry out for the shadow of the sun you are the colors of the wind singing hopes eternal spring in a symphony for every lonely year you are the keeper of the key and the one that longs to be the light for each and every frozen tear
