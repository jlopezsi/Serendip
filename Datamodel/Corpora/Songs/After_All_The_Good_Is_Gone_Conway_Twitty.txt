today i got a letter from someone just a friend we knew some time ago and as i read between the lines i began to realize he didn't know i'd lost you a long long time ago oh i just can't make it any longer everything i do is always wrong i'm just living a lie and there's no use in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone lord i wish that i could die and there's no use in trying to keep hanging on after all the good is gone
