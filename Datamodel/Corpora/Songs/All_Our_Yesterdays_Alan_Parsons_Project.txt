the stakes are high we have to seize the chance a case of do or die this is our last dance a moment's hesitation and we always pay the price hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice all our yesterdays will soon be ending hide the walking shadow on the stage all our yesterdays be soon forgotten there's an easy way to turn the page the vision is too real the prize is there to take we're on an even keel no demons in our way if you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven all our yesterdays will soon be ending hide the walking shadow on the stage all our yesterdays be soon forgotten there's an easy way to turn the page yesterday's tomorrow is tomorrow's yesterday find more lyrics at destiny's forgotten there's another game to play no more future perfect we just need the present tense all our yesterdays are only hanging in suspense hang the banners high on the outward walls the battles lost and won that's when the hammer falls racing to the future we must never lose our way all we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today all our yesterdays have come of age now we all can sing a different song all our yesterdays have all departed the writing on the wall will soon be gone all our yesterdays all our yesterdays now we all can sing a different song all our yesterdays all our yesterdays the writing on the wall will soon be gone all our yesterdays have come of age the writing on the wall will soon be gone
