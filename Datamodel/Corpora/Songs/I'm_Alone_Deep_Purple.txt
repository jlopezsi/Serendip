on the lonely road i'm travelling on the road that leads nowhere as the ground and the sky have been wondering why i'm alone so alone i've been rolling on for just two years the sun is my only friend with the wind on the bend and my back in my hand i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone and i feel like going home with my money spent my clothes all torn my spirit hanging low i ain't got no friends where the highway ends i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone i'm alone so alone and i feel like going home going home
