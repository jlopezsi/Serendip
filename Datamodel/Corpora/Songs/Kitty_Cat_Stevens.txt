i work in the mornin i work in the night the men on the block they just laugh at me i work in the mornin i work in the night the men on the block they just laugh at me but when they're wiping their silver spoons palming the men for some bread i'll be laughing way way out of my head when my little kitty gets out there's gonna be a party a party no doubt when my little kitty gets out there's gonna be a party and if my mind isn't coming so fast the men on the block say i'm on the brink and if my mind isn't coming so fast and i ain't so dumb as some people think cause when they're wiping their silver spoons palming the men for some bread i'll be laughing way way out of my head
