dismal day i look into my morning mirror and it reveals some things to me that i had not been able to see i saw someone that i'm not sure i want to be an empty lonely face was starin back at me all and all i would have to say it's been a rather dismal day the afternoon was slow in coming i drug myself outside the people that i knew would be there and though they walked along pretending not to care i knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare chorus and now the evening shadow's falling i guess it's best i lay my hopes to rest for no one's calling my name i sit and wait behind a door that's never knocked on i live in silence like my phone that's never talked on chorus
