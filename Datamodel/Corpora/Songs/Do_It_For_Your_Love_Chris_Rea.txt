each single day i get up and make my way and it all comes into view it's like a part in a play you can turn it around in so many different ways but it's still the part you play and so to you i dedicate this role they have handed me and i will do it for your love down in the street you can win or lose to that crazy beat but you'll never change the tune cause the tune is the song and song is the game of life we just come and go but we can laugh and we can bend together though me and you so i will do it for your love look around see that you see there's no sense in being so blue now i've got to have a reason for seeing this out other than seeing it through so i will do it for your love
