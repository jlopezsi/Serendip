chorus x2 i keep forgetting you don't love me no more i keep forgetting that you told me that you didn't want me around any more but these stupid old feet just head for your street like they've done so many times before and this stubborn old fist on the end of my wrist keeps a knocking on your front door chorus x2 i keep forgetting you don't love me no more i keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights and those heartbreaking things that you said though i know in my heart we're drifting apart i can't believe that our love is dead though it's plain as can be that you're finished with me i just can't get it through my head chorus x2 though i know in my heart we're drifting apart i can't believe that our love is dead though it's plain as can be that you're finished with me i just can't get it through my head chorus x5
