you came smilin softly shyly movin easy as a dreamer into my room and before i realized the danger i found myself looking into your eyes somewhere in their colors i saw promises of things i'd never seen before it's all over i've got to have you holding onto talking saying nothing knowing in a moment i could lose you then without a warning i remembered that you trembled at the touch of my hand knowing when you came to me that no one else would ever feel the same in my arms it's all over i've got to have you wakin in the morning to the tenderness of holding you asleep in my arms dreaming while my hair was blowing softer than a whisper on my cheek i don't know the feeling so i don't know if it's love but it's enough it's enough i can't help it i've got to have you it's all over i've got to have you
