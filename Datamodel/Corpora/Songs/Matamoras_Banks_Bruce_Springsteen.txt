each year many die crossing the deserts mountains and rivers of our southern border in search of a better life here i follow the journey backwards from the body at the river bottom to the man walking across the desert towards the banks of the rio grande for two days the river keeps you down then you rise to the light without a sound past the playgrounds and empty switching yards the turtles eat the skin from your eyes so they lay open to the stars your clothes give way to the current and river stone till every trace of who you ever were is gone and the things of the earth they make their claim that the things of heaven may do the same goodbye my darling for your love i give god thanks meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros banks over rivers of stone and ancient ocean beds i walk on sandals of twine and tire tread my pockets full of dust my mouth filled with cool stone the pale moon opens the earth to its bones i long my darling for your kiss for your sweet love i give god thanks the touch of your loving fingertips meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros banks your sweet memory comes on the evenin wind i sleep and dream of holding you in my arms again the lights of brownsville across the river shine a shout rings out and into the silty red river i dive i long my darling for your kiss for your sweet love i give god thanks a touch of your loving fingertips meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros banks meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros meet me on the matamoros banks
