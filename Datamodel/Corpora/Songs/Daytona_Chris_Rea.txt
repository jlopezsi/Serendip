diamond dream when the sun don't shine i close my eyes to see twelve wild horses in silver chains calling out to me oh daytona shine your light on me oh daytona shine your light on me now she ain't easy so you take good care or she will scream down on your lust she can please you like no other or she can leave you eating dust oh daytona shine your light on me burning passion heat my day let me sit inside your wonder cloudless daydream oh dance of dances to have tamed the sound of thunder oh daytona shine your light on me oh daytona shine your light on me
