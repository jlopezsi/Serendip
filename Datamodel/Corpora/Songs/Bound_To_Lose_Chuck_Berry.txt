looks like i'll go on through my life bound in sorrow i'm a loser right from the start now i've lost the only one i really loved and i'm bound to this pain in my heart i am bound because i am so much in love with you and i know that this love's all in vain when you let anyone have the love you say is mine it proves to me i'm a loser again i am bound with so many sweet memories of you what more can a poor loser do i can't change your ways i can't make you love me more i am bound to this crave i have for you i was bound to lose you when i first fell in love with you i thought i'd try and love again oh i lost but kept my chin up and i would pull through every time but losing you has laid my head in my hands
