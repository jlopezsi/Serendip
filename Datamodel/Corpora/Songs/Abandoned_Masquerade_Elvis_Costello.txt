music by diana krall lyrics by elvis costello the glitter on a paint and plaster face is covering desire and disgrace we could be lovers but no one suspects at all once you're inside that costume ball and now i'm sitting here before the mirror i have the skill still to disguise my tears then as the magic starts to fade i find myself abandoning the masquerade even though you're suffering you try to hide it and pretend you're so nonchalant you can cry a pool of tears and sit beside it then perhaps you'll know what you want i hope you never feel this much despair or know the meaning of that empty chair as the illusions that we made all fade away in this abandoned masquerade
