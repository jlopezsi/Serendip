let the wind blow let the grass grow but don't let her go don't take her out of my life don't take her out of my life let the moon glow let the moon glow on the fallen snow on the fallen snow let the moon glow on the fallen snow but i just got to know let me please know oh oh oh know she'll be a part of my life know she'll be a part of my life forever let the bees make honey let the poor find money take away their sorrows give them sunshine tomorrow but don't take her out of my life don't take her out of my life what would i do without her tell me now let the bird sing with the coming spring let the church bells ring let the rain fall let the grass grow let the moon glow on the fallen snow but don't take her out of my life please keep her a part of my life
