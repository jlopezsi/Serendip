here i am again waiting on the moment you decide to leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere i?ve been so close to you so many times i feel like i could drown i wish that i could fly away from here all but i?m still coming down aj from the last time all that you came around aj in the starlight all now i?m pulled into your gravity spinning helplessly i?m falling through the night like a lonely satellite aj like a lonely satellite nick we walked on jupiter flew around the moon a time or two left a mark on every star we could find but now i?m burning like a meteor that never hits the ground wish that i could fly away from you all but i?m still coming down aj from the last time all that you came around aj in the starlight all now i?m pulled into your gravity spinning helplessly i?m falling through the night like a lonely satellite nick love is poisoning the atmosphere is keeping everything unclear to me howie something in your eyes never satisfies i?m feeling so alone tonight all but i?m still coming down still coming down from the last time the last time that you came around you came around in the starlight the starlight now i?m pulled into your gravity ooooh spinning helplessly i?m falling through the night falling through the night yes i?m falling through the night falling through the night like a lonely satellite nick like a lonely satellite
