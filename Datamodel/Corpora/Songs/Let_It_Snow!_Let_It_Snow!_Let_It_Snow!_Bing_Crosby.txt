oh the weather outside is frightful but the fire is so delightful and since we've no place to go let it snow let it snow let it snow it doesn't show signs of stopping and i brought some corn for popping the lights are turned way down low let it snow let it snow let it snow when we finally kiss goodnight how i'll hate to go out in the storm but if you really hold me tight all the way home i'll be warm the fire is slowly dying and my dear we're still goodbying but as long as you love me so let it snow let it snow let it snow
