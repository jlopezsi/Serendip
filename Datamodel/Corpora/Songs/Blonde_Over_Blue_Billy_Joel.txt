some days when i'm far away in a lonely room in a cold seclusion some nights when i'm wound so tight there is no release there is no solution in hell there's a big hotel where the bar just closed and the windows never open no phone so you can't call home and the tv works but the clicker is broken but in the darkness i see your light turned on you know my weakness you know how i respond to chorus blonde over blue your hands are cold your eyes are fire blonde over blue they shine as though you're burning inside one word from you is all i need to be inspired blonde over blue i need your inspiration tonight these days there's a million ways to be pulled and torn to be misdirected these times there are sins and crimes on the morning shows for the disconnected i look and i write my book and i walk away with the wrong impressions i don't care cause i've done my share and i need some time for my own obsessions it doesn't matter i've let that life go by it's been forgotten cause all i wanted was you chorus these days not a damn soul prays and there is no faith cause there's nothing to believe in these days only good luck pays if we don't get paid then we try to get even i look and i write my book and i have my say and i draw conclusions some nights when i'm wound so tight there is no release there is no solution but in the darkness i see your light turned on you know my weakness you know how i respond to chorus
