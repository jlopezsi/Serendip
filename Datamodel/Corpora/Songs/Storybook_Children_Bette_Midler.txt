daybreak how can i ever leave this place beside you you were the only one i ever cried to the night is through now it's heartache i got to get home before he sees it's daybreak light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace i never really meant to stay and now it's daybreak we were just sitting and talking oh who would have thought we'd be spending the night dreading the light of daybreak how can i leave this place beside you how can i leave you baby leave you i don't want to go and now it's daybreak we were like storybook children hey but like all good fairy tales this one must end here is the end it's daybreak how can i ever leave this place beside you you were the only one i ever cried to the night is through lord knows it's daybreak and it feels like heartbreak i don't want to leave you i don't want to leave you i need you looks like it's daybreak but it feels like it's heartache i don't want to leave you don't make me leave you i need you daybreak sunlight shining through the lace i need you sun is smiling on your face i need you don't make me leave you lord
