i woke in the mornin wand'rin wasted and worn out i woke in the mornin wand'rin wasted and worn out wishin my long-lost lover will walk to me talk to me tell me what it's all about i was standin at the side road listenin to the billboard knock standin at the side road listenin to the billboard knock well my wrist was empty but my nerves were kickin tickin like a clock if i got anything you need babe let me tell you in front if i got anything you need babe let me tell you in front you can come to me sometime night time day time any time you want sometimes i'm thinkin i'm too high to fall sometimes i'm thinkin i'm too high to fall other times i'm thinkin i'm so low i don't know if i can come up at all black crows in the meadow across a broad highway black crows in the meadow across a broad highway though it's funny honey i just don't feel much like a scarecrow today
