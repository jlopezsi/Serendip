i hear the beating of your wings and you're playing on my strings in mysterious ways you draw me in to a love beyond all understanding beyond my reach so far away but it seems like only yesterday i'm haunted haunted is that what you wanted all that's left is the ghost of your smile it stays awhile then fades away i hear your footsteps on the ground tempting me to turn around it's just the echo of a disenchanted lover shuffling aimlessly homeward bound to empty rooms and picture frames and friends who can't recall our names i'm haunted haunted is that what you wanted all that's left is the ghost of your smile it stays awhile then fades away
