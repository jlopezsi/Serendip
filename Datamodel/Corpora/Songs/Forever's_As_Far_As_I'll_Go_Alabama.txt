i'll admit i could feel it the first time that we touched and the look in your eyes said you felt as much but i'm not a man who falls too easily it's best that you know where you stand with me chorus i will give you my heart faithful and true and all the love it can hold that's all i can do cause i've thought about how long i'll love you and it's only fair that you know forever's as far as i'll go when there's age around my eyes and gray in your hair and it only takes a touch to recall the love we've shared i won't take for granted you'll know my love is true cause each night in your arms i'll whisper to you chorus tag forever's as far as i'll go
