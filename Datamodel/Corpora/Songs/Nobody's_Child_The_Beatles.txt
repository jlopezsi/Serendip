as i was slowly passing an orphan's home one day i stopped for just a little while to watch the children play alone a boy was standing and when i asked him why he turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry i'm nobody's child i'm nobody's child just like the flowers i'm growing wild i got no mummy's kisses i got no daddy's smile nobody wants me i'm nobody's child no mummy's arms to hold me or sue me when i cry cause sometimes i feel so lonesome i wish that i could die i'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see and just like for the other kids it will be a home for me i'm nobody's child i'm nobody's child just like the flowers i'm growing wild i got no mummy's kisses i got no daddy's smile nobody wants me i'm nobody's child
