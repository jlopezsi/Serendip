astral engines in reverse i'm falling through the universe again down among a dead mans vision faded dreams and nuclear fissions span the strings of fear they are holding up the race the puppets falling to the ground the love i feel as i fly endlessly through space lost in time i wonder will my ship be found on this sinking ship i travel faster than the speed of life not so super nova burns the black holes turn and fade from sight the strings of fear they hide within the human race the answers buried underground the love i feel as i fly endlessly through space lost in time i wonder will my ship be found and very soon the boundless moon will show us light and as we crash we'll pray and kiss and say goodnight goodnight
