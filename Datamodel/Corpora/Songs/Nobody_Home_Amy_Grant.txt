main street u.s.a boarded up and dry knowin what once was here just makes me want to cry used to be the favorite place now what remains are memories even time cannot erase old man johnson's store where we grew up too fast all that remains today are echoes from the past used to be a boomin town all that's left is either broken up or broken down singing oh ah oh ah oh ah oh where we used to belong there ain't nobody home said oh ah oh ah oh ah oh you can knock all you want but ain't nobody home packed up moved away runnin from the past leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass used to be a busy town now everybody passes through but they don't stick around chorus was a newsstand on the corner right next to the barber shop and down the street there that's where all the kids would stop and they would tease the neighbor's bulldog laugh and run away now there's no one left who knows the truth in what you say chorus final chorus
