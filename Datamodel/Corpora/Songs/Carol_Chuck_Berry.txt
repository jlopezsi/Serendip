oh carol don't let him steal your heart away i'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day climb into my machine so we can cruise on out i know a swingin little joint where we can jump and shout it's not too far back off the highway not so long a ride you park your car out in the open you can walk inside a little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed oh carol don't let him steal your heart away i'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day and if you want to hear some music like the boys are playin hold tight pat your foot don't let em carry it away don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud oh don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd you can't dance i know you wish you could i got my eyes on you baby cause you dance so good oh carol don't let him steal your heart away i'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day don't let him steal your heart away i've got to learn to dance if it takes you all night and day oh carol
