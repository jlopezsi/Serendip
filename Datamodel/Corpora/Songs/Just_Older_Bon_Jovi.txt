hey man it's been a while do you remember me when i hit the streets i was 17 a little wild a little green i've been up and down and in between after all these years can you believe i'm still chasing that dream but i ain't looking over my shoulder chorus i like the bed i'm sleeping in it's just like me it's broken in it's not old just older like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans this skin i'm in it's alright with me it's not old just older it's good to see your face you ain't no worse for wear breathing that california air when we took on the world when we were young and brave we got secrets that we'll take to the grave and we're standing here shoulder to shoulder chorus i'm not old enough to sing the blues but i wore the holes in the soles of these shoes you can roll the dice til they call your bluff but you can't win until you're not afraid to lose well i look in the mirror i don't hate what i see there's a few more lines staring back at me the nights have grown a little colder hey man i gotta run now you take care if you see coach t tell him i cut my hair it's been all these years can you believe i'm still chasing dreams but i ain't looking over my shoulder chorus
