there are times that we are down and tired of runnin off the shore there are times that we can't take it at all and we let our feelings down chorus remember that i am your friend who will always be there for you whenever you're in pain just call out and hear me say i'll be there i'll be there i'll be there there are times we keep on losin our way and we go astray there are times that we can't make it at all and we let our feelings down repeat chorus
