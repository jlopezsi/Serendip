well it must have been good cause you said it was love i guess the day you left me it wasn't good enough now you're calling my number say you want to come back oh baby baby it's too late for that cause when you see me there'll be somebody new by my side somebody who is sure he is mine chorus when you see the smile on his face just remember baby could've been you could've been you when he's standing there in your place i hate to say it baby could've been you guess i should've been cool maybe i was too kind when loving me was easy you were hard to find when i cried over you baby how the teardrops burned oh baby baby now the table's turned so if those tears start falling when you see us walking by i hope you won't forget who said goodbye chorus should've been you but you threw it all away could've been you standing here today so if those tears start falling when you see us walking by i hope you won't forget who said goodbye you said goodbye chorus x 2
