once we were together once we were one once we were running we knew where we came from we were the music we heard the call we were giants after the fall once we were children once we were so small to the new horizons i cast my eyes when i look at you reaching out to the new horizons once and today once and today once we were divided once we lost our sight once we were freezing in the tv light you are a rainbow you're looking fine shall we make it one more time to the new horizons i cast my eyes when i look at you reaching out to the new horizons once and today once and today you are a rainbow
