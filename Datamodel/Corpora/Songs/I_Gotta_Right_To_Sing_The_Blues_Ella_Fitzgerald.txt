i gotta right to sing the blues i gotta right to feel low-down i gotta right to hang around down around the river a certain gal in this old town keeps draggin my poor old heart around all i see for me is misery i gotta right to sing the blues i gotta right to moan and sigh i gotta right to sit and cry down around the river i know the deep blue sea will soon be callin me it must be love say what you choose i gotta right to sing the blues
