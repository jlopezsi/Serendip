if all our flights are grounded libby we'll meet in paris dance along the boulevards and have no one to embarrass puttin on the ritz in style with an arab and an heiress libby we'll fly away hey leave behind our blues trade them all in for a paris breeze libby we'll fly see how dark the circles grow in a town that has no light so many eyes just staring out into the bloodshot night and libby i hate you to cry and i want to share it all with you and if it brings us to our knees we'll trade it all in for a paris breeze libby we'll fly they say it don't come easy they say that love is blind and if you're afraid to be close then love is hard to find and if you spend too much time winning love there's no time to be kind and libby i'm guilty of your crimes i'm just another passenger travelling on these crazy high seas very likely be the same in a paris breeze libby we'll fly if all our flights are grounded libby we'll go to paris and wish we were back home again or sailing on the ocean just a window and a drink to set our dreams in motion but libby we'll fly anyway hey and leave behind our blues half sung melodies trade them all in for a paris breeze libby we'll fly
