we walked on the beach beside that old hotel they're tearing it down now but it's just as well i haven't shown you everything a man can do so stay with me baby i've got plans for you this is the time to remember cause it will not last forever these are the days to hold on to cause we won't although we'll want to this is the time but time is gonna change you've given me the best of you and now i need the rest of you did you know that before you came into my life it was some kind of miracle that i survived some day we will both look back and have to laugh we lived through a lifetime and the aftermath this is the time to remember cause it will not last forever these are the days to hold on to cause we won't although we want to this is the time but time is gonna change i know we've got to move somehow but i don't want to lose you know sometimes it's so easy to let a day slip on by without even seeing each other at all but this is the time you'll turn back and so will i and those will be the days you can never recall and so we embrace again behind the dunes this beach is cold on winter afternoons but holding you close is like holding the summer sun i'm warm from the memory of days to come this is the time to remember cause it will not last forever these are the days to hold on to but we won't although we'll want to this is the time but time is gonna change you've given me the best of you but now i need the rest of you
