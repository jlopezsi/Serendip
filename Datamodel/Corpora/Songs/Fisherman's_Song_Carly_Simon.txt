in a pine forest cooler than the rest of the island lives a young fisherman with eyes like the sea he built his own boat and made his own cabin but he's broken the hearts of the likes like me now you must understand he made me a promise there were secrets we shared we planted a tree we lived in a cabin i fished along side of him i fell under the spell of his sorcery when he cast me adrift at the end of the summer it was not for another but his own privacy i fell apart like a rose but the scent of my longing remains and it weeps like an old willow tree at night when it's still with a yellow moon rising when his candle is snuffed and he's deep in a dream i move like a cat and crawl into his window and lie down beside him in a golden moonbeam the smell of his skin is just like the summer when our love was as fresh as the grass in the fields and ever so softly i kiss his eyelids before slipping away my secret concealed though i'm in it alone i'm still in it in love and love can be lonely like a sweet melody but just maybe he feels like a whisper inside him like an angel beside him keeping him company
