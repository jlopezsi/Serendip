sometimes when i'm sitting on my bed feeling so so lonely wishing someone hold me all i have is three little notes playing in my head outside i can cover all the scars inside lie the words just pleading to be heard cause all i have are three million melodies to kill all the hurt now i'm ready gonna sing em all out sing em out just for myself i don't even care what the world thinks about how i sound cause when i open my mouth my whole heart comes out every tear i wanna cry is satisfied i'm singing till i'm winning imma sing all night cause when i open my mouth there's no place to hide everything that i've been feeling runs wild and free i'm singing cause i'm winning imma sing for me i stand and believe in who i am take shots at my heart but who am i to give up everybody needs a melody to set their souls free my stage is the greatest in the world give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true reminding me to see my only chosen destiny and now i'm ready now i'm gonna sing it all out sing it out just for myself i don't even care what the world thinks about how i sound cause when i open my mouth my whole heart comes out every tear i wanna cry is satisfied i'm singing till i'm winning imma sing all night cause when i open my mouth there's no place to hide everything that i've been feeling runs wild and free i'm singing cause i'm winning imma sing for me sing for me sing for me sing for myself sing what i believe make my whole heart come out right where i am let the rain come down sing for me sing for me sing for myself sing what i believe let my whole heart come out right here right now make my own my very own sound cause when i open my mouth my whole heart comes out every tear i wanna cry is satisfied i'm singing till i'm winning imma sing all night cause when i open my mouth there's no place to hide everything that i've been feeling runs wild and free i'm singing cause i'm winning imma sing for me
