oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl and with the way you look i understand that you are not impressed but i heard you let that little friend of mine take off your party dress i'm not going to get too sentimental like those other sticky valentines cause i don't know if you've been loving somebody i only know it isn't mine alison i know this world is killing you oh alison my aim is true well i see you've got a husband now did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake you used to hold him right in your hand i'll bet he took all he could take sometimes i wish that i could stop you from talking when i hear the silly things that you say i think somebody better put out the big light cause i can't stand to see you this way alison i know this world is killing you oh alison my aim is true my aim is true
