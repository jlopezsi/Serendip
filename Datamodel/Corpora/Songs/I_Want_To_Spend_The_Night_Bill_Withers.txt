i want to spend the night with you forever every time we wind up spending the night together do you ever feel it i want to share my life with you forever ever time we wind sharing a night together do you ever feel it and when i stay away from you i never get to sleep i try to hug my pillow and pretend that you're with me but i can't feel it then when we are together it's right there for me to see i can't keep looking at loneliness and trying to call it freedom do you ever feel it i want to spend the night with you forever every time we wind up spending the night together do you ever feel it repeat x6 do you ever want to spend the night
