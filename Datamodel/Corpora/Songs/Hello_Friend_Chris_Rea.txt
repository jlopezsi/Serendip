hello friend where you been so long time goes by so easy it sleeps away just like a shadow at the end of the day hello friend how are things for you these days some guy from way-back-when he mentioned your name did he ever get back to you ah you know i told him to sometimes i turn and i swear i hear you call and i often wonder how we lost what we knew seems it gone in the wind washed away in the rain and the years go by and by the bridges you burned long sinced turned into ashes when there were no reasons now the river runs dry seems it gone in the wind washed away in the rain and the years go by and by where you been so long
