i've looked at it every way i can from under and above and every chance i've had my love went mad love went mad love went mad you you feel like i feel do you have a heart do you have a heart of iron and steel are you a man now you wear a man's hat are you a man now or are you a rat you go to church quiet as a mouse you're a big cheese now in the workhouse with these vulgar fractions of the treble clef i wish you luck with a capital f a self-made mug is hard to break a silent partner in someone else's mistake every day goes by without a hitch you feel the urge becoming an itch the boys in blue are hard to catch they're busy turning piccadilly into brands hatch but with your fingers in your ears feeling bright as a button thinking thank god there'll be no more lamb dressed as mutton playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb dying a thousand deaths in the safety of your own home
