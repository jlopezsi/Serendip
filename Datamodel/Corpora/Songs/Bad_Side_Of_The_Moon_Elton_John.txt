t seems as though i've lived my life on the bad side of the moon to stir your dregs in sickness still without the rustic spoon common people live with me where the light has never shone and the hermits flock like hummingbirds to speak in a foreign tongue i'm a light world away from the people who make me stay sitting on the bad side of the moon there ain't no need for watchdogs here to justify our ways we live our life in manacles the main cause of our stay exiled here from other worlds my sentence comes too soon why should i be made to pay on the bad side of the moon
