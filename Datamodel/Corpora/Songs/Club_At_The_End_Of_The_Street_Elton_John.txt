when the shades are drawn and the light of the moon is banned and the stars up above walk the heavens hand in hand there's a shady place at the end of the working day where young lovers go and this hot little trio plays that's where we meet that's where we meet me and you rendezvous in the club at the end of the street oh where we meet oh where we meet me and you rendezvous in the club at the end of the street from the alleyways where the catwalks gently sway you hear the sound of otis and the voice of marvin gaye in this smoky room there's a jukebox plays all night and we can dance real close beneath the pulse of a neon light there's a downtown smell of cooking from the flame on an open grill there's a sax and a big bass pumping lord have mercy you can't sit still you can't sit still
