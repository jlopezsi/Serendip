if a girl isn't pretty like a miss atlantic city all she gets in life is pity and a pat kindly name a star who hasn't won a contest or a pageant if she hasn't she just never gets to bat she must shine in every detail like a ring you're buying retail be a standard size that fits a standard dress when a girl's incidentals are no bigger than two lentils then to me it doesn't spell success frumpy faces that could cause ya to have temporary nausea do i have to hear a lecture such as that is a nose with deviation such a crime against the nation should i throw her into jail or drown the cat so she looks a bit off balance she possesses golden talents or is that a pill too bitter to digest oh she's got very nice deportment hmm but when they see that at ortmund's from the gallery they'll be throwing fruit
