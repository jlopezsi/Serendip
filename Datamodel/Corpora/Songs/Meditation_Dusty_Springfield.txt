in my loneliness when you're gone and i'm all by myself and i need your caress i just think of you and the thought of you holding me near makes my loneliness soon disappear though you're far away i have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay i just close my eyes and the sadness that missing you brings soon is gone and this heart of mine sings yes i love you so and that for me is all i need to know i will wait for you till the stars fall from out of the sky but what else can i do i will wait for you meditating how sweet it'll be when you come back to me just the memory of your little smile makes everything worthwhile you're so right for me there could never be anyone new could thrill me the way that you do no i won't forget for though you're gone i feel your nearness yet oh i will wait for you til the stars fall from out of the sky but what else can i do i will wait for you meditating how sweet love will be when you come back to me
