words and music by arlo guthrie the sun is sinking down i'm standing round my window you say you're going away but i believe in love chorus the power of love divine will surely shine you'll see and guide us to where we ought to be you and me the moon is coming up and i'm still here in prayer you say you've had enough and that you just don't care chorus but while the stars are coming out and light shines from above you tell me in my dreams that you believe in love chorus the sun is coming up a rainbow on my window you say you're going away and even though you do the power of love divine will surely shine you'll see and guide you home again to be you and me
