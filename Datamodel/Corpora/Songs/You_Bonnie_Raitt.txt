nobody else can make me happy no one could hurt me like you do you were the only one that mattered then you were gone love had moved on left me alone thinking of you there was never any other you and i were created to dream isn't it love that keeps us breathing isn't it love we're sent here for wasn't that love we were feeling deep in our soul deeper than we know keepin me whole there was never any question you are forever in my mind you and me were meant to be together i might as well have been dyin when we were apart when you came back i felt the beating of my heart you and i there was never any question you will forever hold my heart you and me were meant to be together you it was always you
