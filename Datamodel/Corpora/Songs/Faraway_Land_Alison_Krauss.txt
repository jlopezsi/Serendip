when years seem like days to me no time on my hands i run away to a place in me to a faraway land when home seems so far from me heaven's lights look dim it's just as far as my deepest heart where my heart's father lives his quiet voice speaking in silence everyday if i will only listen to the words he has to say i'll walk in his spirit see him in my face i will live cause he will live in my place when life seems so hard to bear when shadows look real the circumstance is your father's care go by faith not what you feel if you have been running too stop now in your tracks turn again to the one in you put your burden on his back his quiet voice speaking in silence everyday if i will only listen to the words he has to say i'll walk in his spirit see him in your face i will live cause he will live in my place when years seem like days to me no time on my hands i run away to a place in me to a faraway land
