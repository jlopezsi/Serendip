the light is long the sun is low i'm riding fast across this dusty road but i don't want to be no i don't want to be above the ridge an eagle flies in lazy circles in the western skies i want to fly with him i want to walk the spirit trail i've seen them come i've seen them go off to the oilfields and rodeos to find a better way they leave their native soil but i can hear a different song the drum within my heart is beating strong i want to follow it i've got to walk the spirit trail let every creature i see be a brother and a friend to me let every step that i take leave the footprints of a warrior along the spirit trail heya-heya heya hiyo heya-heya heya hiyo heya-heya heya hiyo the took the land they took control they robbed my father of his very soul to be like one of them to be like one of them but i was born a native son and i will never be another one to give it all away i've got to walk the spirit trail let every creature i see be a brother and a friend to me let every step that i take leave the footprints of a warrior along the spirit trail heya-heya heya hiyo heya-heya heya hiyo heya-heya heya hiyo let every creature i see be a brother and a friend to me let every step that i take leave the footprints of a warrior along the spirit trail
