lovers keep on the road you're on runners until the race is run soldiers you've got to soldier on sometimes even right is wrong they are turning my head out to see what i'm all about keeping my head down to see what it feels like now but i have no doubt one day we are gonna get out tonight maybe we're gonna run dreaming of the osaka sun ohh ohh dreaming of when the morning comes they are turning my head out to see what i'm all about keeping my head down to see what it feels like now but i have no doubt one day the sun will come out
