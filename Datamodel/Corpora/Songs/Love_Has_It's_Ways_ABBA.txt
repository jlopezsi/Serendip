spring in the air the sun was shining still the day was cool saw her waiting for a bus as she was going home from school looking so cold i took her home and that was just the start we would meet the summer through and she was always in my heart love has it's ways like seasons come and go and tomorrow there will be another day love has it's ways and so before you know when you turn around it may have gone away early that fall i knew i loved her more than anything gave her everything i had she even got a wedding ring but in the end the mind was restless and she had to go and the love i'd thought would live was buried in the winter snow love has it's ways like seasons come and go and tomorrow there will be another day love has it's ways and so before you know when you turn around it may have gone away love has it's ways like seasons come and go and tomorrow there will be another day love has it's ways and so before you know when you turn around it may have gone away
