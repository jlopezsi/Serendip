one day you're going to have to face a deep dark truthful mirror and it's going to tell you things that i still love you too much to say the sky was just a purple bruise the ground was iron and you fell all around the town until you looked the same chorus the same eyes the same lips the same lie from your tongue trips deep dark deep dark truthful mirror deep dark deep dark truthful mirror now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of roustabouts but you're never in any doubt there's something happening somewhere you chase down the road til your fingers bleed on a fiberglass tumbleweed you can blow around the town but it all shuts down the same chorus so you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks they set him up set him up on the stool he falls down falls down like a drunk and you drink til you drool and it's his story you'll flatter you'll stretch him out like a saint but the canvas that he splattered will be the picture that you never paint chorus a stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick a butterfly drinks a turtle's tears but how do you know he really needs it as a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand jesus wept he felt abandoned you're spellbound baby there's no doubting that did you ever see a stare like a persian cat chorus
