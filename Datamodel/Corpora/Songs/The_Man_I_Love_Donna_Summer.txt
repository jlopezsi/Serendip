spoken i just wanna say this this is something i thing most of you ladies will identify with and maybe some of you men too someday he'll come along the man i love and he'll be rich and strong the man i love and when he comes my way i'll do my best to make him stay he'll look at me and smile i'll understand and maybe for awhile he'll take my hand and though it seems absurd i know we both won't say a word spoken you know i'm the kind of lady that always seems to find the wrong man at the wrong place at the wrong time it's not that i go out looking for him but somehow he always seems to find me you see what i'm looking for is the kind of man that comes home with candy and flowers sayin come on put on your dancing shoes cause we're gonna wine and dine wine and dine but what i always seem to find is the kind of man that comes home fussing and fighting breaking my best dishes and beat my head outside the wall shows no love no respect and nothing at all
