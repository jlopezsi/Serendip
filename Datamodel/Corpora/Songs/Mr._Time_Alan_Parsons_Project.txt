stealing a moment from mr time he rocks in his chair like a shiny dime but it's all for show all for show wearing your name and a number or two when the minute's up so are you but everybody knows everybody knows watching the hour from the light in his eyes he waits for your soul to come in from the sky but it's lost below lost below turning the wheel of your destiny round when the motion stops no more sound does anybody care anybody care where's the man where's the child wrapped together side by side who can tell you what to do when mr time has come for you see the truth hear the lies can there be no compromise and who can tell you what they knew when mr time has come for you is it a feeling of deja vu when he points his finger calling you is it illusion just an illusion picking up seconds that fall to his feet he blows them away as rocks on his seat cool as his smile his smile where's the man where's the child wrapped together side by side who can tell you what to do when mr time has come for you see the truth hear the lies can there be no compromise and who can tell you what they knew when mr time has come for you
