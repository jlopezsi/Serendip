lyrics:bosson music bosson deeno i'm sitting in a place where the sun is shining looking up where the birds are flying not afraid as the sea is running high cause i know you are right by my side holding me when i'm feeling so small saving me when i'm starting to fall i'm about to fall but your standing tall the memories of you is a loving mother making sure we would stay together sometimes you're the bigger sister too when we needed someone to talk to always there with your arms open wide i know it's best but i can't stop wonder why it had to end this way grandmother she leaves today chorus it's over now there's a song that they sing in a big bright city yes it's over now there's a song and it's song by a choir of angels saving you from all your pain to heaven beautiful heaven singing for you it's been some time since you got the message you've been brave you've been strong all through this when they said there was nothing they could do you took care of the ones around you never felt sorry for yourself all you wanted was to live a little longer time you said to me but god is kind to you you see chorus and on and on the angels sing and on and on the choir sing for you beautfiful you and on and on and on and on and on and on we all will be together sooner or later together with you i miss the times when i stopped by i still remember our last goodbye you were standing in the door waiting for me like thousand times before chorus i miss the times i miss the times with you and this one's for you and this one's for you
