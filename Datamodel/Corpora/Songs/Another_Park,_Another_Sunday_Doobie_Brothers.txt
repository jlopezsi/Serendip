i'm sittin in my room i'm starin out my window and i wonder where you've gone thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn outside the wind is blowin it seems to call your name again where have you gone city streets and lonely highways i travel down my car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down i'm just tryin to find me a pretty smile that i can get into it's true i'm lost without you another lonely park another sunday why is it life turns out that way just when you think you got a good thing it seems to slip away it's warm outside no clouds are in the sky but i need a place to go and hide i keep it to myself i don't want nobody else to see me cryin all those tears in my eyes another park another sunday why is it life turns out that way just when you think you got a good thing it seems to slip away another park another sunday it's dark and empty thanks to you i got to get myself together but it's hard to do
