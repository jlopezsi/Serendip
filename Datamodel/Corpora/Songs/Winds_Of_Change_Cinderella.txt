i look into the mirror can almost count the years the memories are clearer of all those things i feared i watch the time pass slowly it comes and goes like the waves the sea can touch the sky at night it's got the freedom i crave i'm going through changes in my life i'm going through changes it'll be alright look into a picture a thousand years are told now is it any wonder what our tomorrows hold our yesterdays are over you know they go so fast if i could rule the winds of change you know i'd make it all last i'm going through changes in my life i'm going through changes it'll be alright alright i walked alone through the blackest night i felt the cold i felt the bite i took the high road but it ain't right it's just the low road in disguise i'm going through changes ah yea everything's gonna be alright yea got to the top of an uphill climb only to look down the other side just when you think it's on your side this world will show you ain't no reason to the rhyme i'm going through changes ah yea everything's gonna be alright times keep a changing every day watch out now cause it's heading your way ah yea seems like the world turned upside down seems like everything's falling down but it's all getting better every day watch out now cause a good times heading our way ah every day every day every day every day every day every day
