deep in the night i remember there i am reaching for you longing to turn to you that's all i want oh so much deep in the night i need you to touch me deep in the night i wait for daylight daytimes i always get through but when the sun goes down that's when i feel i feel oh so alone deep in the night i need you to hold me read a book and i think about you put it down and i think about you i make some coffee and i think about you wash up the cup and i think about you wind the clock and i think about you turn on the light and i think about you when i punch the pillow and i think about you deep in the night i feel lonely why didn't i try someone new it didn't work out i know but i know but i know because i try i try deep in the night i need you beside me deep deep in the night
