i was the boy who said all of my prayers laid my clean face on the pillow tucked in real tight so safe and secure through the night i heard a noise it was probably nothing it pulled me right out of a dream if i knew it was you i'd have jumped out of bed with a scream i am the one who growls in your closet i am the one who lives under your bed chorus get down back where you started get down back into hell your black soul you know you're black hearted i smell your sulfurous smell all of my things that i play with in daylight you turn into monsters at night my toys were my friends until you taught them all how to bite you showed me things little boys shouldn't see you scared me with visions of fire you danced on my bed with the flames on your head dancing higher i am the one who growls in your closet i am the one who lives under your bed chorus i tell you right now i don't want your reptile embrace i don't want to follow you down to your place i don't want to be a child of disgrace you can take your whiskey soaked foaming at the mouth toilet talking pea soup spewing sweating blood demon breath out of my face chorus i was the boy who said all of my prayers laid my clean face on the pillow tucked in real tight so safe and secure through the night
