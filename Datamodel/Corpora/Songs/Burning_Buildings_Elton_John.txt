it used to be a sweet sensation no price too high for love now i pay for this bitter taste and the price is not enough such cruel sport for your kicks such hard knocks on my heart how long before the pain ends tell me where living starts and lovers leap off burning buildings waking up on a sky high wire desperation leaves us clinging on the edge of a house on fire lovers leap off burning buildings live our life on borrowed time every flame that ever moved you touched your lips but never mine lovers leap off burning buildings no room for conversation cold stares and angry words fall in pieces from our faces we read do not disturb some lovers just go hungry others beg for just a bite you use me under pressure to whet your appetite
