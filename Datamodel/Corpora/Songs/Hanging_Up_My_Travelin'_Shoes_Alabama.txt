i've been goin around in a whirlwind not knowing which way to go i've been lost in a jungle of heartaches looking for what i don't know i've spread my wings and i've done some things that i never meant to do its took me some time but i've made up my mind i'm hanging up my travelin shoes chorus hangin up my travelin shoes my runnin around is all through i'm foldin my wings up for you i'm hangin up my travelin shoes i've been ridin a sea of uncertainty runnin away fom is all i've listened to nothing that life had to tell me watched all my dreams rise and fall i've made my mistakes but it's not too late to pull myself out of the blues its took me some time but i've made up my mind i'm hanging up my travelin shoes chorus hangin up travelin shows
