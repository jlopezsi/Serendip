falling through pages of martens on angels feeling my heart pull west i saw the future dressed as a stranger love in a space-dye vest love is an act of blood and i'm bleeding a pool in the shape of a heart beauty projection in the reflection always the worst way to start but he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately least of all a woman he doesn't know what a woman is he wants you for a possession something to look at like a painting or an ivory box something to own and to display he doesn't want you to be real or to think or to live he doesn't love you but i love you i want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings even when i hold you in my arms it's our last chance it's our last chance now that you're gone i'm trying to take it learning to swallow the rage found a new girl i think we can make it as long as she stays on the page this is not how i want it to end and i'll never be open again i was gonna move out get get a job get my own place but i go into the mall where i want to work and they tell me i'm i was too young some people gave advice before about facing the facts about facing reality and this is this without a doubt is his biggest challenge ever he's going to have to face it you're gonna have to try he's gonna to have to try and uh and and and get some help here i mean no one can say they know how he feels that so they say that in ya know like houston or something you'd say it's a hundred and eighty degrees but it's a dry heat in houston they say that oh maybe not i'm all mixed up dry until they hit the swimming pool i get up with the sun listen you have your own room to sleep in i don't care what you do i don't care when that door gets locked that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock if you're not in this house by nine o'clock then you'd better find some place to sleep because you're not going to be a bum in this house supper is ready there's no one to take my blame if they wanted to there's nothing to keep me sane and it's all the same to you there's nowhere to set my aim so i'm everywhere never come near me again do you really think i need you i'll never be open again i could never be open again i'll never be open again i could never be open again and i'll smile and i'll learn to pretend and i'll never be open again and i'll have no more dreams to defend and i'll never be open again
