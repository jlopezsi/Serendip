baby's gone my hand is trembling as the key unlocks the door my legs are shaky as i walk across the floor my voice weakens as i call out i'm home do my eyes deceive me or is my baby gone baby's gone she couldn't stand to tell me face to face and things just ain't the way they used to be around this place her perfume lingers where she once lay her head and i can almost taste the teardrops that she shed as she searched her mind and tried to find just where our love went wrong but it's ended and it's over baby's gone
