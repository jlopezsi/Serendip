hear the coyote howl he's found his prey at last in one moment of weakness the chase is over so fast he celebrates his kill no mercy in his eyes when you're born with the hunger the hunger never dies midnight is on the prowl and i hear it call my name danger lurks in the shadows but it's all part of a game until i quench this thirst i will not close these eyes when you're born with the hunger the hunger never dies you and i we're the same we both carry this flame to depths of our souls once this fever awakes we can never escape it's beyond our control we're all born with the hunger we're all born with the hunger temptation bites your lip one kiss ignites the fire so begins the seduction as we succumb to desire your body aches for more why are you so surprised when you're born with the hunger the hunger never dies when you're born with the hunger the hunger it never dies
