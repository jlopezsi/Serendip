if i could only go back again to the places where i have i have been feeling love as we did then if i could only go back if i could only go back crystal waters of yesterday golden rainbows you washed away lonely clouds that can only say if i could only go back if i could only go back to live in your arms again to love like we did then to run free as the wind forever silver wings of eternity take me back like the child to see faces lost in the memories if i could only go back if i could only go back to live in your arms again to love as we did then to run free as the wind forever run
