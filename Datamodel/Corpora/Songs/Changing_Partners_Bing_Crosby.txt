we were waltzin together to a dreamy melody when they called out change partners and you waltzed away from me now my arms feel so empty as i gaze around the floor and i'll keep on changing partners till i hold you once more though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part in that wonderful moment somethin happened to my heart so i'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then oh my darlin i will never change partners again though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part in that wonderful moment somethin happened to my heart so i'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then oh my darlin i will never change partners again
