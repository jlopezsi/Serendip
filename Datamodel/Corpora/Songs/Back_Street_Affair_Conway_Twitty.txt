you didn't know i wasn't free when you fell in love with me and with all your young heart you learned to care it brought you shame and disgrace the world has tumbled in your face because they call our love a back street affair they say you wrecked my home i'm a husband that's gone wrong they don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear for the one that i'm tied to was the first to be untrue and yet they call our love a back street affair we have each other now that's all that matters anyhow for the judgement of gossip's never fair we'll just be brave and strong then some day they'll see they're wrong so let em call our love a back street affair we'll be free to love someday when all the talk has died away and the happiness we hoped for then we'll share i'll climb a mountain high and then the world can hear me cry that our love's not a back street affair
