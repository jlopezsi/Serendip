i think i'll take my foolish heart my friend and head right for the door there'll be a better world waitin if i do cause i know i've been down this road a time or two before the only time i let my heart turn to you now i won't be blue with dreams that won't come true i'll take my heart and head right for the door still somethin deep inside keeps tellin me to make the sacrifice and askin me to walk the extra mile i've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles now i won't be blue with dreams that won't come true i'll take my heart and head right for the door i know i must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight and leave the moon up above to hold your gaze it's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride maybe some day i'll see the sunshine upon your face now i won't be blue with dreams that won't come true i'll take my heart and head right for the door i'll take my heart and head right for the door
