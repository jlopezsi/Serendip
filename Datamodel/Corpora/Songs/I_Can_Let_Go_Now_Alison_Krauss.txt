it was so right it was so wrong almost at the same time the pain and ache a heart can take no one really knows but when the memories cling and take you there till you no longer care you can let go now it's not right for me to cling to you somehow i just needed time from what was to be it's not like me to hold somebody down but i was tossed high by love almost never came down only to land where no love is found and i'm no longer bound i can let go now
