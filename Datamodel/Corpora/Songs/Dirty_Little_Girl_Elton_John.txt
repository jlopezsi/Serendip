i've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck i've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck that ain't nice to say sometimes i guess i'm really hard but i'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard when i watch the police come by and move you on well i sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear but all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs i'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl someone grab that bitch by the ears rub her down scrub her back and turn her inside out cause i bet she hasn't had a bath in years here's my own belief about all the dirty girls that you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl and like rags that belong to you i belong to myself so don't show up around here till your social worker's helped
