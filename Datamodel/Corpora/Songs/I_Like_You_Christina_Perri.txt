it's like a little piece of heaven when you stay you make me feel like it's all okay and now i know that the sun will only shine when the clouds go away cause that's how you make me feel that's how you make me feel today and you're like a little piece of candy on my tongue you're so much fun and i flip like a butterfly with one look in your eyes that's how you make me feel that's how you make me feel tonight and i think i like you and i think you like me too lets keep dreaming and wishing this way growups don't take enough time to play love is all that matters at the end of the day that's how you make me feel thank you for making me feel this way and i think i like you and i think you like me too
