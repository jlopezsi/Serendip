one day i'll stop breathing my heart will stop beating i won't see your face again this flesh and blood is weak and life isn't ours to keep sometime it has to end in time even memories fade away with time you might live to forgive and forget the mistakes that i made chorus i broke some promises sometimes i lied to you but one thing will always be true i'll never stop loving you fall from your grace you'll never be replaced god knows how hard i've tried but it just ain't no use i thought i could shake you loose i'm still torn up inside in time even memories fade away with time you might live to forgive and forget the mistakes that i made chorus x2
