i saw you on a screen an icon a legend a king i heard it in a song that's still goin strong a shooting star across the sky you kiss the earth and say goodbye chorus only the good die young only the good die young crashing into the sun only the good die young but they'll always be here i saw you in a dream fallin apart at the seams i heard it in your voice that you had no choice cos genius is a heavy load that leads you down the lonely road but love never dies chorus living inside our hearts and minds shining like a diamond in the sky you take me so far away a shooting star across the sky you kiss the earth and say goodbye chorus only the good die young only the good die young
