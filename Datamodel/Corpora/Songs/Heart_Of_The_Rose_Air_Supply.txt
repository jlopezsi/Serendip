graham russell a long time ago from the valley of the sun came the holy power when the gods were one searching for a new home searching for this land guided by the stars and a vision they had seen the pillars of the temple in these hills of green buried deep inside for only us to find chorus it is the roar of the wind the power of the sun the strength of a thousand bows and those who near it again will fear it again and it's here in the heart of the rose painted in the sky was the moment to awake all that lay within you as this dawn should break with this force awoken none can stand before this is the hour now is the time driven by the purest love i give you mine all that we must be is everything we see chorus our love has brought us both together and it's our love that will go on forever there is no love that can become as one before it's time chorus it is the trees in the earth it is the rivers that run and through us this secret flows and now our destiny calls you'll remember it all our love for the heart of the rose
