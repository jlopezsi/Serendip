words sung by the character in the movie given in brackets now i have nothing so god give me strength cause im weak in her his wake and if im strong i might still break and i don't have anything to share that i wont throw away into the air that song is sung out this bell is rung out this belle is wrung out he she was the light that i'd bless he she took my last chance at happiness so god give me strength god give me strength i can't hold onto him her god give me strength when the phone doesnt't't ring and im lost in imagining everything that kind of love is worth as i tumble back down to the earth that song is sung out this bell is rung out he she was the light that i'd bless he she took my last chance at happiness so god give me strength god if hed she'd grant me his her indulgence and decline i might as well wipe him her from my memory fracture the spell as he she becomes my enemy maybe i was washed out like a lip-print on his shirt see im only human i want him to hurt i want him i want him to hurt instrumental since i lost the power to pretend that there could ever be a happy ending that song is sung out this bell is rung out he she was the light that i'd bless he she took my last chance at happiness so god give me strength god give me strength
