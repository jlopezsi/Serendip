the further you get the better you see ooh yeah it all goes on and on infinitely the closer you are the better you see oh within within there is infinity worlds within worlds within worlds within worlds let your soul take you higher there are no bounds let your soul take you higher chase your fire out of love with empty souls oh look back from the stars and see we are dust it all goes on and on and we are the dust so why don't we laugh and whywhy don't we sing in endless chords and harmonies we're angels dancing round let your soul take you higher there are no bounds let your soul take you higher chase your fire out of love with empty souls
