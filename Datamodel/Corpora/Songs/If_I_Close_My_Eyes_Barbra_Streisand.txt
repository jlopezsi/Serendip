if i close my eyes i can fly i can drink the rain and taste the sky i can catch the wind and make it mine like the sun i'll shine suddenly a door opens wide to a thousand paths i've never tried follow follow me i hear them say and you'll find your way maybe dreams are dreamed so that we can see just how real the dawn can be how the dawn can be comes as no surprise if i simply close my eyes
