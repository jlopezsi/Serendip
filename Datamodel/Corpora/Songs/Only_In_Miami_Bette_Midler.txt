walking along the beach last night who do you think i spy a girl with ebony fire eyes soft and low do she cry now what could be such a source of pain i so boldly inquire pointing finger havana way these three words which transpire she told me that only in miami is cuba so far away only in miami my story she goes this way fish may fly through the purple keys golden birds take to air i am bound to the earth it seems my life can be so unfair only in miami is cuba so far away only in miami is cuba so far away standing on the shoreline waiting everyone anticipating i can hear the broken hearted say only in miami is cuba so far away and she cries for her child without a mother and she cries for her son without a father and she cries for herself without a lover can't face another day chase the blues away i thought i heard her mumble as she turned away only in miami is cuba so far away only in miami is cuba so far away standing on the shoreline waiting everyone anticipating i can hear the broken hearted say only in miami is cuba so far away only in miami is cuba so far away repeat x3 only in miami is cuba so repeat x4 only in miami is cuba so far away
