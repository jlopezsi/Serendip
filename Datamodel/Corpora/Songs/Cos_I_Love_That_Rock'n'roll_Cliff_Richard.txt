where has all that rock'n'roll gone oh won't somebody tell me where cause it used to be when i was young that you could hear them playing it everywhere but now it seems they're all so hooked on fashion the music's taken second place everyone it seems has one obsession to beat the others in the race and it just don't feel right to me no no it just don't feel right to me cause i love that rock'n'roll too much and i don't wanna see it ever waving goodbye yeah i love that rock'n'roll too too much and i couldn't bear to see it go by rock'n'roll you're too much to deny oh where has all that music gone there must be some mistake from something that was so much fun they were burning bridges in their wake o k everything has got to keep changing i know it has to be that way but isn't it too high a price we're paying we're losing most of yesterday and it just don't feel right to me
