just off of the beaten path a little dot on a state road map that's where i was born and where i'll die things move at a slower pace nobody's in the rat race and these days that's a special way of life chorus down home where they know you by name and treat you like family down home a man's good word and hand shake are all you need folks know if they're falling on hard times they can fall back on those of us raised up down home in the corner of the hardware store gathered round a checkerboard old men telling lies and crowning kings kids driving round the old town square tops rolled down in the cool night air go and see what's shaking at the dairy queen chorus when i was a boy i couldn't wait to leave this place but now i want to see my children raised down home down home folks know if they're falling on hard times they can fall back on those of us raised up chorus
