there's a poet in me that remembers and there's an honesty in every word there's a dancer that feels her own beat and there's a daughter who loves there's a sinner in my bones and there's a joker in my head there are secrets in my soul and there are sorries that i have never said but there's a time to dance time to laugh time to cry time to go time to grieve time to come oh i still got time to cope time to hope time to play time to grow but for now i gotta walk alone i gotta walk alone there's a tight rope that i've been walking there's a daisy in my hair there's a heartbreak that has taught me of what is raging and there's only love and fear there's a sadness in my confessions there's a healer howling at the moon and there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming and there's a an anger as i get closer to the truth but there's a time to dance time to laugh time to cry time to go time to grieve time to come oh i still got time to cope time to hope time to play time to grow but for now i gotta walk alone i gotta walk alone i gotta walk alone i've got to walk alone but for now i gotta walk alone oh i hear the thunder but i won't back down a soldier marches through the wrong side of town i'm gonna love you until i bleed and that's the story of me i gotta walk alone if they say time is everything there's a time to dance time to laugh time to cry time to go time to grieve time to come oh i still got time to cope time to hope time to play time to grow now i gotta walk alone i've got to walk alone i've got to walk alone i gotta walk alone for now i gotta walk alone
