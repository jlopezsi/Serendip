song lyrics what if i never knew what if i never found you i'd never had this feeling in my heart how did this come to be i don't know how you found me but from the moment i saw you deep inside my heart i knew baby you're my destiny you and i were meant to be with all my heart and soul i give my love to have and hold and as far as i can see you were always meant to be my destiny i wanted someone like you someone that i could hold onto and give my love until the end of time but forever was just a word something i'd only heard about but now you're always there for me when you say forever i'll believe baby you're my destiny you and i were meant to be with all my heart and soul i give my love to have and hold and as far as i can see you were always meant to be my destiny maybe all we need is just a little faith cause baby i believe that love will find a way hey oh baby you're my destiny you and i were meant to be with all my heart and soul i give my love to have and hold and as far as i can see from now till eternity you were always meant to be my destiny
