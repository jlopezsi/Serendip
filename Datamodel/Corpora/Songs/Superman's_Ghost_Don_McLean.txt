chorus i don't want to be like old george reeves stuck in a superman role i've got a long way to go in my career and some day my fame will make it clear that i had to be a superman verse 1 he came from another place deep in his mind as far as the planets in space as galaxy's mysteries start to unwind some changes are bound to take place though gravity constantly weighs on my travels my mission is close to adrift though i can be strong when my power unravels i still come to you for a lift chorus verse 2 i know i can fly when my plane hits the sky i believe i've got nothing to lose but when i'm alone with the bed and the phone i get the terminal metropolis blues i flew to the coast where superman's ghost lay shot on the bedroom floor he said watch out for tv it crucified me but it can't crucify me no more chorus verse 3 i'm red white and blue i've got justice to do i'm the man of your fantasy dreams but i'm an alien man from an alien land who's alive on your orthicon screens i once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled i performed for you live not on tape but the public is cruel when played for a fool as you see by the blood on my cape chorus verse 4 well i never was real or stronger than steel i'm a figment of freudian need and the video screen is a psychotic scene and it's all done with mirrors and green my agent just called the talks have been stalled i soon will be pulled from the air but the image persists in the video mists that a superman still will be there chorus
