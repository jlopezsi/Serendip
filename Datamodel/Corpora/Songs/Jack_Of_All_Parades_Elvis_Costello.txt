when we first met i didn't know what to do my old love lines were all worn out on you and the world walked round at my mouth they lit me up and they snuffed me out chorus and i was everybody's boy but soon that thrill just fades to be the love of one true heart or the jack of all parades you won't know who to thank you won't know who to blame it's just a part of the murdering game cause down in the fleshpots where they pay you in pounds they're laughing like drains and baying like bloodhounds for the jack of all parades the jack of all parades once i knew a girl that looked so much like judy garland that people would stop and give her money and everybody was frankie jimmy or bobby not the jack the jack of all parades oh the jack the jack of all parades oh the jack of all parades now the way that i feel is no longer news you know my love and how to refuse it cause you know where the door is and how to use it oh you know you do but from my checkered past to this shattered terrace where you can't keep your mind off the crimes of paris and you can't keep your peace and try to forget it and i can't forgive you for things you haven't done yet oh i was anybody's boy but soon that thrill just fades to be the love of one true heart or the jack of all parades when we first met i didn't know what to do my old love lines were all worn out on you and the world walked round my mouth i didn't mean to say it i just blurted it out as you pretended not to notice or be taken aback and i loved you there and then it's as simple as that oh i was everybody's boy but soon that thrill just fades to be the love of one true heart or the jack of all parades to be the love of one true heart or the jack of all parades oh the jack of all parades
