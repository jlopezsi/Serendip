imagination is funny it makes a cloudy day sunny makes a bee think of honey just as i think of you imagination is crazy your whole perspective gets hazy starts you asking a daisy what to do what to do have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then and then find it's only your imagination again oh well imagination is silly you go around willy-nilly for example i go around wanting you and yet i can't imagine that you want me too
