when you walked into my lonely life tonight i saw my destiny i saw eternity tonight and the moment i held you i knew it what we do is decided before we do it chorus fate this could only be fate i never thought i'd believe in fate now i understand it's part of the plan i was meant to be your woman time stood still and we lost on words to say and though the people stared they seemed a million miles away oh we knew it was love we were feeling we were destined to give it a whole new meaning chorus in my heart i feel i've loved you all my life i was in the dark but now i think i've seen the light i rang like a bell with your laughter something tells me i'll love you forever and ever fate this could only be it was fate this could only be it's part of the plan i was meant to be your woman it's part of the plan i'll love you forever and ever
