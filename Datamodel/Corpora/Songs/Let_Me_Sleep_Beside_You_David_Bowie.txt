baby baby brush the dust of youth from your shoulder because the years of fretting days are right behind you now don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds i will show you a game where the winner never wins let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore let me sleep beside you lock away your childhood and throw away the key for now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals we shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger child you're a woman now your heart and soul are free i will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore let me sleep beside you your darkened eyes throw mystery but your lips are void of history you could not imagine that it could happen this way could you i will give you dreams and i'll tell you things you'll like to hear let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore let me sleep beside you let me sleep beside you
