the time has come for closing books and long last looks must end and as i leave i know that i am leaving my best friend a friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong that's a lot to learn what what can i give you in return if you wanted the moon i would try to make a start but i would rather let me give my heart to you with love those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone yeah but in my mind i know that they live on and on and on and on but how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume well it's not easy but i'll try if you wanted the sky i would write across the sky in letters that would soar a thousand feet high to you with love those awkward years have hurried by why did they fly fly away why is it sir children grow up to be people one day what takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside what what is there that i can buy if you wanted the world i'd surround it with a wall i'd scrawl these words withe letters ten feet tall to you with love
