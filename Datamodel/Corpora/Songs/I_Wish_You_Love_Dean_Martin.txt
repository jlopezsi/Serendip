goodbye no use leading with our chins this is where our story ends never lovers ever friends goodbye let our hearts call it a day but before you walk away i sincerely want to say i wish you bluebirds in the spring to give your heart a song to sing and then a kiss but more than this i wish you love and in july lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade i wish you health and more than wealth i wish you love my breaking heart and i agree that you and i could never be so with my best my very best i set you free i wish you shelter from the storm a cozy fire to keep you warm most of all when snowflakes fall i wish you love
