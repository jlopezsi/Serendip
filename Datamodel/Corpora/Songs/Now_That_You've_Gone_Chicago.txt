take a closer look inside yourself you may see the love i left behind days were fast but full of life we laughed at everything now you've gone time is standing still i don't do anything i'm so alone so lonely still i can recall the happy times laughing arm and arm so alive was it years ago or just a day when you turned to me said goodbye now you've gone away i don't know why did you have to lie walk away how can i go on in emptiness feeling so alone every day
