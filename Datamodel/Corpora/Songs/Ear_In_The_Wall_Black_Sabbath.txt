hello can you hear me i might not be alone don't see anyone near me but i just won't go home again let's meet in the morning i just can't speak tonight this is more than a warning be silent till it's light and then you know i'll be there waiting for someone to believe me remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl i've seen an ear in the wall this time it could prove it but you've heard this all before cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone i need a witness somebody just like you so bring an exorcist a wizard and the holy ghost you know i'll be there waiting for someone to believe me remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl i've seen an ear in the wall one more reason one more time someone's searching through my mind now where am i supposed to go it's not who you are it's who you know what's it gonna be i knew you would answer i'm the curiosity you could miss a chance because the fool might see reality there it is in the corner you must be going blind what's wrong were you born before your god invented eyes it's got to be there grinding away at my secrets it's growing so dark and you can't see it all i'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall it's next to the eye in the wall
