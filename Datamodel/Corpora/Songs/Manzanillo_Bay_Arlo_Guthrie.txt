words and music by robb rabbitt mackay some times when the sun goes down and i'm lost in some other town my thoughts may drift away to manzanillo bay and i can see a fisherman his day's catch iying on the sand underneath the palms that sway over manzanillo bay chorus now i'm missing your silver moon black sands and your blue lagoon some day i would like to be back next to your shining sea drinking rum from a conch shell caught up in your magic spell some day i would like to go back down to mexico i remember your fields of cane your warm breezes and jungle rains and watching the children play over manzanillo bay and out in your market square the women sing out to sell their wares i've got fresh shrimp today from manzanillo bay chorus and under the spell of night the bay reflecting the harbor light you can hear the guitar play over manzanillo bay and if you're thinking about romance and you're willing to take a chance just pick any small cafe in manzanillo bay chorus some times when the sun goes down and i'm lost in some other town my thoughts may drift away to manzanillo bay
