featuring the crystal method music written by alan parsons ken jordan and scott kirkland lyrics by alan parsons you drink the wine you play the fool you cross the line you lose your cool but no one cares still no one cares you raise the bar lost in a trance one bridge too far no second chance but no one cares still no one cares we play the game we hold our own we fight to win we stand alone you had a dream you cast the dice your shady scheme you paid the price but no one cares still no one cares we play the game with hearts of stone you lose again you're on your own a turning tide a streak of light arms open wide the end's in sight and someone cares yes someone cares we play the game we hold our own we fight to win we stand alone
