would you believe me if i told you your tomorrow is my yesterday but be alive i know that we will the world keeps on moving but i'm holding still in the beginning i was far away and praying for my destiny that would arrive the moment you're born for we will be here when the miracle comes chorus living eyes when under the sun don't cry no war in my mind the state of my heart living eyes when out in the rain will fall the day i deny the face of my love bridge we are of age we are in time we are forever right now when the power is mine i leave you heaven and the earth i leave you never and living to love is the reason to shine i been over i been under i don't own a dream to analyze but living eyes you know that i do believe in the soul and the magic of you chorus bridge chorus
