here is a song from the wrong side of town where i'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound and it pounds from within and is pinning me down here is a page from the emptiest stage a cage or the heaviest cross ever made a gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid and i thank you for bringing me here for showing me home for singing these tears finally i've found that i belong here the heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets that cling to the backs of my knees and my feet well i'm drowning in time to a desperate beat and i thank you for bringing me here for showing me home for singing these tears finally i've found that i belong feels like home i should have known from my first breath god send the only true friend i call mine pretend that i'll make amends the next time befriend the glorious end of the line and i thank you for bringing me here for showing me home for singing these tears finally i've found that i belong here
