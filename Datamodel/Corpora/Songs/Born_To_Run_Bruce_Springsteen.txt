in the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway american dream at night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines sprung from cages out on highway nine chrome wheeled fuel injected and steppin out over the line h-oh baby this town rips the bones from your back it's a death trap it's a suicide rap we gotta get out while we're young cause tramps like us baby we were born to run yes girl we were wendy let me in i wanna be your friend i want to guard your dreams and visions just wrap your legs round these velvet rims and strap your hands cross my engines together we could break this trap we'll run till we drop baby we'll never go back h-oh will you walk with me out on the wire cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider but i gotta know how it feels i want to know if love is wild babe i want to know if love is real oh can you show me beyond the palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors and the boys try to look so hard the amusement park rises bold and stark kids are huddled on the beach in a mist i wanna die with you wendy on the street tonight in an everlasting kiss one two three four the highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide together wendy we can live with the sadness i'll love you with all the madness in my soul h-oh someday girl i don't know when we're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go and we'll walk in the sun but till then tramps like us baby we were born to run oh honey tramps like us baby we were born to run come on wendy tramps like us baby we were born to run
