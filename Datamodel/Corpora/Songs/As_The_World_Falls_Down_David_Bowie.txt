there's such a sad love deep in your eyes a kind of pale jewel open and closed within your eyes i'll place the sky in your eyes there's such a fooled heart beating so fast in search of new dreams a love that will last within your heart i'll place the moon within your heart as the pain sweeps through makes no sense for you every thrill has gone wasn't too much fun at all but i'll be there for you as the world falls down falling as the world falling down falling in love i'll paint you mornings of gold i'll spin you valentine evenings though we're strangers till now we're choosing the path between the stars i'll leave my love between the stars as the pain sweeps through makes no sense for you every thrill has gone wasn't too much fun at all but i'll be there for you as the world falls down falling as the world falling down falling as the world falls down falling falling falling falling in love as the world falls down down falling falling falling falling in love as the world falls down falling falling falling makes no sense at all makes no sense to fall falling as the world falls down falling falling falling in love as the world falls down down falling falling falling in love falling in love love falling in love falling in love falling in love
