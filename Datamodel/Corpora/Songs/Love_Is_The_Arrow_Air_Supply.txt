so many miles it seems nothing can come between your life and mine before the ink is dry i feel just you and i inside my mind love is the arrow fly straight and true into this deep and fallow hart what am i to do what am i to do another world to spin a distant tide come in they always do a mother holds the son a lover waits alone like me for you love is the arrow fly straight and true into this deep and fallow hart what am i to do what am i to do into the highest cloud before a word is spoken beyond the slighest doubt before the dream is woken
