i would be through with love have nothing to do with love if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you love hurt me from the start i'd still have a broken heart if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you you put your sweet lips on mine and i believed in love again the world took on a new shine and oh how sad it was then when love was so cruel to me how empty my life would be if it hadn't been for you and the little things you do my whole world would fall through if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you ooh ooh my whole world would fall through if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you if it hadn't been for you
