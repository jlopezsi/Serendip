gold-lloyd-echolette this is a national anthem from the flip-side of the empire hand on my heart heart on the sleeve of the constitution sinking right into a mirror leaving reflections on its surface caught in a kind of radio-beacon that's sending out signals transmitting them backwards hey tell me it's true is this the other side of you worlds gonna change with a move in your face do i still walk on the same structure hey what do we know re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows nothing is real even iron or steel melting gently in the cold structure watching your face thru a peephole as i lean against the door can't understand what you say but i think that you're calling my name leaving the ones i loved is like leaving the one they want me to be making decisions in real-time-precision as millions of sailors in parallelworlds hey tell me it's true is this the other side of you worlds gonna change with a move in your face do i still walk on the samestructure hey what do we know re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows nothing is real even iron or steel melting gently in the cold structure everybody walks this side of the run-way everybody hopes to get off the trap all we really like is to groove with emotion waiting for the airline to lift us up
