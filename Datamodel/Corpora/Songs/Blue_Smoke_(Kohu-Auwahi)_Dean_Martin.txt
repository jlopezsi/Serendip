blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky and when i think of home i sadly sigh oh i can see you there with loving tears in your eyes as we finally said our last good byes and as i sailed away with a longing to stay i promised i'd be true and love only you blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky my memories of home will never die blue smoke goes drifting by into the deep blue sky my memories of home will never die
