i have cried too i have cried too long i have cried too i have cried too long no more sorrow got to carry on found deep water before i've even learned to swim found deep water before i've even learned to swim never thought i'd see the sun again once i was a once i was a man alone once i was a once i was a man alone now i've found a heart to call my home like a phoenix i have risen from the flames like a phoenix i have risen from the flames no more living someone else's dreams i have cried too i have cried too long i have cried too i have cried too long no more sorrow got to carry on you almost had me old lady you almost tied me down good you played the lady in waiting and i waited as long as i could too long the songs have been silent too long the strings have been still i never knew what you wanted an i guess that i never will like a phoenix i have risen from the flames like a phoenix i have risen from the flames no more living someone else's dreams i have cried too i have cried too long i have cried too i have cried too long no more sorrow got to carry on
