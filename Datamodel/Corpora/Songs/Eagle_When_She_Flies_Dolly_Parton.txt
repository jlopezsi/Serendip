dolly parton she's been there god knows she's been there she has seen and done it all she's a woman she know how to dish it out or take it all her heart's as soft as feathers still she weathers stormy skies and she's a sparrow when she's broken but she's an eagle when she flies a kaleidoscope of colors you can toss her around and round you can keep her in you vision but you'll never keep her down she's a lover she's a mother she's a friend and she's a wife and she's a sparrow when she's broken but she's an eagle when she flies gentle as the sweet magnolia strong as steel her faith and pride she's an everlasting shoulder she's the leaning post of life she hurts deep and when she weeps she's just as fragile as a child and she's a sparrow when she's broken but she's an eagle when she flies she's a sparrow when she's broken but she's an eagle when she flies oh bless her lord she's an eagle when she flies
