black cats creep across my path until i'm almost mad i must have roused the devil's wrath cause all my luck is bad i make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains i try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains i guess i'll go through life kust catching colds and missin trains everything happens to me i never miss a thing i've had the measles and the mumps and every time i play an ace my partner always trumps guess i'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps everything happens to me at first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me that love would turn the trick to end despair but know i just can't fool this head that thinks for me i've mortgaged all my castles in the air i've telegraphed and phoned i send an airmail special too your answer was goodbye and there was even postage due i fell in love just once and then it had to be with you everything happens to me
