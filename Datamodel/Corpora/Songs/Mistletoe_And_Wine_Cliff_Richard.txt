the child is a king the carolers sing the old has passed there's a new beginning dreams of santa dreams of snow fingers numb faces aglow christmas time mistletoe and wine children singing christian rhyme with logs on the fire and gifts on the tree a time for rejoicing in all that we see a time for living a time for believing a time for trusting not deceiving love and laughter and joy ever after ours for the taking just follow the master christmas time mistletoe and wine children singing christian rhyme with logs on the fire and gifts on the tree a time to rejoice in the good that we see a time for giving a time for getting a time for forgiving and for forgetting christmas is love christmas is peace a time for hating and fighting to cease christmas time mistletoe and wine children singing christian rhyme with logs on the fire and gifts on the tree a time to rejoice in the good that we see silent night holy night
