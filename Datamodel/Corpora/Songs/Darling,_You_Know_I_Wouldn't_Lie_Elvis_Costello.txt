here i am late again for the last time and like i promised i just told her goodbye please believe me cause this time it's really over and darling you know i wouldn't lie didn't i come and tell you about her how temptation lured she and i now i know it was only fascination and darling you know i wouldn't lie i had to let her down easy as slow as i could after all she's got feelings too but it took a little longer than i thought it would but this time she knows we're really through she wanted to hold me forever and this lipstick shows her final try and these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed and darling you know i wouldn't lie
