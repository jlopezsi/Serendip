before you go away to the one you do belong so glad we met and you stayed though it wasn't very long was it only just a dream it's over now it seems if there were no goodbyes would you stay that you still care i won't believe my eyes when i see you won't be there cause this love so hard to find now you're leavin me behind oh please chorus show me and tell me how do you put this love aside and put it away for another time with no guarantee that you'll be mine a fool i am it seems cause i'll been lovin you in my dreams until i wake up and i find out that time ain't our friend i'll just stay a fool till the end till the end i'll be a fool till i find it's me and you if it only was game why'd you have to fool my heart oh girl ain't it a shame that we promised from the start that our love was here to stay for each and everyday if i had only known and if i didn't have to care then being all alone it wouln't be so hard to bear this love so hard to find that we're leavin here behind oh please repeat chorus i maybe over acting i know i must stay strong but you pulled the string too hard and now we're going on our own repeat chorus till the end you know i just stay a fool
