love i'll help you to see the world is ours it used to be but now it's changed so much we have to change it back soon will be a day when just a look will be to say let's break away today let's start again i'll tell you where i'll tell you when you came from out of the air and wrapped in fire said don't you be scared can't you use your life to save so many more cast my pride away and had me born again that very day and now i'm so alive i'm comin through they're teaching me to tell it to you oh i'm more the natural way to be it's the natural remedy with the natural guarantee oh your hearts would say my mind is gone and ran away but who's the loser if you don't know what i have a job that's hard to beat looking out for holey feet treading softly on the ground making waves but not a sound oh i'm more the natural way to be it's the natural remedy with the natural guarantee
