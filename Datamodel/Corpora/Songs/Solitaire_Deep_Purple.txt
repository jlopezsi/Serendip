door don't close the door i want to feel the cold i want to see the light momma where you gone this is no dream can't make it right if it's wrong dancing with strangers fighting with friends it's a matter of time between love and despair falling over the line empty hearts and icy stares call me solitaire the eyes in the face on the wall follow me round the room follow me everywhere a heart without an echo a man without a child alone with all my sorrow dancing with strangers fighting with friends it's a matter of time between love and despair falling over the line empty hearts and icy stares call me solitaire
