outside the carolers start to sing i can't descibe the joy they bring cause joy is something they don't bring me my boifriend is by my side from the roof are hanging sickles of ice their whiny voices get irritating it's christmas time again so i stand with a dead smile on my face wondering how much of my time they'll waste oh god i hate these satan's helpers and then i guess i must have snapped because i grabbed the baseball bat and made them all run for shelter it's christmas time again it's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year i'm growing tired of all this christmas cheer you people scare me please stay away from my home if you don't wanna get beat down just leave the presents and then leave me alone well i guess it's not cool to freak on christmas eve cause the cops came and arrested me they had an unfair advantage and even though the jail didn't have a tree christmas came a night early cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package it's christmas time again it's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year i'm growing tired of all this christmas cheer you people scare me please stay away from my home if you don't wanna get beat down just leave the presents and then leave me alone i won't be home i won't be home for christmas i won't be home i won't be home for christmas please post my bail i won't be home i won't be home for christmas please post my bail i won't be home i won't be home for christmas please post my bail i won't be home i won't be home for christmas please post my bail i won't be home i won't be home for christmas
