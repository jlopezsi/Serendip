he came to me like a bright idea shining like the sun and the way his eyes burned into mine i knew he must be the one oh he drew me in like a magnet does so i couldn't pull away but the kind of lovin that i gave to him i'm not ashamed to say oh as soon as i touched him soon as i touched him i felt like a woman and the feelin made me close my eyes soon as i touched i was born again an i heard myself cryin like a new born baby cries he told me what i meant to him swore that i was sent to him all my lovin went to him now he's gone oh he's gone now i hide myself from the light of day so no one else can see a part of him that i can't forget that's growin deep inside of me oh as soon as i touched him soon as i touched him i felt like a woman and the feelin made me close my eyes soon as i touched i was born again an i heard myself cryin like our new born baby cries soon as i touched him as soon as i touched him i felt like a woman and the feelin made me close my eyes soon as i touched him as soon as i touched him
