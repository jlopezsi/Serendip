no mercy no mercy no mercy in the midnight hush the restless hours between dark and light in dreams we come together underneath the cover of the night you're holding out but i'm holding on can't wait until your resistance is gone no mercy accept no defeat no mercy til you're here with me now the pressure's on you can run away but you can't hide you might as well surrender the walls are closing in on every side i'm getting closer now there's no escape victory is written all over my face no mercy accept no defeat no mercy til you're here with me no mercy i won't give in no no mercy til you let me in i won't take no for an answer i won't let go no mercy no mercy no ohh oh no mercy you're holding out but i'm holding on can't wait until your resistance is gone no mercy accept no defeat no mercy til you're here with me no mercy until you let me in no mercy no i'll never give in no mercy i won't let you go no no mercy and i want you to know oh no mercy
