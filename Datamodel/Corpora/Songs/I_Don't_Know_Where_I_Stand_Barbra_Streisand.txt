funny day looking for laughter and finding it there sunny day braiding wild flowers and leaves in her hair picked up a pencil and wrote i love you in my finest hand i wanted to send it but i don't know where i stand telephone even the sound of your voice is still new all alone in california i'm talking to you i'm feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that i had planned i guess it's too early cause i don't know where i stand crickets call courting the ladies in starred apple green thickets tall until the morning comes up like a dream how muted and misty such rouse and i'll take what sleep i can i know that i miss you but i don't know where i stand i know that i miss you but i don't know where i stand
