come my love come bravely to me let your heart be still for our time has come my tender one to be free of will and fly blind on fearless love let them wild winds blow we'll shine on all we're fearful of then we'll let it go let it go skippin stones across the great unknown safe at water's edge don't look down baby we're gonna leave this losin town and leap out from the ledge and fly blind on fearless love let them wild winds blow we'll shine on all we're fearful of then we'll let it go let it go
