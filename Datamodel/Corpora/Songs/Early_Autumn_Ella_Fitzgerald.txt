when an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze and touches with her hand the summer trees perhaps you'll understand what memories i own there's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down a winding country lane all russet brown a frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely that spring of ours that started so april-hearted seemed made for just a boy and girl i never dreamed did you any fall would come in view so early early darling if you care please let me know i'll meet you anywhere i miss you so let's never have to share another early autumn
