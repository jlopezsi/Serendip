there's a storm across the valley clouds are rollin in the afternoon is heavy on your shoulders there's a truck out on the four lane a mile or more away the whinin of his wheels just makes it colder he's an hour away from ridin on your prayers up in the sky ten days on the road are barely gone there's a fire softly burnin suppers on the stove it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm hey it's good to be back home again sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend yes and hey it's good to be back home again there's all the news to tell him how'd you spend your time what's the latest thing the neighbors say and your mother called last friday sunshine made her cry you felt the baby move just yesterday hey it's good to be back home again sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend yes and hey it's good to be back home again oh the time that i can lay this tired old body down feel your fingers feather soft upon me the kisses that i live for the love that lights my way the happiness that livin with you brings me it's the sweetest thing i know of just spending time with you it's the little things that make a house a home like a fire softly burnin and supper on the stove the light in your eyes that makes me warm hey it's good to be back home again you know it is sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend yes and hey it's good to be back home again i said hey it's good to be back home again
