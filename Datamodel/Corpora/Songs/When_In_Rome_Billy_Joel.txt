well i see you in the morning putting on your pretty clothes and i watch you do your make-up like they do in all those fashion shows then you turn to me so that i can see if you put yourself together right then you go away and you're gone all day but i know you're coming home tonight and when you're home darling all you've got to be is you but when in rome do as the romans do well it's alright if you're tired when your day is done you can see when you look at me you're not the only one it's a cold cruel world for a working girl but you can't let them see you cry it's a fact of life now man and wife work full time to just get by and when we're home all it's gonna be is me and you but when in rome do as the romans do i've done some strange things i never thought i'd do before but if the strain brings happiness more or less more or less then i don't mind masquerading with all those other fools i don't mind the games i'm playing because i've learned the rules and when times are tough i've got just enough if you're standing right by my side darling more and more i get hungry for all the ways you keep me satisfied on our own there ain't nothing that we can't get through but when in rome do as the romans do then i don't mind masquerading with all those other fools i don't mind the games i'm playing because i've learned the rules it doesn't matter when we're home all alone all we've got to be is me and you on our own there ain't nothing that we can't get through but when in rome do as the romans do swing that hammer and break that stone push those buttons and answer that phone coffee in the morning and martinis at night everybody's working up a big appetite do as the romans do
