he's a fine figure of a man and handsome too with his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo still he knows who knows who and where and how and i hope you're happy now he's got all the things you need and some that you will never but you make him sound like frozen food his love will last forever still he knows what you want and what you don't allow and i hope you're happy now i hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be and i know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me he's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after like a matador with his pork sword while we all die of laughter in his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat i hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that i knew then what i know now i never loved you anyhow and i hope you're happy now
