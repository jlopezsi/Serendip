all or nothing at all half love never appealed to me if your heart never could yield to me then i'd rather have nothing at all all or nothing at all if it's love there is no in between why begin then cry for something that might have been no i rather have nothing at all but please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek don't smile or i'll be lost beyond recall the kiss in your eyes the touch of your hand makes me weak and my heart may grow dizzy and fall and if i fell under the spell of your call i would be caught in the undertow so you see i've got to say no no all or nothing at all
