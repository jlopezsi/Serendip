there goes my young intended the thing has ended regrets are vain i'll never find another half so sweet and we'll never meet again i got impatient told him goodbye sad eyes out in the rain he was too good to me how can i get along now so close he stood to me everything seems all wrong now he would have brought me the sun making me smile that was his fun when i was mean to him he'd never say go away now i was a queen to him who's gonna make me gay now it's only natural that i'm blue he was too good to be true
