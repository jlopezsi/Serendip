hard as a diamond's eye soft as a last goodbye these are the things we learn to be calm as a distant light that shines on an island night these are the thoughts that say it's not too late to tell you i know i wanna tell you i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna be there to catch you from falling cold as the arctic ice hot as a passion's rise these are the days i spend alone pure as an infant's heart that beats through the light and dark these are the pictures of you always getting closer i wanna hold you closer i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna be there when love starts calling i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna be there to catch you from falling i only wish my heart could fly like it does when i sit and dream i'll never wake again as i hold you tenderly my thoughts were real and being with you now is the only thought that's strong it's a lonely night and i'm trying to hold on i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna be there when love starts calling i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna hold you tonight i wanna be there to catch you from falling
