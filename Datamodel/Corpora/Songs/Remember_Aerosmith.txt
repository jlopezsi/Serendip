seems like the other day my baby went away she went away across some sea it's been two years or so since i saw my baby go and then this letter came to me it said she found somebody new oh lemme think lemme think what shall i do oh no oh no oh no no no no no remember walking in the sand remember walking hand in hand remember the night was so exciting remember her smile was so inviting remember and then she touched my cheek remember with her fingertips remember softly softly we met with a kiss whatever happened to that girl that i once knew that girl that said she'd be true whatever happened to that night i gave her to you what will i do with it now oh no oh no oh no no no no no remember walking in the sand remember walking hand in hand remember the night was so exciting remember her smile was so inviting remember and then she touched my cheek remember with her fingertip remember softly softly we met with a kiss whatever happened to that girl that i once knew that girl that said she'd be true whatever happened to that night i gave her to you what will i do with it now
