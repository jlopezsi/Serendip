as i look at the letters that you wrote to me it's you that i am thinking of as i read the lines that to me were so dear i remember our faded love i miss you darling more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars above and with every heartbeat i still think of you and remember our faded love as i think of the past and all the pleasures we've had as i watch the mating of the dove it was in the springtime that you said goodbye i remember our faded love i miss you darling
