a hundred numbers on my wall some with names i sometimes call i drop a coin and watch it fall tryin to get connected to you a thousand hours all alone my softest pillow turns hard as stone this is the longest night on my own lying here thinking of you sometimes i shake my head and laugh to myself i'd like start again with somebody else i'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf chorus baby i could have been someone i could have been something it would have been nothing to die for you baby you're going to need me you'd better believe me it would have been easy to die for you a milloin memories flood my brain drown my sorrow kill my pain wets my thirst for you again just another night to get through all my neighbors scream for quite at my door shattered glass and torn up photos thrown on the floor well i couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore chorus these cuts are deep but you plead innocent are you hell or are you heaven-sent you're much too cold to know how much you meant to me yeah a billion tear drops fallen from my eyes but it's just a joke now and i'm laughing at your lies you made me hard as rock and now i realize chorus
