sleigh bells ring are you listenin in the lane snow is glistenin a beautiful sight we're happy tonight walkin in a winter wonderland gone away is a bluebird here to stay is a new bird he sings a love song as we go along walkin in a winter wonderland in the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is parson brown he'll say are you married we'll say no man but you can do the job you're in town when it snows ain't it thrillin though your nose gets a little chilly we'll frolic and play the eskimo way walkin in a winter wonderland in the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is parson brown he'll say are you married we'll say no man you can do the job when you're in town later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire to face unafraid the plans that we made walkin in a winter wonderland we'll frolic and play the eskimo way walkin in a winter wonderland
