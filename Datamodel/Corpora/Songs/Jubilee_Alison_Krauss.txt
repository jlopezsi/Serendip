the sun came up on monday morn the world was all in flame it's all a mortal man can do to make it right again swing and turn jubilee live and learn jubilee the moon came up i stood my ground and swore to not give in to never rest and do my best to rid this world of sin swing and turn jubilee live and learn jubilee the one who spoke cried tears of hope that we might change in time and when i looked into her eyes the fear i saw was mine swing and turn jubilee live and learn jubilee the time had come to travel on i made my way alone my soul will mend at journey's end this road will take me home swing and turn jubilee live and learn jubilee
