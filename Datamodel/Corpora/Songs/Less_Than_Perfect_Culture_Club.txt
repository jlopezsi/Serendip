i know a song ain't good enough to let you know how i feel i'll sing it hard i'll sing it sweet to let you know that it's real if i change my attitude maybe i can conquer you completely all the things i say and do everything i learn from you defeats me and i let you down i let you down i let you down i let you down i know it's wrong to blame the past for everything that i do i fool the world most of the time but there's no fooling you if i change my attitude maybe i can conquer you completely everything i say and do all i learn from you defeat me and i let you down i let you down i let you down i let you down i let you down let you down what you see ain't always what you get no matter how clear it seems one minute lovers then the next oh oh no oh no i let you down yeah yeah i let you down repeat x5 let you down let you down
