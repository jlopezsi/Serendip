moved out west just to get away miles of sky and empty space mirrors my soul i'm out here on my own i got a new job and a couple new friends there's even someone special i think i could start again but every time we touch it reminds me of us and chorus every time i close my eyes to go to sleep at night i wake up and i see your face even in my dreams i can't get anyplace i can't shake off your lovin chains your lovin chains so i moved back east just to face my tears to say what needs sayin before you disappear but old friends say you're gone long since moved on now chorus i think i'm never gonna climb this mountain of my feelings for you i'm gonna have to live here in your shadow until the skies are no longer blue chorus
