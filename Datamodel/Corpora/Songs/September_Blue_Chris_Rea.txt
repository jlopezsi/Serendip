your head spins round on a monday and the daylight's in your eyes how you laughed and cursed tomorrow now he's standing by your side you touched the stars at midnight the whole world seem to shout hello now your throat is tired and heavy and only one can go i'll be all right though i may cry the tears that flow they always dry it's just that i would rather be with you now and every time i see that star i will say a prayer for you now and forever september blue i'll be all right though i may cry the tears that flow they always dry it's just that i would rather be with you now and every time i see that star i will say a prayer for you now and forever september blue cause i'll always love you september blue
