i've been saying that i'd leave well enough alone now i'm behaving like i'm begging you for a bone when it feels good you can't help it you just hang by the phone and it felt that good last night i can't give it up you come on like a prince you got everyone convinced that you're a prince of a man but i'm the one who knows you i'm the one you show that you don't give a damn can't give it up oh no can't give it up i've been dreaming you'd fall in love with me no cold blooded scheming if it could be that easy but you still fight it and i must like it that i have to reach for what i want and as long as it feels that good i can't give it up i don't want to want you i don't want to want you cause you can't give can't give no i don't want you cause you can't give
