we took the highway till the road went black we marked truth or consequences on our map a voice drifted up from the radio we saw the voice from long ago chorus who'll be the last to die for a mistake the last to die for a mistake whose blood will spill whose heart will break who'll be the last to die for a mistake the kids asleep in the backseat we're just countin the miles you and me we don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore we just stack the bodies outside the door the wise men were all fools what to do the sun sets in flames as the city burns another day gone down as the night turns and i hold you here in my heart as things fall apart a downtown window flushed with light faces of the dead at five faces of the dead at five a martyr's silent eyes petition the drivers as we pass by who'll be the last to die for a mistake the last to die for a mistake whose blood will spill whose heart will break who'll be the last to die who'll be the last to die for a mistake the last to die for a mistake darlin your tyrants and kings form the same fate strung up at your city gates and you're the last to die for a mistake
