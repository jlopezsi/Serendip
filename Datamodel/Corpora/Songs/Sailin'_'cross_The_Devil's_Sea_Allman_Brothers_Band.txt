lately i don't know where i went wrong but the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong between her fine perfume and angel face my whole world became another place the dark side of her intelligence was so strong soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong next thing i know i had a key that unlocked her door i could not wait to hear the siren song the beginning of the end of my happy home sailin sailing cross the devil's sea oooh hooo too blind in love too blind to see heard them say the payback's double-fold just can't seem to remember who i bought and sold i'll probably still be here when you come around next year trying to climb from this deep dark hole i'll be damned if i just don't feel i'm growin old sailing sailing cross the devil's sea ohhh hooo too blind in love too blind to see cause she was eviler than evil slippery like a fox set me up with pain and woe and i swear it won't seem to stop if i could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul swear i'll leave and not come back just let me out that door sailin sailing cross the devil's sea ohhh hooo too blind in love too blind to see
