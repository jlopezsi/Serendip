every star has a twinkle every palm has a wrinkle every leaf comes from a tree i would agree so if everything is made up of two and the sky really needs the blue for my other half i'll settle for you every future has a past every first has a last every night has a day come what may so if everything is made up of two whether it be old or new for my other half i'll settle for you who wants to be like a sea without a shore the love just drifting forever more every smile has a frown all you gotta do is turn it upside down every house has a door of that i'm sure so if everything is made up of two i think it would be best if you know for my other half i'll settle for you don't you know i'll settle for you i'll settle for you if i had to settle baby i'll settle for you don't you know i'll settle for you
