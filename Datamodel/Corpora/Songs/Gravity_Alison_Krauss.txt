i left home when i was seventeen i just grew tired of falling down and i'm sure i was told the allure of the road would be all i found and all the answers that i started with turned out questions in the end so years roll on by and just like the sky the road never ends and the people who love me still ask me when are you coming back to town and i answer quite frankly when they stop building roads and all god needs is gravity to hold me down
