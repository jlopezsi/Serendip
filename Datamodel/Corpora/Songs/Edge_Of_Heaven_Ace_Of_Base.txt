fire i can see it burning so brightly fire i can feel it calling out to me and as the sun goes down it starts to paint a picture of an ancient town so far away across the endless sea lead me to the light and take me to the edge of heaven i'm standing in the night looking for the edge of heaven we'll be touching the edge of heaven time close your eyes see dreams of tomorrow time the wheels are turning till eternity and as the darkness comes i start to see a picture of a lonely man so clearly now reaching out for me lead me to the light and sail the endless sea so lead me to the light and take me to the edge of heaven the edge of heaven is near we'll sail the endless sea
