i used to think of myself as a soldier holding his own against impossible odds badly outnumbered and caught in a crossfire of devils and gods all i ever wanted to be was free all i ever wanted to see was within my eyes to see oh but these days are just like you and me these days are just like you and me you used to be something i could believe in how could you let me forsake myself so you used to think of your life as a riddle with no answer known all you ever wanted to be was free all you ever looked for was what was within your sights to see oh but these days are just like you and me these days are just like you and me we used to live like there was no tomorrow tasting our trials a day at a time laughing at sorrow and crying for justice such innocent crimes all we ever wanted to be was free all we ever looked for was what was within our eyes to see oh but these days are just like you and me these days are just like you and me just like you and me you know they're just like you and me
