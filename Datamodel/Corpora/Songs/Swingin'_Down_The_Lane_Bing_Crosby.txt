everybody hand in hand swingin down the lane everybody's feelin grand swingin down the lane that's the time i miss that bliss that we might have known nights like this when i'm all alone when the moon is on the rise honey i am so blue watchin lovers makin eyes like we used to do when the moon is on the way still i'm waitin all in vain should be swingin down that lane with you when the moon is on the rise honey i am so blue watchin lovers makin eyes like we used to do when the moon is on the way still i'm waitin all in vain should be swingin down that lane with you
