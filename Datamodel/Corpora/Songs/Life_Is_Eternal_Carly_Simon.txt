i've been doing a lot of thinking about growing older and moving on nobody wants to be told that they're getting on for a long long stay but just how long and who knows and how and where my spirit will go will it soar like jazz on a saxophone or evaporate on a breeze won't you tell me please that life is eternal and love is immortal and death is only a horizon life is eternal as we move into the light and a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight save the limit of our sight here on earth i'm a lost soul ever trying to find my way back home maybe that's why each new star is born expanding heaven's room eternity in bloom and will i see you up in that heaven in all it's light will i know you're there will we say the things that we never dared if wishing makes it so won't you let me know that life is eternal and love is immortal and death is only a horizon life is eternal as we move into the light and a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight save the limit of our sight
