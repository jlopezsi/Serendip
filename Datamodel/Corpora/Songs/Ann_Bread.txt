ann a-sleepin on my bed hair a-tumblin round your head you will always be apart of me when i look in your eyes it's my reflection i see ann i wonder how you knew i needed someone just like you were you on a beam of guiding light that came in my life late that september night and though i try to hold back the years i cannot hold the dawn and so i try to hold back the tears when love has grown up and gone ann i'll love you till i die and when you hear this lullabye i'll be with you though we're far apart and you'll be with me right here inside my heart
