oh they say people come they say people go this particular diamond was extra special and though you might be gone and the world may not know still i see you celestial like a lion you ran goddess you rolled like an eagle you circled in perfect purple so how come things move on how come cars don't slow when it feels like the end of my world when i should but i can't let you go but when i'm cold cold when i'm cold cold there's a light that you give me when i'm in shadow there's a feeling you give me an everglow like the brothers in blood sisters who ride yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died but the changing of winds and the way waters flow life as short as the falling snow now i'm going to miss you i know but when i'm cold cold in water rolled salt i know that you're with me and the way you will show and you're with me wherever i go and you give me this feeling this everglow oh what i wouldn't give for just a moment to hold yeah i live for this feeling this everglow so if you love someone you should let them know oh the light that you left me will everglow
