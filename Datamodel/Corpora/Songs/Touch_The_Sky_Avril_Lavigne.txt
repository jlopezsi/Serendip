used to carry this big old world on my shoulders and back i used to lie inside my room wondering where i am at i felt a chill running through my veins and wondered would i be saved i felt the ice building in my soul would it melt away he's a warm breeze breathing life into me he's the sunlight shining down on me i used to worry my life away counting every dime shutting out the ones i loved never finding the time and then one day i was overcome by loneliness and despair and deep inside i thought i heard lean on me i'm here he's a warm breeze breathing life into me he's the sunlight shining down on me i pulled the burden from off my back and tossed it into the wind and stretched my arms toward the sky and let my life begin and like a tree i have measured up best when i've been cut down and like a tree i can touch the sky with my feet on the ground he's a warm breeze breathing life into me he's the sunlight shining down on me he's a warm breeze breathing life into me he's the sunlight shining down on me yeah shining down on me shining down shining down shining down on me
