we met down in the valley where the wine of love and destruction flows there in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow i left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else you felt so good to me baby as good as life itself you were life itself rushing over me life itself the wind in the black elms life itself in your heart and in your eyes i can't make it without you i knew you were in trouble anyone could tell you carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell you squandered all your riches your love your beauty and your wealth like you had no further use for for life itself you were life itself rushing over me life itself the wind in the black elms life itself in your heart and in your eyes i can't make it without you why the things that we treasure most slip away in time til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart til we fall away in our own darkness stranger to our own hearts and to life itself rushing over me life itself the wind in the black elms life itself in your heart and in your eyes i can't make it without you so here's one for the road here's one to your health and to life itself rushing over me life itself the wind in the black elms life itself in your heart and in your eyes i can't make it without you life itself life itself life itself life itself
