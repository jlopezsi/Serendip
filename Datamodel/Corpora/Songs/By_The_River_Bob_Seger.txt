i was walkin by the river i held my hand out to feel the rain just a light rain almost a sun shower makin'all things shine again and i felt like i belonged i felt so strong as i walked on there was rhythm and there was order there was a balance there was a flow there was patience indulgence there was a power i could not know and i felt it all made sense the innocence the permanence i took my young son to the river i held his hand out to feel the rain
