she is trapped inside a month of grey and they take a little every day she is a victim of her own responses shackled to a heart that wants to settle and then runs away it's a sin to be fading endlessly yeah but she's alright with me she is leaving on a walkaway she is leaving me in disarray in the absence of a place to be she stands there looking back at me hesitates and then turns away she'll change so suddenly she's just like mercury yeah but she's alright with me keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds for the things that die before their time for the restlessly abandoned homes the tired and weary rambler's bones and stay beside me where i lie she's entwined in me crazy as can be yeah but she's alright with me
