god of the sun don't make me wait till the morning comes light in the sky look me in the eye eye eye eye don't keep me waiting around too much longer now don't don't keep me waiting around around around around when i called you from my river of darkness an echo was all that came back saw you wave goodbye down the railroad track sometimes when you're out and all alone and you can't find your way back wonder if you'll ever make it home god of the sun i'll be around till the day's begun one sight of your ray takes the night away away away away oh but when i walk through that door take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call i tell you not right now lady i got work on my mind and i'll talk to you soon always remember when i called you from my river of darkness an echo was all that came back i saw you wave goodbye down the railroad track sometimes when you're out and all alone and you can't find your way back wonder if we'll ever make it home no more
