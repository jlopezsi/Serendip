dear mother the struggle is over now and your house is up for sale we divided your railway watches between the four of us i fought over the pearls with the other girls but it was all a metaphor for what was wrong with us as the room is emptying out your face so young comes into view and on the back porch is a well-worn step and a pool of light you can walk into i'll wait no more for you like a daughter that part of our life together is over but i will wait for you forever like a river can you clear up the mystery of the sphinx do you know any more about god are you dancing with benjamin franklin on the face of the moon have you reconciled with dad does the rain still make you sad last night i swear i could feel you moving through my room and i thought you touched my feet i so wanted it to be true in my theater there is a stage and a footlight you can step into i'll wait no more for you like a daughter that part of our life together is over but i will wait for you forever like a river in the river i know i will find the key and your voice will rise like the spray in the moment of knowing the tide will wash away my doubt cause you're already home making it nice for when i come home like the way i find my bed turned down coming in from a late night out please keep reminding me of what in my soul i know is true come in my boat there's a seat beside me and two or three stars we can gaze into i'll wait no more for you like a daughter that part of our life together is over but i will wait for you forever like a river i'll never leave always just a dream away a star that's always watching never turn away we'll never leave always just a thought away a candle always burning never turn away the moon will hide the tree will bend i'm right beside you i'll never turn away
