so i walk a little too fast and i drive a little too fast and i'm reckless it's true but what else can you do at the end of a love affair so i talk a little too much and i laugh a little too much and my voice is too loud when i'm out in a crowd so that people are apt to stare do they know do they care that it's only that i'm lonely and low as can be and the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all so i smoke a little too much and i drink a little too much and the tunes i request aren't always the best but the ones where the trumpets blare so i go at a maddening pace and i pretend that it's taking your place but what else can you do at the end of a love affair so i smoke a little too much and i drink a little too much and the tunes i request aren't always the best but the ones where the trumpets blare so i go at a maddening pace and i pretend that it's taking your place but what else can you do at the end of a love affair
