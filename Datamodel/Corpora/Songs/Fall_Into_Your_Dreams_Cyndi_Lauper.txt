little baby on my shoulder i could fall into your dreams wrap myself up all around you till you don't know what it means don't lie shrugging your shoulders now like i shouldn't stare don't sigh so deep are you the kind of man that i hoped you would or wouldn't be maybe baby's gone to sleep maybe baby's gone to sleep pull myself a little closer i could feel your body breath hear the pulsing of my heartbeat rhyming rhythms endlessly if i could catch three wishes from a falling star one i would keep and two i would put on your pillow with a lullaby maybe baby's gone to sleep maybe baby's gone hold on to a thought at the end of the day someday we'll be watching the clouds as they're drifting away and you might think about leaving but i'll always stay little baby on my shoulder i could fall into your dreams wrap yourself up all around me till you don't know what it means i could fall into your dreams i could fall into your dreams maybe baby's gone to sleep
