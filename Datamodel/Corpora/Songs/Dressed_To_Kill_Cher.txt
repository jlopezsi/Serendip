i slip into my shoes and slide into the night i'm on the loose you're in my sights you know it's gonna hurt you but it's just no use you fall in love they always do and i'm waiting for the next one to fall i'm dressed to kill and you know that i will we're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart our heads will roll and blood will spill but how can you resist when baby i'am dressed to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill another lover struggles but it's all in vein you wear the scars and lipstick stains and he can't even see he's just another one it's far too late he's too far gone and i'm waiting for the next one to fall i'm dressed to kill and you know that i will we're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart our heads will roll and blood will spill but how can you resist when baby i'am dressed to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill how can you resist when baby i'am dressed to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill you know i'm the only one i can make you come undone you be a part of me from now until eternity i'm dressed to kill and you know that i will we're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart our heads will roll and blood will spill but how can you resist when baby i'am dressed to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill baby i'am dressed to kill to kill to kill to kill to kill
