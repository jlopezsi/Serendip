down in the street they're all singing and shouting staying alive though the city is dead hiding their shame behind hollow laughter while you are crying alone on your bed pity cassandra that no one believed you but then again you were lost from the start now we must suffer and sell our secrets bargain playing smart aching in our hearts sorry cassandra i misunderstood now the last day is dawning some of us wanted but none of us would listen to words of warning but on the darkest of nights nobody knew how to fight and we were caught in our sleep sorry cassandra i didn't believe you really had the power i only saw it as dreams you would weave until the final hour so in the morning your ship will be sailing now that your father and sister are gone there is no reason for you to linger you're grieving deeply but still moving on you know the future is casting a shadow no one else sees it but you know your fate packing your bags being slow and thorough knowing though you're late that ship is sure to wait sorry cassandra i misunderstood now the last day is dawning some of us wanted but none of us would listen to words of warning but on the darkest of nights nobody knew how to fight and we were caught in our sleep sorry cassandra i didn't believe you really had the power i only saw it as dreams you would weave until the final hour i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise sails almost slack in the cool morning rain she stood on deck just a tiny figure rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain sorry cassandra i misunderstood now the last day is dawning some of us wanted but none of us would listen to words of warning but on the darkest of nights nobody knew how to fight and we were caught in our sleep sorry cassandra i didn't believe you really had the power i only saw it as dreams you would weave until the final hour i'm sorry cassandra i'm sorry cassandra
