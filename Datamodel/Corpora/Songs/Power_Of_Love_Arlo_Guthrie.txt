by t-bone burnett the power of love can make a blind man see can bring a man to his knees the power of love can make a sultan grieve can make a skeptic believe chorus the power of love is south of south and scorches out all the doubt the power of love is the name of names and burns away all the pain the power of love can make a gangster cry can make a loser try the power of love can make a strong man weak can make a bigot meek chorus the power of love can make a coward brave can make a hero afraid the power of love can make a miser give can make a dead man live chorus chorus
