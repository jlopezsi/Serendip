by bob dylan i was sittin on a stump down in new orleans i was feelin kinda low down dirty and mean along came a fella and he didn't even ask he says i know of a woman that can fix you up fast i didn't think twice i said like i should let's go find this lady that can do me some good we walked across the river on a sailin spree and we came to a door called one-oh-three i was just about ready to give it a little knock when out comes a fella who couldn't even walk he's linkin and a-slinkin couldn't stand on his feet and he moaned and he groaned and he shuffled down the street well out of the door there comes another man he wiggled and he wobbled he couldn't hardly stand he had this frightened look in his eyes like he just fought a bear he was ready to die well i peeked through the key crack comin down the hall was a long-legged man who couldn't hardly crawl he muttered and he uttered in broken french and he looked like he'd been through a monkey wrench well by this time i was a-scared to knock i was a-scared to move i's in a state of shock i hummed a little tune and i shuffled my feet and i started walkin backwards down that broad street well i got to the corner i tried my best to smile i turned around the corner and i ran a bloody mile man i wasn't runnin cause i was sick i was just a-runnin to get out of there quick well i tripped right along and i'm a-wheezin in my chest i musta run a mile in a minute or less i walked on a log and i tripped on a stump i caught a fast freight with a one-arm jump so if you're travelin down louisiana way and you feel kinda lonesome and you need a place to stay man you're better off in your misery than to tackle that lady at one-oh-three
