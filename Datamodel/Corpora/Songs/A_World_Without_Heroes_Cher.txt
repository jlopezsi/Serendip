a world without heroes is like a world without sun you can't look up to anyone without heroes and a world without heroes is like a never ending race it's like a time without a place a pointless thing devoid of grace where you don't know what your after or if something's after you and you don't know why you don't know in a world without heroes in a world without dreams things are no more than they seem a world without heroes is like a bird without wings or a bell that never rings just a sad and useless thing where you don't know what you're after or if somethings after you and you don't know why you don't know in a world without heroes
