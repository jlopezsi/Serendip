verse 1 in the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face from the deepest part of my regret i hear the words i wish i'd said at the dawning of the day i can't wait to see the light make up memories in my head they help to fill the emptiness you've left hook i can't drown in your tears i won't face your fears i need to fight my own chorus you'll never see me again oh baby in time let the wait take me under i know i'll survive you'll never see me again
