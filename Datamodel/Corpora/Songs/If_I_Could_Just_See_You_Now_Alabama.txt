your love for me is gone but my love for you lives on and my memories of you will never die i can just see you now the special smile you gave to me the face i'll love eternally i see all the things you do your nearness seems so real to me as though you really care with me can't believe it's just a memory i can just see you now oh girl if i only could i wish with all my heart i could holding you would feel so good if i could just see you now i can just feel you now the tender sweetness of your lips as they brush across my fingertips i feel the softness on your mind so warm beside through the night holding you to the morning light oh did you really say goodbye i can just feel you now oh girl if i only could i wish with all my heart i could holding you would feel so good if i could just see you now i could just see you now the special smile you gave to me the face i'll love eternally i see all the things you do
