why do i say don't walk away you'll be the way your were before when you don't want me anymore don't turn around don't ever leave a lonely room where empty days are gathering to meet me when you're gonegone how in the world will i go on don't walk away all you gotta do is stay don't walk away all you gotta do is stay don't walk away chorus don't walk away don't say goodbye don't turn around don't let it die when shadows fall when day is done all through the night all of my life don't walk away is it a dream when will it end when everything we've ever known has ended and i'm all alone where will i go where will i be the feelings that i've never shown maybe i'll find the answer when you're gonegone how in the world will i go on don't walk away all you gotta do is stay don't walk away all you gotta do is stay don't walk away chorus
