strolling along country roads with my baby it starts to rain it begins to pour without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin i feel a shiver run up my spine i feel the warmth of his hand in mine oo i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love oo how i love the rainy days and the happy ways i feel inside after a while we run under a tree i turn to him and he kisses me there with the beat of the rain on the leaves softly he breathes and i close my eyes sharing our love under stormy skies oo i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love oo how i love the rainy days and the happy ways i feel inside break i feel the warmth of his hand in mine oo i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love oo how i love the rainy days and the happy ways i feel inside oo i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love oo how i love the rainy days and the happy ways i feel inside oo i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love oo how i love the rainy days and the happy ways i feel inside
