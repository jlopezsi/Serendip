by gregg allman c 1980 1981 1994 arista records inc transcribed by sam carle time and time again i've felt these wall's of plaster closing in and more than once i've felt that lonely lonely feeling wondering why and where i've been just about the time i think i can't hold on you're always there to keep me hanging on and i say i never knew how much a man needed a woman no i never i never knew how much a boy needed a girl needed a girl i never knew how much i needed you day after day i join the rat race tryin to make the most of it i keep on falling down down the ladder still trying to stay on top of it just when i was sure nothing could get no better oh i realize i still love you more than ever chorus today i watch the sun set on the freeway strangled on the poison air but miles beyond on the other end i know you'll always be waiting there girl you treat me with your kindest hand and in my heart in my mind and i'm so glad chorus
