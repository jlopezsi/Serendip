another song of woe woe sounds like this you say nothing's changed where were you when my world was spinning into masquerade you claim it's just a question of mathematics i shut the door on your amateur dramatics then you think too much and you talk too much vicariously yeah you think too much and you talk too much every word is substance free you're the dirt on my collar you're the hole in my favourite shoe you're the last dying breath of love you're the weight that i need to lose and you hurt yourself you say i'm deranged i'll admit to being strange but i just can't stop loving you if the light in your eyes addiction came as a surprise didn't think i'd be so into you then you think too much and you talk too much so carelessly yeah you think too much and you talk too much every word is substance free you're the dirt on my collar you're the hole in my favourite shoe you're the last dying breath of love you're the weight that i need to lose you're the dirt on my collar you're the hole in my favourite shoe you're the last last dying breath of love you're the weight that i need to lose you're the dirt on my collar you're the hole in my favourite shoe you're the last dying breath of love you're the weight that i need to lose
