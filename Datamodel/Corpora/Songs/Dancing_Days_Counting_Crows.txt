original by led zeppelin dancing days are here again as the summer evenings grow i got my flower i got my power i got a woman who knows chorus i said it's alright you know it's alright i guess it's all in my heart you'll be my only my one and only is that the way it should start crazy ways are evident in the way that you're wearing your clothes suppin boze is precedent as the evening starts to glow chorus i told your mamma i'd get you home but i didn't tell her i had no car i saw a lion he was standing alone with a tadpole in a jar chorus dancing days are here again as the summer evening grows you are my flower you are my power you are my woman who knows chorus
