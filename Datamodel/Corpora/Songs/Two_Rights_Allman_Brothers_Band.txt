you're coming back into my life after all this time apart after my heart has been broken in two now you want to turn around and go back through all the hurt all the pain i'm not sure it could ever be the same cause two rights can't make up for one wrong i've spend so many nights alone one kiss can't make it disappear even though you're here tonight baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone i guess you think it's all a game someone gets hurt someone gets blamed you don't seem to realize there's someone else in my eyes cause two rights can't make up for one wrong i've spend so many nights alone one kiss can't make it disappear even though you're here tonight baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone you're the one who wanted to play the field now you can't find a love that's real it's your game but it's no fun when you end up the lonely one cause two rights can't make up for one wrong i've spend so many nights alone one kiss can't make it disappear even though you're here tonight baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone
