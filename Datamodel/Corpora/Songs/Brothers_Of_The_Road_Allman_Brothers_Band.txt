silent shadows of the night faded with the morning light we just wrote another song maybe a word or two is wrong there's so much that could be said it's hard to write it in a line but when the final word is read maybe something could be said for all the brothers of the road just like you we bear a heavy load been through hell and back again if we don't lose we're bound to win somehow they gave it all a name just like a southern hurricane we play our music like a storm they say a brand new sound was born we're all brothers of the road just like you we bear a heavy load been through hell and back again if we don't lose we're bound to win some of us fell along the way we came together not too proud to pray but the music must go on so there's no one left out there all alone we're just brothers of the road casting shadows in the night big wheels rolling on and on but everything's gonna be all right
