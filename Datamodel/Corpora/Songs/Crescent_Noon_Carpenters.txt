green september burned to october brown bare november led to december's frozen ground the seasons stumbled round our drifting lives are bound to a falling crescent noon feather clouds cry a vale of tears to earth morning breaks and no one sees the quiet mountain birth dressed in a brand new day the sun is on its way to a falling crescent noon somewhere in a fairytale forest lies one answer that is waiting to be heard you and i were born like the breaking day all our seasons all our green septembers burn away slowly we'll fade into a sea of midnight blue and a falling crescent noon
