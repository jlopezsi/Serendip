a lady stands before an open window looking so far away she can almost feel the southern winds blow gently touching his restless day he turns from his window to me sad smile his apology sad eyes reaching to the door daylight loses to another evening still he spares me words goodbye sits alone beside me fighting his feelings struggles to speak but in the end can only cry suddenly it's so hard to find the sound of the words to speak his troubled mind so i'm offering ease to him as if to be kind there's a train every day leading either way there's a world you know there's a way to go i soon believe it's just as well this is my opening farewell a child's drawings left there on the table and a woman's silk is lying on the floor i would keep them here if i were able to lock you safe behind it's open door suddenly it's so clear to me that i'd ask you to see what you may never see now my kind words find their way back to me there's a train every day leading either way there's world you know got a way to go i soon believe it's just as well this is my opening farewell this is my opening farewell
