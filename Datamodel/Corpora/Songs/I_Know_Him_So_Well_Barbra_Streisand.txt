nothing is so good it lasts eternally perfect situations must go wrong but this has never yet prevented me wanting far too much for far too long looking back i could have played it differently one of few more moments who can tell but it took time to understand the man now at least i know i know him well wasn't it good oh so good wasn't he fine oh so fine isn't it madness he can't be mine but in the end he needs a little bit more than me more she needs security he needs his fantasy and freedom i know him so well no one in your life is with you constantly no one is completely on your side and though i move my world to be with him still the gap between us is too wide looking back i could have played it differently could have played things some other way learn about the man before i fell i was just a little careless but i was ever so much younger then i was so much younger then now at least i know i know him well wasn't it good oh so good wasn't he fine oh so fine isn't it madness he won't be mine didn't i know how it would go if i knew from the start why am i falling apart wasn't he fine isn't it madness he won't be mine but in the end he needs a little bit more than me more she needs security he needs his fantasy and freedom i know him so well it took time to understand me i know him so well
