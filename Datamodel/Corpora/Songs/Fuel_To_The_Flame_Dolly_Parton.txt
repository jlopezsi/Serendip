you kindle the fire of love inside me each time our lips meet i'm not strong when we're alone your kisses make me weak you must know how i feel but do you feel the same everytime you kiss me you add fuel to the flame my eyes light up when i see you i burn with desire each time you're near you say you'll care but still i'm not sure but please don't ask me to love you if you're not gonna change my name everytime you touch me you add fuel to the flame this fire you started inside me has reached my very soul you're adding fuel to a flame that's already burning out of control when you give me your name i give you everything everytime you kiss me adds fuel to the flame yes everytime you touch me you add fuel to the flame
