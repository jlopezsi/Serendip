oh sometimes i go walking through fields where we walked long ago in the sweet used to be and the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet as they did when you picked them for me chorus and when i think of you and the love we once knew how i wish we could go back in time do you ever think back on old memories like that or do i ever cross your mind do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me do you darling oh and do your memories ever take you back into another place in time and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were with me tell me darling or do i ever cross your mind oh how often i wish that again i could kiss your sweet lips like i did long ago and how often i long for those two loving arms that once held me so gentle and close repeat chorus
