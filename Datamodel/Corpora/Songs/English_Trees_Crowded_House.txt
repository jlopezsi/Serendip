english trees in my garden we planted seeds in a faraway land in between the palms and the succulent grove they lose their leaves in the winter mark the seasons for him and for her once upon a time in the fallen snow up against the sky made a silhouette show england cries and she plays for him the chords entwined like a requiem although it's springtime and color is new in regent's park i will mourn for you and i must be wise somehow cause my heart's been broken down it's so far to fall and so hard to climb nothing's sadder i know than the passing of time won't forget me you won't forget me english trees in my garden summer's missed you my darling yet all your crimes are forgiven yet all your crimes are forgiven and i must be wise somehow and england cries oh there's english trees in my garden
