what i'll give you since you've asked is all my time together take the rugged sunny days the warm and rocky weather take the roads that i have walked looking for tomorrow's time peace of mind as your life spills into mine changing with the seasons filling up the world with time change time to reasons i can show you all the songs that i never sang to someone before we have seen a million stars lying by the water you have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter taking off the days one by one setting them to breath in the sun take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood all the willow winding paths leading up and outward this is what i give this is what i ask you for nothing more
