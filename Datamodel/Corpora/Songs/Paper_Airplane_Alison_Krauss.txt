i've put it all behind me nothin left to do or doubt some may say but every silver linin always seems to have a cloud that comes my way anticipated pleasure or unexpected pain no choice i feel love is hard to measure hidden in the rain that's why you'll find me here all alone and still wonderin why waitin inside for the cold to get colder and here where it's clear that i've wasted my time hopin to fly cause it's almost over now people come together people go their own way love conquers few and i'll do whatever i'll say what i need to say just not for you how many days should i smile with a frown cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders and how many nights must i wake up alone and know in my soul that it's almost over now love is like a paper airplane flyin in the folded dent ridin high dippin low but innocence is fair game i'm hopin i can hold it in our love will die i know
