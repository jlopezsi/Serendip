come let's talk just you and me for once just let me be the little boy you used to know relive that summer's bliss cause they came no more like this those were the days the days when love was still in style chorus all i ever dreamed i'd be is what you are to me bigger than elvis and for all the missing years a memory reappears bigger than elvis i saw you on tv the king you were to me could you feel me watching you at times my heart got mad only heroes are allowed to run free that they could come back inside of me chorus we know the sadness of goodbyes must be the one that's bringing tears to your child's eyes oh from now on i'll walk with you making music like you do would you believe i always knew you were never hard to take in some mysterious way bigger than elvis and for all the missing years your memory reappears bigger than elvis now i've found the missing years forgotten all my tears i've found the missing years
