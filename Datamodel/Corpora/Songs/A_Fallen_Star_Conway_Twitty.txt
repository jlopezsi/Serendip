a star fell from heaven right into my arms the brightest star i know i've never seen then i found out that it was only you and all your charms you came into my life to fill a dream a fallen star that's what you are the twinkle in your eye came from the sky you must have sailed from the milky way a fallen star that's what you are the heavens must be lonely now that you are mine i'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you but the stars will send their blessings and brighter they will shine for when they see the dream that's coming true a fallen star that's what you are that twinkle that's in your eye came from the sky you must have sailed from the milky way a fallen star that's what you are a fallen star
