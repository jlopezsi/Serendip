and when she drowns within and in the fizzy gin begins to sigh good god oh my i cry and die and lie beside she is the apple in my eye she talked to god i couldn't cope or'd hope eloped a dope she roped this salty lie and when she's dreaming i believe and when she's reading i retreat can't believe her telling me she's dead again telling me she's dead against it and deep my wound within for every second chance it was thy tore from deep within despite the rain my words are worn she loves to talk into the phone no matter who no matter when no matter where no better than the faulty line and when she's dreaming i believe and when she's reading i retreat can't believe her telling me she's dead again telling me she's dead against it
