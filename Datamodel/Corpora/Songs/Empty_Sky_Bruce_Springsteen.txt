i woke up this morning i could barely breathe just an empty impression in the bed there you used to be i want a kiss from your lips i want an eye for an eye i woke up this morning to an empty sky empty sky empty sky i woke up this morning to an empty sky empty sky empty sky i woke up this morning to an empty sky blood on the streets blood flowin down i hear the blood of my blood cryin from the ground empty sky empty sky i woke up this morning to an empty sky empty sky empty sky i woke up this morning to an empty sky on the plains of jordan i cut my bow from the wood of this tree of evil of this tree of good i want a kiss from your lips i want an eye for an eye i woke up this morning to the empty sky
