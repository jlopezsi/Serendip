at the edge of the moon there's a lonely man and he blows on his horn as strong as he can and the girl at the bar wipes the breath of winter away with a smile of her face and a little black dog barks along with a loon is this my appointment or did i come too soon got a strange invitation for tea time twas given by somebody i can't recall it's the middle of the riddle it's not very serious it's nothing but a big surprise and the president's horse is a rabbit of course that is living in a big boy's mind living in a big boy's mind and i skate on a knife on a wire that is strung from this song to a distant shore and then i say intuition is just another phase of chance while we're crawling through the old pyramid's floors little pharaohs and the little black dog here it comes again it's a true companion in a foreign land on a quest for the valley of boojums and birthdays and phonecalls i cannot recall all of man shan't talk to the one at the helm and the man at the helm shall talk to no one shall talk to no one at all rule 42 and a horse is a rabbit of course yes indeed yes a horse is a rabbit of course
