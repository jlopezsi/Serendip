when i was waiting for your phone call the one that never came like a man about to burst i was dying of thirst though i will never fade or get lost in this daze though i will disappear into the street parade it's not too hard to cry in these crying times i'll take a broken heart and take it home in parts but i will never fade i was in this place by the first church of the city i saw tears on the face the face of a visionary though i will disappear to join the street parade disappear and fade into the street parade
