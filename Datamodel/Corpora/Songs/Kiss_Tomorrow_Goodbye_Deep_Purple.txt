i threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom the waves spread out but the rock got forgotten the ripples came back just as we feared looking for the rock but the hole disappeared it's somewhere in the middle some ways down the last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned he ran out of time he can kiss tomorrow goodbye yes i piss in the water and burn down the trees i watch as the creatures fall to their knees they ain't got a clue as disaster looms they're too busy choking on toxic fumes they got no hope and there's no point running no matter what they do i keep on coming they ran out of time they can kiss tomorrow goodbye i did a bad thing i did a bad thing i did a bad thing i did a bad thing well hallelujah and holy mackerel all we got left is a thief and a jackal the writing is big and it's there on the wall oh how the mighty empires fall there's nothing to fix it's much too late sit down and prepare to meet your fate you have ran out of time kiss tomorrow goodbye
