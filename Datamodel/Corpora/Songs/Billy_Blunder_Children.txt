one rainy morning without any warning a large umbrella crossed the street big black and shiny covering someone tiny and all that we could see were two small feet in and out the traffic dodging here and there that umbrella went with a don't-care air i said in wonder who is that down under hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear horns started blaring everyone was staring at that strange object in the street big black and shiny covering someone tiny and all that we could see were two small feet then a young policeman called out from his beat that umbrella there has a boy down deep he swooped down under pulled out billy blunder just a tiny truant from his morning's sleep now billy blunder who was once down under recites by heart his safety code when you are out in rain or hail or thunder hold up your umbrella when you cross the road
