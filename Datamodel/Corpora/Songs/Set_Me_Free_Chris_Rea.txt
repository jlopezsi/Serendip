wake up see the morning light this is you this is today you try so hard to get it right can't help thinking somewhere you lost your way when was the last time you saw a smile there's a scream on every silent face you see they're singing set me free i got a friend who burns like a fire says there's only one thing you'll ever know it's out there somewhere way out on the open road and me i'm always looking down down that road out of town each morning and night you can see me i'm singing set me free set me free goodnight auberge i leave you now you must sleep while i work the day till i return to dream of you through the night and that free freeway
