on the front page of the paper speeding window of a train on a billboard on a highway it always looks the same a smile out of nowhere stops me in my tracks can't believe that after all this time you still have that kind of impact everywhere i turn i see your face proving that a fool's love never fades in my mind your image is forever burned i keep trying not to stare but your always there everywhere i turn in a steamed up cafe window i spell out your name i watch people run across the street through the pouring rain there you are again so easy to find under the umbrella in another woman's eyes well i thought i'd suffered long enough for you babe and my mind would let go of the pain any day but it don't work that way
