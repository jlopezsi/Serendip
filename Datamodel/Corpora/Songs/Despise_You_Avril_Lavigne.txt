please go away leave me alone to you i have nothing to say my voice has no tone i'd rather be there because you're here whatever i don't care because of you there was a tear no one cares about me no one needs me but don't you see i do whatever you do to me do you hate me cause i know i hate you that's why i want you to stay away from me you weren't the only one that i knew don't try to touch my feelings don't try to see what's on my mind cause the last thing i'd do is let you back in my life i despise you
