verse 1 grains of sand slip through your hands never seasing time fold your hands in silent prayer eternal peace you'll find chorus like two rivers flow to the open sea someday we'll reunite for all eternity verse 2 let the rain falling on your face run into your eyes can you see the rainbow now through the stormy skies chorus x2 like two rivers flow to the open sea someday we'll reunite for all eternity verse 3 standing in the rising tide heaven's light shines on you on you on you test the sea rising at your feet how far can you go till you need god's helping hand to ride the undertoe chorus x3 like two rivers flow to the open sea someday we'll reunite for all eternity
