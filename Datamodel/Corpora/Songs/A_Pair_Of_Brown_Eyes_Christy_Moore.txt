one summer evening drunk as hell i sat there nearly lifeless an old man in the corner sang where the water lilies grow on the jukebox johnny sang about a thing called love and it's how are you kid what's your name and what do you know in blood and death neath a screaming sky i lay down on the ground the arms and legs of other men were scattered all around some prayed and cursed then cursed and prayed and then they prayed some more and the only thing that i could see was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me when we got back labeled parts one to three there was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me and a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go and a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go for a pair of brown eyes for a pair of brown eyes i looked at him he looked at me all i could do was hate him while ray and philomena sang of my elusive dream i saw the streams and the rolling hills where his brown eyes were waiting and i thought about a pair of brown eyes that waited once for me that waited once for me so drunk as hell i left the place sometimes walking sometimes crawling a hungry sound came through the breeze so i gave the walls a talking and i heard the sounds of long ago from the old canal and the birds were whistling in the trees where the wind was gently laughing and a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go and a rovin a rovin a rovin i'll go for a pair of brown eyes for a pair of brown eyes
