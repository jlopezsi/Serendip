watchin a stretch of road miles of light explode driftin off a thing i'd never done before watchin the crowd roll in out go the lights it begins a feelin in my bones i never felt before people always told me that bars are dark and lonely and talk is often cheap and filled with air sure sometimes they thrill me but nothin could ever chill me like the way they make the time just disappear feelin you here again hot on my skin again feelin good a thing i'd never known before what does it mean to feel millions of dreams come real a feelin in my soul i'd never felt before and you you always told me no matter how long it holds me if it falls apart or makes us millionaires you'll be right here forever we'll go through this thing together and on heaven's golden shore we'll lay our heads
