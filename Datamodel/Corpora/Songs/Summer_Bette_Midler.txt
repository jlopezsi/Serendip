twas a hot afternoon the last day of june and the sun was a demon the clouds were afraid 110 in the shade and the pavements were steaming i told billy ray in his red chevrolet i needed time for some thinking i was just walkin by when i looked in her eye and i swore it was winkin she was thirty-one and i was seventeen i knew nothin bout love she knew everything but i sat down beside her on a front porch swing and wondered what the coming night would bring the sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky and it started to swelter sweat trickled down the front of her gown and i thought it would melt her she threw back her hair like i wasn't there and she sipped on a julep her shoulders were bare and i tried not to stare when i looked at her two lips and then she looked at me i heard her softly say i know you're young you don't know what to do or say but stay with me until the sun has gone away and i will chase the boy in you away and then she smiled and we talked for a while then we walked for a mile to the sea we sat on the sand and a boy took her hand but i saw the sunrise as a man ten years have gone by since i looked in her eye but the memory lingers i go back in my mind to the very first time and feel the touch of her fingers
