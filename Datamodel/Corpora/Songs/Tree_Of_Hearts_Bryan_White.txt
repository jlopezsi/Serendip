on a tree inside a heart a dull boyscout knife took half a day to carve michael loves caroline he just turned ten and she was nine the summer she turned sweet sixteen he finally found his nerve and took her out to see and what she saw through her tears were seven hearts for seven years chorus and they stood beneath the tree of hearts and they watch their feelings grow and they swore they'd never be apart true love left it's mark on the tree of hearts the tenth time he carved their names caroline's dad was giving her away there beneath the shelter of the tree of hearts they pledged their love and then four hearts down the road they brought the first of two born home chorus and they played beneath the tree of hearts and they watched their children grow and they swore they'd never be apart true love left it's mark on the tree of hearts bridge in the blinking of an eye somehow fifty-seven hears flew by fifty-eight fifty-nine sixty he missed caroline at sixty-one michael knew there wouldn't be a sixty-two chorus now they lay beneath the tree of hearts an you can watch their love still grow where they swore they'd never be apart true love left it's mark on the tree of hearts
