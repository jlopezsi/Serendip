all summer long we were happy we were one we didn't think of an ending to our play all summer long nights of wine days of song it couldn't last our aging sun had to go i will always remember you watching the waves in the wind the beach dogs hiding from the rain suddenly my colors have turned to grey will i ever see your face again and all winter long i will walk my lonely road waiting for you and your return i will always remember you
