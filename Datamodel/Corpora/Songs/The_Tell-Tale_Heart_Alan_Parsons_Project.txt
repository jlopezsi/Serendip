you should have seen him lying alone in helpless silence in the night you should have seen him you would have seen his eye reflecting in the light so for the old man ashes to ashes earth to earth and dust to dust no one will see me no one with guilt to share no secret soul to trust louder and louder till i could tell the sound was not within my ears you should have seen me you would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear heard all the things in heaven and earth i've seen many things in hell but his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue is the eye of the devil himself take me away now but let the silence drown the beating of his heart
