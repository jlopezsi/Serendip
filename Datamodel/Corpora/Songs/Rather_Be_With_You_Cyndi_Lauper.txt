sometimes i look at you feel like i make you blue wish i could make us all brand new wish i had some mystery left to my personality then i could wink at you and you'd laugh like you used to you know i think we'll make it through cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you we could move on if you wanted to cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you i know it's hard not to continue what we do and remove a pattern like an old tattoo i go with you you go with me but if we had some clarity well maybe we could stop ourselves before we both get silly you know i think we'll make it through cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you we could move on if you wanted to cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you always felt strong we belong from the first time you stood next to me am i still your girl cause in a crowded world you are still the only man i see maybe we'd stop ourselves before we both get silly you know i think we'll make it through cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you we could move on if you wanted to cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you you know i think we'll make it through cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you we could move on if you wanted to cause if it's all the same i'd rather be with you
