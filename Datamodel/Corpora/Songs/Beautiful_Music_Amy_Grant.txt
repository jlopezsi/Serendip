once my life had no direction i was lost as could be i was caught in a whirlpool spinning around in misery i needed a friend you took me in and you touched my heart with your song of love you gave me a brand new start now there's beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said angels singin joy bells ringing inside my head since you came inside me now i'm lost inside your love you gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you now i'm hooked on your lovin and i don't want to break loose with my heart in my hand i'm yours to command do what you want me to just never let me go lord i'm so in love with you now there's beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head since you came inside me now i'm lost inside your love beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head beautiful music flowin on through me just like you said angels singin joy bells ringin inside my head
