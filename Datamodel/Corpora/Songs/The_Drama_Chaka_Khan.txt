in this ever-changing world where things become unfurled and tethered like a lioness in her pride i was gonna stay by your side forever as a planet keeps her moon your love i had assumed and taken and if this love can't come to pass then i would be alas forsaken chorus the drama of the chase the look upon your face make up your mind it would be a waste if you didn't love me it would be the drama of all time if i'm not good enough for you what else could i do i could change you know they say like wine you get better with passin time how strange i wish that in your eyes you saw me like the others see me i could never say enough darlin just how much i wish you'd keep me chorus drama drama of all time it's been ten long years since i fell in love so dear it's got to be the drama of all time called you on the telephone and wondered if you were alone it's got to be the drama of all time when i called you back it was busy what was that it's a drama drama of all time who were you with last night busy busy you must be busier than a one-legged man in a kick fight got to be the drama of all time drama drama of all time
