if you think candy's sweet there's a girl you ought to meet sugar drips from her lips when she sighs but the love light that lies within my baby's eyes how it lies how it lies how it lies she has style she has charms and a pair of loving arms that i'm dying to try on for size but the love light that lies within my baby's eyes how it lies how it lies how it lies oh her name tops the list of every florist her beaus stand ten deep in line with all of the trees in the forest why should i be the only clinging vine oh there's heartbreak in store where the one that you adore is a devil in the angel disguise but the love light that lies is the love light that dies how it lies how it lies how it lies
