if you think you're alone that you're the only one who is afraid let me tell you i feel just like you do and sometimes i stand back from desires and dreams i don't understand they overwhelm me i feel just like you do chorus i feel just like you do i feel just like you do just like you do just like you do i feel just like you do just like you do i feel just like you do and when it comes to love you want me to be the one to say the words i love you but i feel just like you do but let's try to return to that brave innocence we once knew i wish you were an ocean so i could jump into you chorus
