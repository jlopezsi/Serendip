gonna walk down that dirt road til someone will let me ride gonna walk down that dirt road til someone will let me ride if i can't find my baby i'm gonna run away and hide well i been pacing round the room hoping maybe she come back pacing round the room hoping maybe she come back well i been praying for salvation laying round in a one-room country shack gonna walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed gonna walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed til there's nothing left to see til the chains have been shattered and i been freed but i'm looking at my shadow i been watching the clouds up above looking at my shadow watching the clouds up above rolling through the rain and hail looking for the sunny side of love gonna walk down that dirt road til everything becomes the same gonna walk down that dirt road til everything becomes the same i keep on walking til i hear her holler out my name
