one last kiss one only then i'll let you go hard for you i've fallen but you can't break my fall i'm broken don't break me when i hit the ground some devil some angel has got me to the bones you said always and forever now i believe you baby you said always and forever is such a long and lonely time too drunk and still drinking it's just the way i feel it's alright is what you told me cause what we had was so beautiful feel heavy like floating at the bottom of the sea you said always and forever now i believe you baby you said always and forever is such a long and lonely time some devil is stuck inside of me why can't i set it free i wish i wish i was dead and you were breathing just so that you could know some angel is stuck inside of me but can i set you free you said always and forever now i believe you baby you said always and forever such a long and lonely time stuck inside of me
