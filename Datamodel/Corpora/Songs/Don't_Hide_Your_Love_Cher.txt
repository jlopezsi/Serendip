you never give yourself completely it's just that you've been hurt before you're so afraid to let me love you you never leave an open door don't judge me by some other lover who broke your heart and walked away come let's be fair with one another my world is yours i swear it say the word and we can share it chorus don't hide your love don't hide your love not if you care for me not if you care for me it isn't fair for me to worry and wonder and wait don't hide your love don't hide your love just love me here and now just love me here and now we'll work it out somehow don't you keep us apart baby unlock your heart don't hide your love well i now the past has bought you sorrow the clouds still hang around today but don't let the rain fall on tomorrow baby we can make it together cause i'm gonna love you forever chorus
