even though i'm in love sometimes i get so afraid i'll say something so wrong just to have something to say i know the moment isn't right to tell the girl a comical line to keep the conversation light i guess i'm just frightened out of my mind but if that's how i feel then it's the best feeling i've even known it's undeniably real leave a tender moment alone yes i know i'm in love but just when i ought to relax i put my foot in my mouth cause i'm just avoiding the facts if the girl gets too close if i need some room to escape when the moment arose i'd tell her it's all a mistake but that's not how i feel no that's not the woman i've known she's undeniably real so leave a tender moment alone but it's not only me breaking down when the tension gets high just when i'm in a serious mood she is suddenly quiet and shy leave a tender moment leave it alone i know the moment isn't right to hold my emotions inside to change the attitude tonight i've run out of places to hide and if that's how i feel then it's the best feeling i've even known it's undeniably real leave a tender moment alone you got to leave a tender moment alone leave a tender moment leave it alone you've got to leave a tender moment leave a tender moment alone
