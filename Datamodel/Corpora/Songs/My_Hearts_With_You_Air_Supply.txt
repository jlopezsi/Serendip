i know you're leaving i won't ask you to stay i won't hold you back i won't stand in your way if that's what you've gotta do i understand it's not that easy setting you free but that's how it's gotta be and as you're walking away as i'm watching you go there's one thing i want you to know just remember my heart's with you when the night gets so long and cold and no ones there to hold and you're all alone take a moment to think of me and the love that we used to know and if you ever find you ever need me someday i'm just a heartbeat away saying goodbye isn't saying were through just know through it all i'm still here for you light a light in the window when your lost in the dark ooh these arms would be happy to hold you again if ever you miss me or when you start thinking about all the nights that we shared darling you know ill be there just remember my heart's with you when the night gets so long and cold and no ones there to hold and you're all alone take a moment to think of me and the love that we used to know and if you ever find you ever need me someday you walk to the door with nothing to say i look in your eyes and you look away you're leaving me now but darling i hope hope that you'll look back someday and remember my hearts with you when the night gets so long and cold and no one's there to hold when you're all alone baby take a moment to think of me and the love that we used to know and if you ever find that you're all alone just remember my heart's with you when the night gets so long and cold and no ones there to hold and you're all alone take a moment to think of me and the love that we used to know and if you ever find that you're all alone
