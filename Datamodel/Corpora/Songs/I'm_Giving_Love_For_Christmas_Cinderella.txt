i'm giving love for christmas to everyone i know it doesn't need a bow it only needs to come from your heart i'm giving love for christmas so everyone can see what christmas means to me it's more than presents under the tree christmas is all about caring and as every princess knows nothing is quiet as warming when it's storming or it snows so i'm giving love for christmas the best gift that i can give and in these times we live it seems more and more what we're looking for christmas is being with family seeing all the friends you've missed making new christmas memories that's the first thing on my christmas list i'd give you everything if i had everything it's true but all that i have is my heart to give so that's what i'm giving you i'm giving love for christmas and hoping that you will too i will i will and hoping that if you do it just might be me you give your love to and that would be my best christmas dream come true
