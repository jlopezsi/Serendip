i like the way sparkling earrings lay upon your skin so brown and i want to sleep with you in the desert night with a million stars all around i get a peaceful easy feelin and i know you won't let me down cause i'm already standin on the ground and i found out a long time ago what a woman can do to your soul aw but she can't take you any way you don't already know how to go i get a peaceful easy feelin and i know you won't let me down cause i'm already standin on the ground i get this feelin i may know you as a lover and a friend this voice keeps whisperin in my other ear tells me i may never see you again i get a peaceful easy feelin and i know you won't let me down cause i'm already standin yes i'm already standin yes i'm already standin on the ground
