hush little baby don't say a word mama's going to buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird don't sing mama's going to buy you a diamond ring and if that diamond ring turns brass mama's going to buy you a looking glass and if that looking glass gets broke mama's going to buy you a billy goat and if that billy goat won't pull mama's going to buy you a cart and bull and if that cart and bull turn over mama's going to buy you a dog named rover and if that dog named rover won't bark mama's going to buy you a horse and cart and if that horse and cart fall down you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town
