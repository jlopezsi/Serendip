there's a chill on this evening nights right for greaving darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone he walked past the dim lights the pathways and street lights they remind him of nights long ago when his love was strong and his muscles hard his whiskey throat was barley marred seeking misfortune in the lies that he told then a brokin heart bought him to his knees in the hour of his greatest need lost and forsaken by the love he could not hold chorus on the border line of love again its bound to make you pay on the border line we'll make our stand then watch it fall away and he stands in quiet solitude the nights reflects upon his mood seeking the vision that had once been so clear when he felt the touch of his women's love his pounding heart was warm and young now locked inside him with his anger and fear as he moves on slowly past the trees down the path way home through fallen leaves he can't believe how he'd sunken so low so he learned to live with his injured pride his purple heart hidden deep inside the only reward for a love he could not hold chorus 2x
