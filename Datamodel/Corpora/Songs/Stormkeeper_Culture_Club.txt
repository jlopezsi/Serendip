ooh i have love sweeter than lies gave you no reason not to decide say you are leaving you've got too much pride it's not love if you have it to hide it oh woe who is the man who puts waves on the sand it's the stormkeeper stormkeeper liven my life when i need to survive is the storm keeping you warm keeping you warm oh i have cried so many times but only for things that never were mine heaven is sweet love is unkind thoughts are twisted inside of your mind don't let them tell you that this love is wrong and don't let them fool you that this love can't go on
