because you're mine the brightest star i see looks down my love and envies me because you're mine because you're mine because you're mine the breeze that hurries by becomes a melody and why because you're mine because you're mine i only know for as long as i may live i'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me and when we kiss that isn't thunder dear it's only my poor heart you hear and it's applause because you're mine and when we kiss that isn't thunder dear it's only my poor heart you hear and it's applause because you're mine
