i said that i felt jailed up as if our doors were nailed up i said i needed separate places parties room to move around in i said i needed my fling had to get out and do some other thing it took me months to calculate that i had nothing left without you chorus dan my fling is all flung out now i've got to fall back on dreams i thought i'd try and write you i thought i'd try and phone you i thought i'd try to tell you that i smell your hair still on my pillow but you'd just mile to please me you'd shake your head you'd tease me remind me it was i who first claimed that we both required freedom chorus i'd dream up schemes to meet you i'd nonchalantly greet you i'd ask you up for coffee anytime you had an hour open you say you like my hair long you ask me if i've written any new songs you'd laugh you'd turn and cross the street and leave me dizzy with your laughter chorus i hear you're leaving this town you and some girl gonna travel around you bought a car with foldback seats you'll camp out by the lakes and forests i lie alone in our old bed your laughter it's echoin inside my head i close my eyes i smell your hair it's like i haven't slept in years chorus
