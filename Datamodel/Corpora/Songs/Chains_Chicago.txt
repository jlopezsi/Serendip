i don't want any trouble i don't want to make any waves i don't want any conscience and i don't wanna be brave i've kept my distance my feelings have never been shown i know that i've been walking fences denied what i have known and i carry chains i carry chains heavy heavy chains chains that are made i carry chains round my feet i carry chains i feel the weight i feel the weight chains are the different things that should not be hanging on me i put my conscience under a stone the stone under the ground walked from where i had left it i hoped it couldn't be found my conscience persisted it's a haunted seed i have sown calls me out from the distance and it just won't leave me alone and i carry chains i carry chains chains that are made chains that are made i carry heavy chains i carry chains talk about the weight i feel the weight i carry chains i carry chains you know i feel the weight chains that are made i feel i feel i carry chains you no i feel the weight i feel the weight chains are the temporary things that should not be hanging on me i carry chains chains that are made i carry heavy chains i feel the weight i carry chains chains that are made i carry chains i feel the weight i carry chains chains that are made i carry chains i feel the weight
