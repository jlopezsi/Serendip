when the day is done and there's nowhere to run and the people of the city have all lost and won in your city dress you stand and stare and you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair and the light that shines paints a trace of sadness on the street i wait but i can't seem to get to you well you start to sway check your cartier cause it's getting late you can't afford to wait so you move along where it's going on and the people of the night are playing til the dawn and the sun that shines paints a trace of sadness in your eyes that cry wishing and hoping oh chorus sweet sweet is the night now you are near dark dark were the days they disappear sweet sweet is the night now you are near well you did your thing and you lost your wings and you hurt so bad you lost everything and the tears that fall on the city wall will fade away with the rays of morning light that shines paints a smile across your pretty face i know everything is alright alright chorus
