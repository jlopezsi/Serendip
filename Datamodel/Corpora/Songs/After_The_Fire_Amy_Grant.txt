after the fire is over after the ashes cool after the smoke is blown away i will be is for you after the stillness finds you after the winds of change all that is good and true between us this will remain the same slowly slowly we turn the pages of life growing knowing it comes at quite a price after the fire is over after the ashes cool after the smoke is blown away i will be here for you after your time of wondering along this lonely road there will be many voices calling mine will say welcome home slowly slowly we turn the pages of life growing knowing it comes at quite a price after the fire is over after the ash is cool after the smoke is blown away i will be here for you i will be here for you
