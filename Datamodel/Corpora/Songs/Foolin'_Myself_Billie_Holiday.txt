i try to keep you out of my heart but somehow i find trying to keep you out of my heart i'm out of my mind i tell myself i'm through with you and i'll having nothing more to do with you i stay away but every day i'm just foolin myself tell my friends that i don't care i shrug my shoulders at the whole affair but all know it isn't so i'm just foolin myself and every time i pass and see my face in a looking glass i tip my hat and say how do you do you fool you're trowing your life away i'm acting gay i'm acting proud and every time i see you in a crowd i may pretend but in the end i'm just fooling myself
