when you sing of the joy only love can bring heaven knows it's in my heart and my soul we're caught in a world full of tears so many bad times and fears so while there's a chance and you're near let's dance let's dance there's a world far away from the one we see there's a dream i will never let go one thing is certainly true this moment's for me and for you so while there's not a thing that we can do well let's dance let's dance
