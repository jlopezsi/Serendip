you know our love is driftin we have fallen from its grace we've got to face the situation put things in their place you're still the man you know just where you stand but the way you felt for me is gone there's no more truth to your song chorus but i've got so much love for you it's too much love so much love for you it's too much love so much love for you it's too much love and i just don't want to throw it away i've got to sacrifice my feelings to make you find your own i think it's time to end it you might be better off alone oh you're still the man you know just where you stand but the way you felt for me is gone there's no more truth to your song there's something you've got to know when it's over it's over if it's done then baby it's done but there's nowhere to go if we leave it all behind too much love too much love too much love
