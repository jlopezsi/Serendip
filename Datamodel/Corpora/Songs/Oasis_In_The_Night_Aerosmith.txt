these days are slipping away like thieves in the night i try to hold on to them with all my might precious time spent with you goes by much too fast like snow in the sun it just never seems to last another tasteless coffee another empty day suddenly last night is just so far away too many talking heads what was it that they said when we're apart the days are dark when i'm with you i'm in the light you're my oasis in the night yeah you're my oasis in the night you're my oasis in the night you keep our love light shinning bright you're my oasis in the night yeah when you're in my arms you keep the world at bay you stop it at the door i don't care what they say time's too short the fire's too hot don't know what to do cause i know in a flash it's just a memory too another tasteless coffee another empty day suddenly last night is just so far away too many talking heads what was it that they said when we're apart my days are dark when i'm with you i'm in the light you're my oasis in the night you're my oasis in the night you're my oasis in the night you're my oasis in the night i think i'll die i just can't wait till our next oasis in the night yeah aah till our next oasis in the night till our next oasis in the night yeah you're my oasis in the night
