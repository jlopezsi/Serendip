got a little rhythm a rhythm a rhythm that pit-a-pats through my brain so darn persistent the day isn't distant when it'll drive me insane comes in the morning without any warning and hangs around me all day i'll have to sneak up to it someday and speak up to it i hope it listens when i say fascinating rhythm you've got me on the go fascinating rhythm i'm all a-quiver when a mess you're making the neighbors want to know why i'm always shaking just like a flivver each morning i get up with the sun start a-hopping never stopping to find at night no work has been done i know that once it didn't matter but now you're doing wrong when you start to patter i'm so unhappy won't you take a day off decide to run along somewhere far away off and make it snappy oh how i long to be the man i used to be fascinating rhythm on won't you stop picking on me
