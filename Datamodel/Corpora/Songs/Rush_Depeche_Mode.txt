walk with me open your sensitive mouth and talk to me hold out your delicate hands and feel me couldn't make any plans to conceal me open your sensitive mouth hold out your delicate hands with such a sensitive mouth i'm easy to see through when i come up when i rush i rush for you cry for you seen the tears roll down from my eyes for you heard my truth distorting to lies for you watched my love becoming a prize for you seen the tears in my eyes heard my truth turn to lies seen the tears in my eyes i'm not proud of what i do when i come up when i rush i rush for you i come up to meet you up there somewhere when i rush to greet you my soul is bared gave more for you dropped my crutches and crawled on the floor for you went looking behind every door for you and because of the things that i saw for you i spiritually grew when i come up when i rush i rush for you
