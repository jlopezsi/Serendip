there is an aching in my head from the bed i can't get used to it's these little hours in the dark i dread as i spend my first night alone without you honey half of me has gone away with all the love i learned to cling to tomorrow i'll have to find another way to live the rest of my life alone without you you taught me how to live how to be myself and how to give oh but now it's you who's given up on giving you've lost the thing no one to teach changing and now you're out of reach and my life tonight just don't seem worth living no no i've been sitting learning how to read cause back in school i never liked to it's just one of those little things i'm gonna need as i put my life together baby without you
