verse so wicked in the way he moves don't miss it do not be a fool it's a long way it's a long way home light inside of me it ignites my bones chorus he comes to me in my dreams and tells me what i need to know he makes me feel so at ease and guides me to a light so warm i just wanna fall into his arms tonight someone tell me i will be alright i'll hold on tight verse remembering i forever will surrendering just to how it felt it's a long way it's a long way home light inside of me it ignites my bones chorus he comes to me in my dreams and tells me what i need to know he makes me feel so at ease and guides me to a light so warm i just wanna fall into his arms tonight someone tell me i will be alright i'll hold on tight bridge and when it's over fond going gray the cinema is fading away i gotta make my way through the night passing on with all of my might and then i'm lost and i can't find the way i feel the pieces breaking away hug myself with all of my might don't look down just hold on tight chorus he comes to me in my dreams and tells me what i need to know he makes me feel so at ease and guides me to a light so warm i just wanna fall into his arms tonight someone tell me i will be alright i'll hold on tight
