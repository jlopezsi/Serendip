everyday seem like sunday it must be something that i have done i saw you dancing in the peep-show that every episode is leading me on i'm just another fool that you've got to humor can't say i love you when it's just a rumor but if none of your dreams come true you can call on me call on me cause i've seen dreams have a happy ending disappearing on my tv and you can call on me you can call on me you can call on me you can call on me when i go home i watch the television i go to sleep i dream about the television i go to work i talk about the television i used to think that love is something that it isn't sometimes i feel just like a human being that's just something between you and me but if none of you dreams come true you can call on me call on me cause i've seen dreams have a happy ending disappearing on my tv and you can call on me you can call on me you can call on me you can call on me
