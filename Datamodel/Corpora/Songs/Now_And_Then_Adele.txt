sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with words that i cry how i'm still trying to stay inside hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow from dust then our eyes cry and souls sigh so that we know that it hurts our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow from dust then our eyes cry and souls sigh so that we know that it hurts every now and then my memories ache with the empty ideas of the ones we'd made but as time goes on and my age gets older i love the ones i know they're enough to picture the rain cause heart break and hearts wait to make us grow from dust then our eyes cry and souls sigh so that we know that it hurts our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow from dust then our eyes cry and souls sigh so that we know that it hurts you know when to make me i might just your heal you know when to make me i might just your heal you know when to make me i might just your heal you know when to make me i might just your heal
