chorus a heartsong melody play like a symphony the sweetest music i have ever known a song of joy and pain the mountain angels sing a bittersweet refreign of my smokey mountain home heartsong farmer's daughter if you will and i often wonder still in memories where i rammbled as a child makes me cry and makes me laugh my reflections on the past and the family friends and faith that shaped my life ragged clothes and hand-me-downs just enough to go around but the sweetest things in life are always free like the songs the birds would sing and the sweet new grass of spring and the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree repeat chorus and i recall the thrill and joy of a smokey mountain boy i remember my first kiss and my first love and the songs i'd song and write and the dreams i'd clutch so tight and the loved ones that gave me that extra shove and in that little house a prayer where i spent many hour prassin god and liftin up his name and asking him to lead and to keep watch over me as i headed up that rocky road to fame and now this smokey mountain girl has been all around the world but it makes no difference just how far i roam i still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart my faith in god and memories of home repeat chorus
