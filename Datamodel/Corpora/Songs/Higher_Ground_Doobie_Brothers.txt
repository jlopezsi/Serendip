mornin finds me at the table sifting through your memories i'd change your mind but i'm not able cause you were gone long before i could set you free no more hearin bad notes playin songs i don't believe any more cold wind blows and the rivers rise let the muddy waters slide i think it's time to head for higher ground somethin better in the sky time to spread my wings and fly heaven help me up to higher ground midnight sends its shiny darkness throws a shadow on my dreams i don't have time time for broken hearted cause i'm all paid up on the tears you left for me no more cryin no more buyin into lies i don't believe what you say cold wind blows and the rivers rise let the muddy waters slide i think it's time to head for higher ground somethin better in the sky time to spread my wings and fly heaven help me up to higher ground cold wind blows and the rivers rise let the muddy waters slide i think it's time to head for higher ground somethin better in the sky time to spread my wings and fly heaven help me up to higher ground
