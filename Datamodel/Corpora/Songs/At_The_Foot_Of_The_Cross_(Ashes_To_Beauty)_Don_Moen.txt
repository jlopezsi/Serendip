at the foot of the cross where grace and suffering meet you have shown me your love through the judgment you received and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can trade these ashes in for beauty and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross where i am made complete you have given me life through the death you bore for me and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can trade these ashes in for beauty and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can trade these ashes in for beauty and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down i trade these ashes in for beauty and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down i lay every burden down every burden i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross
