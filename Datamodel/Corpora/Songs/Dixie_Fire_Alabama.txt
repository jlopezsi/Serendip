i'm not a stranger to passion i've seen a lot of love in my time felt that physical attraction from the touch in the heat of the night been all over the country started my share of new flames but after all is said and done there's only one that remains chorus dixie fire burning down in my soul dixie fire it never leaves me whole it took a hometown girl to show me how cruel these hot summer nights can be now there's a dixie fire burning in the heart of me burning in the heart of me searching for some kind of direction looking for a guiding light needed to see a lighthouse like a ship on a stormy night somehow you heard my music you felt the sadness in me you took the words that were so cold and added a warm melody chorus burn burn burning burn burn burning cant you see that im burn burn burning there's a dixie fire burn burn burning don't you know that im burn burn burning burn burn burning
