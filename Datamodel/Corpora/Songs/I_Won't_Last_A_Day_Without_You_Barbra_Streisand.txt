day after day i must face a world of strangers where i don't belong i'm not that strong it's nice to know that there's someone i can turn to who will always care you're always there when there's no getting over that rainbow when my smallest of dreams won't come true i can take all the madness the world has to give but i won't last a day without you so many times when the city seems to be without a friendly face a lonely place it's nice to know that you'll be there if i need you and you'll always smile it's all worthwhile when there's no getting over that rainbow when my smallest of dreams won't come true i can take all the madness the world has to give but i won't last a day without you touch me and i end up singing troubles seem to up and disappear you touch me with the love you're bringing i can't really lose when you're near when you're near and love if all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind just hard to find one look at you and i know that i could learn to live without the rest i found the best when there's no getting over that rainbow when my smallest of dreams won't come true i can take all the madness the world has to give but i won't last a day without you no i won't last a day without you can't last a day without you
