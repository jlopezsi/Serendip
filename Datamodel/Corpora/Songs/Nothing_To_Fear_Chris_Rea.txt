i feel your heat in dusty whispers the wind is cold around your moon it's getting hard to keep our distance i know your time is coming soon don't point your dream on my horizon don't take your rose too far from home please don't forget we're not each other each soul has black thorns of his own i see you dancing your song is clear you've got to show me got to show me there's nothing to fear nothing to fear i have my loved ones you have yours so let us gaze upon the feast in god's own name let's eat together in god's own name please come in peace see how our children play together while you and me we stand alone i know we'll never be each other if i leave you leave me alone i see you dancing your song is clear you've got to show me got to show me there's nothing to fear nothing to fear
