deep inside my soul fights a war i can't explain i can't cross over any more all i see are dirty faces rain and wire and common sense in pieces but i try to see through irish eyes belfast look outside summer's lost and gone it's a long walk on a street of right and wrong in every inch of sadness rock and tanks go hand in hand with madness but i never saw a braver place belfast and it's sad when they sing and hollow ears listen of smokin black roses on the streets of belfast and so say your lovers from under the flowers every foot of this world needs an inch of belfast who's to say on whom heaven smiles our different ways we try harder to recognize no more enchanted evenings the pubs are closed and all the ghosts are leaving but you'll never let them shut you down belfast and it's sad when they sing and hollow ears listen of smokin black roses on the streets of belfast and so say your lovers from under the flowers every foot of this world needs an inch of belfast the enemy is not at home a jealous green streaks down this faulty diamond no bloody boots or crucifix can ever hope to split this emerald island but i never saw a braver place belfast
