oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me i can see that far away look in your eyes i can tell by the way you hold me darling that it won't be long before it's crying time now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder and that tears are only rain to make love grow well my love for you could never grow no stronger if i lived to be a hundred years old oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me i can see that far away look in your eyes i can tell by the way you hold me darling that it won't be long before it's crying time now you say you've found someone you love better that's the way it's happened every time before and as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow crying time will start when you walk out the door oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me i can see that far away look in your eyes
