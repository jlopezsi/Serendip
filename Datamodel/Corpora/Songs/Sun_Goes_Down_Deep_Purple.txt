oh you're all looking up with hearts of devotion through the dust and the heat lost to me in a cloud of emotion i have no motivation to keep this breathless pace i'm more inclined to stay here in this breathing space and the sun goes down and the moon comes up i never tried to walk the walk cause the steps are elusive the membership is too costly and exclusive hey the more i've got the more i stand to lose so i'm gonna unpack my bags and take off my shoes and the sun goes down and the moon comes up let me tell you there's no point knocking at the big oak door can't you see that it's all full up they can't take no more the line's so long it's almost disney ooh won't somebody kiss me and the sun goes down and the moon comes up
