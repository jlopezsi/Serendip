when i'm in heat someone gets a notion i jump to my feet i hoof it to the ocean we hit a beach where no one gives a hoot nobody never ever wears a suit the ladies there they look so proud that's cause they know that they've been so well endowed now i ain't much for fannie's conversation or care to much about her operation but every time pandora comes my way i get high can't explain the sensation to get it on i gotta watch what i say or i'll catch hell from the women's liberation chorus sweet pandora good-like aura smell like a flora open up your door-a for me sweet pandora good-like aura smell like a flora open up your door-a for me sweet pandora mama crack a smile for me just for me just for me just for me just for me just for me just for me just for me now i ain't what you'd call a city slicker or claim to fame to be a slitty licker but every time pandora comes my way i get high can't explain the sensation to get it on i gotta watch what i say or i'll catch hell from the women's liberation chorus
