dolly parton you oughta go north somebody told us cause the air is filled with gold dust and fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands now i don't recall you said it but we'd lived so long on credit and so we headed out to find our promised land just poor appalachian farm folk with nothing more than high hopes we hitched our station wagon to a star but our dreams all fell in on us cause there was no land of promise and it's a stuggle keepin sight of who you are oh and these northern nights are dreary and my southern heart is weary i wonder how the old folks are back home but i'll keep leanin on sweet jesus i know he'll love and guide and lead us appalachian memories keep me strong ya know i've been thinkin a whole lot lately about what's been and what awaits me it takes all i've got to give what life demands you go insane if you give in to it life's a mill and i've been through it i'm just thankful i'm creative with my hands oh and these northern nights are dreary and my southern eyes are teary don't i wonder how the old folks are back home but i'll keep leanin on my jesus i know he'll love and guide and lead us appalachian memories keep me strong i'll keep lookin to the father keep our heads above the water appalachian memories keep me strong
