i've just reached a place where the willow don't bend there's not much more to be said it's the top of the end i'm going i'm going i'm gone i'm closin the book on the pages and the text and i don't really care what happens next i'm just going i'm going i'm gone i been hangin on threads i been playin it straight now i've just got to cut loose before it gets late so i'm going i'm going i'm gone grandma said boy go and follow your heart and you'll be fine at the end of the line all that's gold isn't meant to shine don't you and your one true love ever part i been walkin the road i been livin on the edge now i've just got to go before i get to the ledge so i'm going i'm just going i'm gone
