i see you now oh fill me now i feel it's coming down my voice cries out and i only hope that you're the one my voice will fall upon i play my cards but it's by the grace of love that i play my cards at all come fill me up oh fill me now when i'm empty when i'm all dried out rain rain rain down on me again and again rain down on me oh i see you now i see them all see them all they line up to drink the blood i see it now i believe the devil and the lord have been dancing all along rain rain rain down on me again and again rain down on me i feel it now i see you standing there like an angel that fell down from above i see you now i don't believe that anything but a billion years could make you what you are rain rain rain down on me again and again rain down on me rain rain rain down on me
