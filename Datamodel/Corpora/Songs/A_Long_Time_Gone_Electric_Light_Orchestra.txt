seems like forever and time left to spare when i look out the window and still you're not there you're a long time gone such a long time gone tearing down memories bitter and sweet smashing away til it's all obsolete you're a long time gone long time gone such a long time gone long time gone you're a long time gone do i wonder why every day that i think about you still and i always will did so much for me now i think i see this i do believe feels more like a dream looked at the weeds in the broken concrete before the bulldozers waltzed in and killed the old street you're a long time gone long time gone such a long time gone long time gone door steps that shone in a bright summer sky lay shattered and wasted since our last goodbye you're a long time gone long time gone such a long time gone long time gone you're a long time gone do i wonder why every day that i think about you still and i always will you're a long time gone did so much for me now i think i see this i do believe feels more like a dream you're a long time gone do i wonder why you're a long time gone you never did i never said goodbye you're a long time gone
