sadness has filled a lonely place before that there was just a hole at least now there's sadness on my face my lower lip has finally found it's role so the wind and the rain and the snow had no particular place to go so they thought they'd come and spend some time with me they're better friends than you could ever be there's a tattoo a small tattoo waiting there unpaid for you and if you ever bump into unlucky don't forget who broke your heart in two you better get there early there's a million in the queue just waiting for the name on their tattoo emptiness has filled a vacant heart finally found a place for it to hide and as i wander like a fool from bar to bar empty has become my greatest guide and the tears and the pain and the despise looked at me through bankrupt eyes they had nowhere else that they could land so i invited them to take my bloody hand so queuing for a tattoo and i can't decide the name i've been wondering night after night when they put that needle in me i'll scream your name in pain and i hope he spells you bastard right b-a-s-t-a-r-d stick that needle deep in me
