into the night still falls the rain even the dogs stay home tonight out on the streets going nowhere just one direction in my thoughts love can be magic it can be a game sometimes it's tragic and sometimes a shame words were my bullets emotion my gun i was a runner now i'm on the run sometimes i wish that you were dead that is because you haunt me so i wasn't right to let you go away i try to kill the pain inside but you are always on my mind no matter where i go or stay sometimes i dream my time away and we're together again but i know that can never be and all my hopes are in vain you were my treasure that i didn't know you were the sun in my life thought i was dying when i realized there's just one chance to survive
