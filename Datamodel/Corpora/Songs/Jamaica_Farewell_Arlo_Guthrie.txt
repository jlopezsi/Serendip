down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain top i took a trip on a sailing ship and when i reached jamaica i made a stop chorus but i'm sad to say i'm on my way won't be back for many a day my heart is down my head is turning around i had to leave a little girl in kingston town sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancing girls swaying to and fro i must declare that my heart is there though i've been from maine to mexico chorus down at the market you can hear ladies cry out while on their head they bear ackie rice and salt fish is nice and the rum is good any time of year chorus chorus
