i wanna run away don't come out looking round too busy dealing with it on my own he's right behind me please god i can't be found don't cast another stone feel out the night until the sunrise the city tells me not to go til dawn and if he wakes that's when my heart breaks and i'm as good as gone how do i lie awake now when i know i've got to be moving on how do i lie awake now when nothing's right and nothing's wrong and in the end will we make our amends just like we're face to face another dawn and in the light or when the moon shines will you take me on home how do i lie awake now when i know i've got to be moving on how do i lie awake now when nothing's right and nothing's wrong how do i lie awake now when nothing's right and nothing's wrong how do i lie awake now when i know i've got to be moving on how do i lie awake now when nothing's right and nothing's wrong
