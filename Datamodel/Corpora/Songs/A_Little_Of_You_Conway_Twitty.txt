today i put on your favorite shirt i know you won't see me but what can it hurt it's just a piece of your memory that stayed behind it hangs in my closet and here in my mind oh oh in everything that i do there will always be a little of you in my soul emblazoned and blue there will always be a little of you in every smile i have to force on my face in every tear that i ever taste in every victory that i like to share in every loss when i wish you were there beside me oh oh in everything that i do there will always be a little of you in my soul emblazoned and blue there will always be a little of you i'm all over the pain but the scars remain to remind me oh oh in everything that i do there will always be a little of you in my soul emblazoned and blue there will always be a little of you oh oh there's a little of you
