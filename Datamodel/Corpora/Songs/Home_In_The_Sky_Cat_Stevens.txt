come the morning i'll be far from here slowly rising in another sphere old world goodbye cause i'll be home in the sky in the morning bye bye stars are crying over my old house but i'm still breathing happy above the clouds home home at last because all of the bad times are past music is a lady that i still love cause she gives me the air that i breathe music is a lady that i still need cause she brings me the food that i eat come the morning i'll be far from here slowly rising in another sphere home world goodbye cause ill be home in the sky in the morning bye bye
