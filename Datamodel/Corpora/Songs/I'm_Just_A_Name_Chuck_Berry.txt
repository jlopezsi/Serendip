hello i'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone someone you won't remember of the many that you own i'm just a name within your past you met while all alone someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown i know i'm only someone else in love with you in vain i wish i could have helped myself but love is so much pain it makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain that you will someday surely come and give me love again i knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you and i knew that these many nights i'd be alone and blue and lie awake while you forsake the only love i knew and never learn that you'll return and we would live it through each time i dream a dream i dream we're cuddled arm in arm it seems you're looking straight at me when i see you perform sometimes i think you see my face become so shy and warm i often wonder if you know the power in your charms please let me say i still love you before you hang the phone and i am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own i'm just a name within your past you met while all alone someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown
