someone is waiting lurking in the trees the spirit of her is walking back to me ah look at me now feeling emotion ah look at me now the king of the castle brought her to her knees gave the salvation army girl a squeeze ah look at me now feeling emotion ah look at me now look at me now now she's a sallow face scattering her lace on dewy ground ah i keep searching my head now it's spinning around lifting her head her countenance redeemed re-acted the murder by the silver stream ah look at me now displaying emotion ah look at me now look at me now so cold and yet so brave weave me some wings to take me to her grave ah look at me now feeling emotion ah look at me now look at me now
