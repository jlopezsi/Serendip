in the silence of the side street in the whisper of the night from the darkness of the empty hours to the early morning light from the hustle down on main street with all it's lights so bright to the trucker on the highway pressing through the night i can hear you heartbeat i can hear you heartbeat girl the sound of you is so sweet to me and i'm sailing on your wind song oh i can feel the summer breeze you've got me walking on my tiptoes you've got me standing on my knees from the mills way down in pittsburgh to the clubs of gay paris ah no matter where i roam girl you can always get to me yeah i can hear you heartbeat yeah i can hear you heartbeat girl the sound of you is so sweet to me we got freezing coca-cola we got anything you want i moving on that back beat girl but it's you that sings the song cause i can hear you heartbeat i can hear you heartbeat the sound of you is so sweet to me oh i still hear your heartbeat yea i still hear your heartbeat girl the sound of you is so sweet to me
