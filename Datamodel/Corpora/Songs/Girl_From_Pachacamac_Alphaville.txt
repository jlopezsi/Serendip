i wish i'd had the time to look into your eyes and quietly say the words the words that you'd expect i wish i'd touched your face and you would hold my hand then tears were on our guard and silence was our friend and we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes the struggle and the strife and the black and white and all the letters that we wrote would be printed out in gold in our memories to behold without explanations to be told i dreamt i had the time to listen what you'd say and what you'd say was true and we could start anew i saw u bachstage in that chair dressed up in lies but oh so fair and then i took you by the hand and off we went and we just drank to quench our thirst that never dies and always burns deep in the night out on the streets i'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do and all the poems that we wrote would be printed out in gold in our memories to behold without explanations to be told and we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes the struggle and the strife and the black and white and all the letters that we wrote would be printed out in gold in our memory to behold without explanations and we just drink to quench our thirst that never dies and always burns deep in the night out on the streets i'd like to kiss you too without explanations to be told
