my doctor says i need no cure this time that everything's alright and i am fine but my friends don't agree they say i'm not the one i used to be and it makes me wonder wonder wonder why i'm smiling all the time the only thing i have inside my mind is a picture of you and it's there no matter what i do no matter what i do not know i don't know what it is but i think i'm falling in love i don't know what it is but when i close my eyes you're the one i'm dreaming of i don't know what it is but i'm floating in the sky i don't know what it is and i sure don't know how but you filled my heart with butterflies i'm falling in love seems like all my problems went away i start to make the most of everyday so i spend them with you no one makes me feel the way you do and it makes me wonder wonder wonder about the pain i get inside everytime you're not by my side you have opened a door i have never felt this way before and i want more i don't know i don't know what it is when we are walking i get to hold your hand and that is making me proud i'm screaming out loud i i am a happy man and when we are looking up on a clear blue shy you give me a kiss i wonder who is this lucky guy
