so this is who i am and this is all i know and i must choose to live for all that i can give the spark that makes the power grow and i will stand for my dream if i can symbol of my faith in who i am but you are my only and i must follow on the road that lies ahead and i won't let my heart control my head but you are my only and we don't say goodbye we don't say goodbye and i know what i've got to be immortality i make my journey through eternity i keep the memory of you and me inside fulfill your destiny is there within the child my storm will never end my fate is on the wind the king of hearts the joker's wild we don't say goodbye we don't say goodbye i'll make them all remember me cause i have found a dream that must come true every ounce of me must see it through but you are my only i'm sorry i don't have a role for love to play hand over my heart i'll find my way i will make them give to me immortality there is a vision and a fire in me i keep the memory of you and me inside and we don't say goodbye we don't say goodbye with all my love for you and what else we may do we don't say goodbye
