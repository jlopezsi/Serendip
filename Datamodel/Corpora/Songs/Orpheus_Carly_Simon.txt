orpheus it could have been you could have held me again you said your songs had all gone and that the road back up was too long but it was there for us it was there for us i loved you all along orpheus the part of me that died was ready to be reborn and you called of the hounds of hell with your songs orpheus orpheus i loved you all along orpheus orpheus it could have been you could have held me again but you couldn't wait somewhere along the road you lost your faith out of despair and believing i was gone you gave up on my love you gave up on us but it was there for us it was there for us i loved you all along orpheus
