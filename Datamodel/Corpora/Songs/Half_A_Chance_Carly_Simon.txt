you said we'd light the firmament you said our love was permanent you said we'd stick through thick and thin through up and down through lose and win but comes the first sign of stormy weather you're packin your bags in the trance but you gotta give half a chance half a chance half a chance to our romance you can't pretend it's camelot then start to run when things get hot when love explodes there's always heat there's always bitter with the sweet there's always times when your legs feel broken but you still don't drop out of the dance you gotta give half a chance half a chance half a chance to our romance
