midnight on the water i saw the ocean's daughter walking on a wave she came staring as she called my name and i can't get it out of my head no i can't get it out of my head now my old world is gone for dead cause i can't get it out of my head breakdown on the shoreline can't move it's an ebbtide morning don't get here tonight searching for her silver light and i can't get it out of my head no i can't get it out of my head now my old world is gone for dead cause i can't get it out of my head bank job in the city robin hood and william tell and ivanhoe and lancelot they don't envy me sitting til the sun goes down in dreams the world keeps going round and round and i can't get it out of my head no i can't get it out of my head now my old world is gone for dead cause i can't get it out of my head
