you're sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings you've gone and left my heart in pain all you left is our favorite song the one we danced to all night long it used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be now it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone i oh i sentimental fool am i to hear a old love song and wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me reminding me how in love we used to be keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever breaking up never it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone but it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone precious memories keep a lingering on every time i hear our favorite song now you're gone left this emptiness i only reminisce the happiness we spent we used to dance to the music make romance through the music now it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone now it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone i oh i can't bear to hear it it's the same old song but with a different meaning since you been gone it's the same old song but with a different meaning since
