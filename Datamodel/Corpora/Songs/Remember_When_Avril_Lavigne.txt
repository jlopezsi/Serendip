remember when i cried to you a thousand times i told you everything you know my feelings it never crossed my mind that there would be a time for us to say goodbye what a big surprise but i'm not lost i'm not gone i haven't forgot these feelings i can't shake no more these feelings are running out the door i can feel it falling down and i'm not coming back around these feelings i can't take no more this emptiness in the bottom drawer it's getting harder to pretend and i'm not coming back around again remember when i remember when it was together till the end now i'm alone again where do i begin i cried a little bit you died a little bit please say there's no regrets and say you won't forget but i'm not lost and i'm not gone i haven't forgot these feelings i can't shake no more these feelings are running out the door i can feel it falling down and i'm not coming back around these feelings i can't take no more this emptiness in the bottom drawer it's getting harder to pretend and i'm not coming back around again remember when that was then now it's the end i'm not coming back i can't pretend remember when these feelings i can't shake no more these feelings are running out the door i can feel it falling down and i'm not coming back around these feelings i can't take no more this emptiness in the bottom drawer it's getting harder to pretend and i'm not coming back around again
