how can i forget the night we met i can still remember what you wore i had the strangest feeling like we'd met before maybe it was something that you said how can i forget the night we met how can i forget when we first touched never thought that i would want someone so much i looked in your eyes and then i knew for sure you would be my love forevermore as you slept i kept thinking of the night we met memories come and go like a dream lost in the night but i remember everything about you how you came and changed my life and how can i forget those wedding bells you looked like an angel i remember well how we danced all night and never touched the ground how can i forget the night we met memories come and go like a dream lost in the night but i remember everything about you how you came and changed my life how can i forget your greatest gift i swore i saw your eyes when i first looked at his and when you cried the tears were falling from my eyes as i held our baby held on to his first breath how can i forget the first night that we met and how can i forget that night how can i forget the night we met
