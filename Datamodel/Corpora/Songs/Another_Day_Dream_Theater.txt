live another day climb a little higher find another reason to stay ashes in your hands mercy in your eyes if you're searching for a silent sky you won't find it here look another way you won't find it here so die another day the coldness of his words the message in his silence face the candle to the wind the distance in my voice isn't leaving you a choice so if you're looking for a time to run away you won't find it here look another way you won't find it here so try another day they took pictures of our dreams ran to hide behind the stairs and said maybe when it's right for you they'll fall but if they don't come down resist the need to pull them in and throw them away better to save the mystery than surrender to the secret no you won't find it here look another way you won't find it here so try another day
