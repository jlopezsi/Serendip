she remembered all the shadows and the doubts the same film vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty and the night so still such a small affair a relapse someone closing like the nightclub door here again and when you speak i watch you move away and seem so sure she is hoping to forget and the moment almost slips away when the colours move apart and i wonder if you want to stay and i need to change you like the words i'm reading don't you understand this the warning and the message i remember as you touch my hand
