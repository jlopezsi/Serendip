it's so rare to find a friend like you somehow when you're around the sky is always blue the way we talk the things you say the way you make it all ok and how you know all of my jokes but you laugh anyway if i could wish for one thing i take the smile that you bring wherever you go in this world i'll come along together we dream the same dream forever i'm here for you you're here for me oh oh oh two voices one song now every day is something new and any path we take i'm looking forward to the way we try and never quit the way that all the pieces fit the way we know the parts by heart and sing out loud if i could wish for one thing i take the smile that you bring wherever you go in this world i'll come along together we dream the same dream forever i'm here for you you're here for me oh oh oh two voices one song and anywhere you are you know i'll be around and when you call my name i'll listen for the sound if i could wish for one thing i take the smile that you bring wherever you go in this world i'll come along together we dream the same dream forever i'm here for you you're here for me oh ooh oh two voices one song if i could wish for one thing i take the smile that you bring with you by my side i can go on now i have all that i need and the sweetest sound will always be oh oh oh two voices one song oh oh oh two voices one song oh oh oh two voices one song
