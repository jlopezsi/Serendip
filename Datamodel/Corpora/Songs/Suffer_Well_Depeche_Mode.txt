where were you when i fell from grace frozen heart an empty space something's changing it's in your eyes please don't speak you'll only lie i found treasure not where i thought peace of mind can't be bought still i believe chorus i just hang on suffer well sometimes it's hard it's hard to tell an angel led me when i was blind i said take me back i've changed my mind now i believe from the blackest room i was torn he called my name a love was born so i believe chorus x2
