i'm just another back street kid rock n roll music is the only thing i really dig can't stop the music going round inside my head i'm a rock n roll soldier gonna play it until i'm dead nobody i know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine living in a taxi can't remember where i've been playing my music sitting in my hotel room writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom nobody i know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me living life comes easy if you know which way you're going got to see yourself in other's eye's surprised living like i want to don't come easy but i'm trying sorting out what's true and what are lies it's wise brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands so listen to the music want to see you get so high cause i'm a back street rocker and i will be till the day i die nobody i know is gonna take my rock n roll away from me
