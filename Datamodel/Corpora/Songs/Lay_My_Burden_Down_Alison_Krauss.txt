gonna lay my burden down lay my body in the ground cold clay against my skin but i don't care at all can't seem to find my piece of mind so with the earth i'll lay entwined six feet underground my feet are warm and dry when i get to the other side i'll put your picture way up high but i'm not coming back to you it's just too far if i was cast off on the sea would you come and look for me or would you just let me sink beneath the waves so blue what if i had learned to fly fly all night till day drew nigh touch down upon a branch and scan the crowd for you when i touch my feet on the land i'll kiss your lips and take you in but you know i'm not here to stay it's just too far darling can't you hear me cry my bones are broke my tongue is tied the moon is swaying back and forth against the navy sky is all i can see my body is trembling on my knees just have a little mercy on me run away and hide when i sleep the angels sing but i cannot hear a thing eyes close dreaming of the better days gone by when i wake the trumpets play and i'm standing at the gates fall down and joy i know my race has just been won when i was young my momma would say well life is hard but that's o.k if you can make it through the day it's not that far no it's not that far
