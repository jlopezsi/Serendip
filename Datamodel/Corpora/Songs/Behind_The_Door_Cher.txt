behind the door of every house in every street in every town a story is unfolding a story is unfolding of love and hate the most of us wait of hopes and fears of smiles and tears of dreams that lies a moldering behind the door of every house in every street in every town the stage is set for playing the stage is set for playing and i call crime and punch your mime sweet romance a rich will dance characters are playing behind the door of every house in every street in every town the people are a waiting the people are a waiting to bare and die the years go by the wedding spree the cruelty and still they go on mating and to the one the only one remember when the need of man is greater again the prayers take off ascending all filled of love to the one above asking for asking for asking for asking for a happy ending a happy ending a happy ending
