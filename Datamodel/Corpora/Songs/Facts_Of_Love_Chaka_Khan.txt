back when we first met i think it was november i remember thinking that you had the sweetest smile magic you have it command me i'll obey it's just a fact of love mold me control me i'm only made of clay it's a fact of love chorus sometimes i wonder what is this love at once so delightful and frightening thunder and lightening love the facts of love with those moody broody eyes you could be svengali just one touch i'm mesmerized i just can't help myself you want it you got it you only have to say it's a fact of love you make me feel like i'm only made of clay a fact of love chorus sometimes i wonder about the facts of love i sit and wonder about the facts of love
