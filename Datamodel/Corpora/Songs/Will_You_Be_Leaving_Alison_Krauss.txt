you may walk away in anger wear your heart upon your sleeve you make act like it don't matter keep me laughing while you leave but burning bridges won't get me back if you change your mind some day why can't we turn this scene around before you walk away will you be leaving leaving me today like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand crumbling in our hand i can't live this scene again you may turn away in silence while the tears run down your face say there's nothing left to bind us leaving love without a trace but if i loved you well you'd soon find out why your new love falls some day why can't we burn this heartache down before you walk away will you be leaving leaving me today like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand crumbling in our hand i can't live this scene again will you be leaving leaving me today like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand crumbling in our hand i can't live this scene again
