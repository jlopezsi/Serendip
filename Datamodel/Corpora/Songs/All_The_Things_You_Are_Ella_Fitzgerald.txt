i was blue just as blue as i could be every day was a cloudy day for me then good luck came a-knocking at my door skies were gray but they're not gray anymore blue skies smiling at me nothing but blue skies do i see bluebirds singing a song nothing but bluebirds all day long never saw the sun shining so bright never saw things going so right noticing the days hurrying by when you're in love my how they fly blue days all of them gone nothing but blue skies from now on i should care if the wind blows east or west i should fret if the worst looks like the best i should mind if they say it can't be true i should smile that's exactly what i do
