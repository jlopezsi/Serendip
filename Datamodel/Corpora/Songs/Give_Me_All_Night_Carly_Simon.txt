i have no need of half of anything no half time no half of a man's attention give me all the earth and sky and at the same time add a new dimension half the truth is of no use give it all give it all to me i can stand it i am strong that way give me all night give me the full moon and if i can't take the whole of you give it to me anyway give me all night till the last star fades and if you can't take my heart and soul take it from me anyway don't give me fountains i need waterfalls and when i cry my tears'll fill an ocean the pain of love i'll accept it all as long as you'll join me in that emotion half of lovin is no fun give it all give it all to me i can stand it i am strong that way don't leave me guessing alone don't walk me half the way home you can do that tomorrow just give me give me all night
