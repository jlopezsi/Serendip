this is a song i've been singing for a long time it's like an old friend but you know i think it it's only recently that i discovered what it's really about you've got to give a little take a little and let your poor heart break a little that's the story of that's the glory of love you've got to laugh a little cry a little until the clouds roll by a little that's the story of that's the glory of love as long as there's the two of us we've got the world and all it's charms and when the world is through with us we've got each other's arms you've got to win a little lose a little yes and always have the blues a little that's the story of that's the glory of love that's the story of that's the glory of love
