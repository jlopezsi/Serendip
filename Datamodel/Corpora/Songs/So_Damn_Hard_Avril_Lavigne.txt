i woke up this morning knowing it had to end that useless calling don't you know it drives me round the bend if honesty speaks truth i've said to many lies i'm tied up just let me loose i just can't decide cause i wanted someone to come along and make me feel too damn good but baby you're average and i've had to much of that kind and i don't think i should and i just wish chorus you would not be so good to me then i wouldn't guess i shouldn't and then breaking us apart wouldn't be so hard stop making doing this so damn hard
