in the spring of forty-seven so the story it is told old john sutter went to the mill site found a piece of shining gold well he took it to the city where the word like wildfire spread and old john sutter soon came to wish he'd left that stone in the river bed for they came like herds of locusts every woman child and man in their lumbering conestogas they left their tracks upon the land chorus some would fail and some would prosper some would die and some would kill some would thank the lord for their deliverance and some would curse john sutter's mill well they came from new york city and they came from alabam with their dreams of finding fortunes in this wild unsettled land well some fell prey to hostile arrows as they tried to cross the plains and some were lost in the rocky mountains with their hands froze to the reins oh chorus well some pushed on to california and others stopped to take their rest and by the spring of eighteen-sixty they had opened up the west and then the railroad came behind them and the land was plowed and tamed when old john sutter went to meet his maker he'd not one penny to his name oh chorus and some would curse john sutter's mill some men's thirsts are never filled
