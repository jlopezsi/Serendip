not a soul was stirring not a bird was singing at least not within my hearing i was five minutes past caring standing in the road just staring thought i heard somebody pleading i thought i heard someone apologize some fell down weeping others shook their fists up at the skies and those who were left seemed to be wearing disguises now there's a queen in waiting not enough loving and too much hating for the prince hidden within her man always seems to be hesitating he said let her go let her go god bless her she hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her except every minute of every hour of every day when i wish i could possess her forty days passed by forty alibis so carry on that way and in time you'll pay but we'll all be together come ascension day not a hound was howling or whimpering or prowling now the wind had departed not a leaf was hanging on the tree like when it started but i know they will return like they've never gone away come ascension day
