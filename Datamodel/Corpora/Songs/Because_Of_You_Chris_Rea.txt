i used to hang my head down low never knowing which way i was going my life was getting close to the edge and i knew that it was showing because of you i can stand and hold my head up high because of you i feel free and yet i don't know why each morning is a spring time song with the sun up in the sky the sadness that is on your face helped me to realise i owe each day i have to you and i'll pay you back some day you're reading me like a book but i really would like to say because of you i can stand and hold my head up high because of you i feel free and yet i don't know why yes i do it's you and i'll pay you back some day because of you i have finally found my way
