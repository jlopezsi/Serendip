i'm driving home from work knowing you're not there i used to hurry home now i don't even care the sun is in my eyes so i can't see but when it sets down behind the mountain it's gonna be my first night without you my first night without you my first night without you oh without you i sit here like a fool remembering everything the way we used to talk the songs that we used to sing i've got to try and leave the past behind but my memory's so good i think that i'm losing my mind my first night without you my first night without you and i wonder what i'll do oh without you will i be able to sleep will i lie in my bed and weep what if i forget and reach for you will i dream about you my first night my first night my first night without you my first night without you and i wonder what i'll do oh my first night without you my first night without you and i wonder how i'll get through oh without you
