love comes and goes destiny unknown leads you to the promised land or leaves you head in hand tears fall like rain coming down once again stranger lost in a distant land language hard to understand seems like years have slipped away still have so much left to say and i can't wait to see you chorus when the spirit of love comes to you let it into your heart now's the time to turn away from the ghost of yesterday when the spirit of love comes to you let it into your heart i'll be the one to shelter you the spirit of love will guide us through love right or wrong somehow we must carry on if only words were spoken true if only i could trust in you to believe in the dream of what could be hidden clues to the mystery it's time to set yourself free chorus let the spirit of love come to you let the spirit of love come to you chorus
