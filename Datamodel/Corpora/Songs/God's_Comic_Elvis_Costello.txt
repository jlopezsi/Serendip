i wish you'd known me when i was alive i was a funny feller the crowd would hoot and holler for more i wore a drunk's red nose for applause oh yes i was a comical priest with a joke for the flock and a hand up your fleece drooling the drink and the lipstick and greasepaint down the cardboard front of my dirty dog-collar chorus now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead and i'm going on to meet my reward i was scared i was scared i was scared i was scared he might of never heard god's comic so there he was on a water-bed drinking a cola of a mystery brand reading an airport novelette listening to andrew lloyd-webber's requiem he said before it had really begun i prefer the one about my son i've been wading through all this unbelievable junk and wondering if i should have given the world to the monkeys chorus i'm going to take a little trip down paradise's endless shores they say that travel broadens the mind til you can't get your head out of doors i'm sitting here on the top of the world i hang around in the longest night until each beast has gone bed and then i say god bless and turn out the light while you lie in the dark afraid to breathe and you beg and you promise and you bargain and you plead sometimes you confuse me with santa claus it's the big white beard i suppose i'm going up to the pole where you folks die of cold i might be gone for a while if you need me now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead and you're all going on to meet your reward are you scared are you scared are you scared are you scared you might have never heard but god's comic
