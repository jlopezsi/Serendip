i wish i could forget you but i won't i wish i loved another but i don't it's just the same day after day your memory keeps getting in my way but i'm hoping i will be alright but i don't even sleep at night i close my eyes i see your face your memory keeps getting in my way i don't know why i can't forget you i don't see why i should let you keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday your memory keeps getting in my way it's easy for someone to lie i'm saying i'll forget you and i'll try here's hoping that i will someday your memory keeps getting in my way i don't know why i can't forget you i don't see why i should let you keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday your memory keeps getting in my way
