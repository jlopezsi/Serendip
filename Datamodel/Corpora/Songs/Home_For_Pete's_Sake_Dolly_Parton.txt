i became a woman of the world cause i was fed up with the farm and i thought pretty clothes and city lights running round both day and night could do no harm a party girl i mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild so i wrote my dad and mom asked if i could come back home to have my child i received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine they went on to say that pete the boy i broke up with was about to lose his mind but i couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears i'm feelin so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares so i'm going home for pete's sake it was i who broke his heart in the first place if he'll try me one more time for then i've made up my mind and in the morning i'm going home for pete's sake yes for pete's sake my baby's and mine
