i blew the dust out of the corners threw some dead wood on the fire tuned the radio to silence watched the evening sun expire should have called you up this morning but i'm such a fool at times i still search my shaving mirror looking for your face with mine and i can't stay alone tonight can't let another day go by why is it always this way time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i can't stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i can't stay alone tonight chalk up one more crazy notion imagination running wild but if i needed confirmation i would have gone that extra mile you're the last chance on the highway i'm that open stretch of road you're the diner in my rear-view a cup of coffee getting cold and i can't stay alone tonight can't let another day go by why is it always this way time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i can't stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i can't stay alone tonight bruised in this cold war of words we've come undone two loose ends alone possessed by that curse you've endured the spell that i cast couldn't make you come home and i can't stay alone tonight can't let another day go by why is it always this way time never seems to really fly and time is never really on my side and i can't stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i can't stay alone tonight things have to change and they might but i can't stay alone tonight
