i know i'll miss her later wish i could bend my love to hate her wish i could be her creator to twist her arms now she stares up at the stars when the stars fell from her hair then i bent down to collect them and then she was gone oh i sleep just to dream her i beg the night just to see her that my only love should be her just to lie in her arms oh i came there to find out find out she'd made up her mind oh my arms are all tied up to me she was blind this space between us where wingless dreams fall earless will you not bear me witness with your back to me now it seemed so unnerving still somehow deserving that she could hold my heart so tightly and still not see me here oh oh i sleep just to dream her beg the night just to see her that my only love should be her just to lie in her arms i know i'll miss her later wish i could bend my love to hate her wish i could be her creator to be the light in her eyes
