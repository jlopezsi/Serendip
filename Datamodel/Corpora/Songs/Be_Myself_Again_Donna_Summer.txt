let me introduce myself i'm a woman that you've never seen you might know me from somewhere else as someone that i've never been i gave everything to play the game my soul fell apart at the seams i fell down like a house of cards when somebody pulled the queen chorus cause you could spend your life lookin for your own reflection time could blur the lines between what's real and what's projected had i known what i lost what i gained what it'd cost i'd still give what remains to be myself again you must believe me when i say don't live someone else's design turn it around like a photograph the writings been there all the time now you can have all these hopes and dreams the ones i can't use anymore i don't know what it is you lost but i hope you got what you came for chorus sometimes i want to leave right now sometimes i want to cry out loud i want to let it all hang out but i don't want to let you down sometimes i want to just lay here sometimes i want to disappear i want to show you all my fear but i don't want to let you down chorus to be myself again
