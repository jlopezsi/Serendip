i look inside at the scarlet room places to hide in the dusty gloom a noisy clock and a silver spoon a china cup on the mantlepiece gathering dust as it did in the east and just outside lies the garden of peace oh tell me is this really true can it be peace has come to me and you tell me over over and over tell me is this really happening inside this world it's beautiful peace in this garden has come true a mirror pond reflects the dawn over the banks cross the emerald lawn a breeze has come and i'm carried along so follow the path through the knowing trees and each time you laugh it is love you release that love will come back in the garden of peace so tell me is this really true can it be peace has come to me and you tell me over over and over tell me is this really happening inside this world it's beautiful peace in the garden has come true oh tell me is this really true can it be peace has come to me and you tell me over over and over tell me is this really happening inside this world it's beautiful peace in the garden has come true
