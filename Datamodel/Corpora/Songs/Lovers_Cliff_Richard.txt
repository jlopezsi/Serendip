once they were lovers but now they're not friends she's found another and he says it's the end to think they once tore down a wall for a door but now they don't speak anymore so he walks the streets the few nights he can stand drinking her memory away when he can friends once would reach out to them from the shore but now they don't cry anymore how does it all come to happen that's not what loving is for and if i thought it was,i would leave here in the morning i'd sooner sleep on the floor oh when will we learn really what loving is it's not what you get in return but what you give to think they once tore down a wall for a door but now they don't speak anymore
