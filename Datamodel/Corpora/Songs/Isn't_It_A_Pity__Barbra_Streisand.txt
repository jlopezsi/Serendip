it's a funny thing i look at you i get a thrill i never knew isn't it a pity we never met before here we are at last it's like a dream the two of us a perfect team isn't it a pity we never met before imagine all the lonely years we've wasted me with the neighbors you at silly labors what joys untasted my nights were sour spent with schopenhauer let's forget the past let's both agree that i'm for you and you're for me and it's such a pity we never never met before imagine all the years we've wasted fishing for salmon losing at backgammon what joys untasted me at the prado you in colorado happiest of girls i'm sure to be if only you would say to me that it's such a pity we never met before what an awful pity we never never met before
