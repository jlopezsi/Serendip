i know it's over before she says i know the falls that the water face i know it's over an ocean that waits for a storm the sun on snow rivers in rain crystal ball can foresee a change and i know it's over a parting of ways and it's done but didn't we have fun don't say it was all a waste didn't we have fun from the top of the world the top of the waves we said forever forever always we could have been lost we would have been saved now we're stopping the world stopping it's spin come on don't give up don't say we give in don't say it's over don't say we're done oh didn't we have fun oh didn't we have fun i know it's over before she says now someone else has taken your place i know it's over icarus says to the sun the sword sinks in lightning strikes and two forces two forces collide and the fight til it's over fight til it's done oh didn't we have fun don't say it was all a waste didn't we have fun from the top of the world the top of the waves we said forever forever always we could have been lost we would have been saved now we're stopping the world stopping it in it's tracks but nothing's too broken to find a way back so before it's over before you run didn't we have fun cause you and me we were always meant to always meant to be we were always meant to always meant to you and me we were always meant to always meant to be oh didn't we have fun oh didn't we have fun but then maybe we could again
