blue blue is the color of skies blue is the color of your eyes your beautiful blue eyes black black is the color you wore black is the promise you made before you closed the door and never told me why i'm black and blue because of you i feel like i've been beaten you walked away from me leaving me all black and blue you you used to sleep by my side you swore you had nothing to hide and now there's nothing left to lose night night after long endless night you swore you had nothing to hide and i was so naive to believe your lies i'm black and blue because of you i feel like i've been beaten you walked away from me leaving me all black and blue down in the depths of your soul i hear the echo and the sigh that your secrets can not hide they never lie to me night night after long endless night you swore you had nothing to hide and i was so naive to believe your lies i'm black and blue because of you i feel like i've been beaten you walked away from me leaving me all black and blue broken in two because of you i feel like i've been beaten you walked away from me leaving me all black and blue black and blue because of you i feel like i've been beaten you walked away having me all black and blue
