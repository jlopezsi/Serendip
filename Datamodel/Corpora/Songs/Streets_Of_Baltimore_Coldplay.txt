well i sold the farm to take my woman where she used to be we left our kin and all our friends back there in tennessee and i bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for and they took us to the streets of baltimore well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights she said the prettiest place on earth was baltimore at night well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for and i kinda liked the streets of baltimore then i got myself a factory job i ran an old machine and i bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene and every night when i'd come home with every muscle sore she'd drag me through the streets of baltimore well i did my best to bring her back to what she used to be then i soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me now i'm a going back on that same train that brought me here before while my baby walks the streets of baltimore while my baby walks the streets of baltimore
