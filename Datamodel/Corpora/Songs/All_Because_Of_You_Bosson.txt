chorus it's all because of you yeah you it's all because of you nobody else makes me feel like you do i have the time of my life and it's all because of you if i was able to thank you for coming into my life if i was able to tell the whole world how i feel my love is for real if i was able to write a song i would have filled it with love if i was able to open my heart you would see i'm so happy chorus if i was able to live my life over again i'd share the minutes with you if i was able to count the times you bring out the sun when i'm feeling down if i was able to explain how you have opened my eyes i sure have tried about thousand times i just feel so alive chorus 2x i found the meaning i cherish my life now i see everything in colors so bright and when it's raining i still feel the sun so take a good look i'm walking clouds chorus
