if the sky should fall into the sea and the stars fade all around me all the times that we have known here i will sing a hymn to love we have lived and dreamed we two alone in a world that's been our very own with it's memories ever grateful just for you i sing a hymn to love i remember each embrace the smile that lights your face and my heart begins to sing your eyes have never lied and my heart begins to sing and my heart begins to sing if one day you should ever disappear always remember these words if one day we had to say goodbye and our love should fade away and die in my heart you will remain here and i'ii sing a hymn to love o for love we live eternally in the blue we'll roll this harmony with every day we are in heaven as for you i'll sing a hymn to love don't you ever worry dear and the stars shall fade from the sky all the times that we have known here i will sing a hymn to our love oh darling just for you i sing a hymn to love
