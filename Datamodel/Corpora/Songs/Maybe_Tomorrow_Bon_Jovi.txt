seems like years since i've been home living this dream on the endless roads faces in the crowd they stare at me yours is the only one i wanted to see my heart cries out for sympathy but i need to hold you next to me and it won't be long baby maybe tomorrow these hotel rooms they're all the same only the number on the door will be changed lord i gotta do me one more show then it's into the bus and off we go should have talked to you well i don't have to try when i find the music in your eyes and i'm telling myself that we'll take that ride baby maybe tomorrow i should've talked to you well i don't got to try where i can find the music in your eyes we're all blind two lovers into the night maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow maybe tomorrow
