when winter calls and the wind won't wait look through the rain see the leaves start to break once so alone like a prayer on the sea nothing to hide so much there to see don't be afraid don't be afraid the thoughts you wear like a long lost friend are buried so deep that you can't see them end you know spring will come just as quick as you need and run straight to you when the dark nights are freed don't be afraid don't be afraid don't be afraid don't be afraid
