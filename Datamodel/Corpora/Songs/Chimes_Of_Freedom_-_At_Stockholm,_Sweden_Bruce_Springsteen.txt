well far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll we ducked inside the doorway thunder crashing as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing yeah flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight and for each and every underdog soldier in the night we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing well in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched with faces hidden here while the walls were tightening as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain dissolved into the wild bales of lightning yeah tolling for the rebel yeah tolling for the rake tolling for the luckless the abandoned and forsaken yeah tolling for the outcast burning constantly at stake and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing alright now and then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed as the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting well electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting well tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail for the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale and for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing well starry-eyed and laughing i recall when we were caught trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended as we listened one last time and we watched with one last look spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended yeah tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed for the countless confused accused misused strung out ones and worse and for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe yeah and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing alright now whoa whoa whoa well whoa whoa whoa whoa well whoa whoa whoa well whoa whoa whoa
