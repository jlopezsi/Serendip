eyes make their peace in difficulties with wounded lips and salted cheeks and finally we step to leave to the departure lounge of disbelief and i don't know where i'm going but i know it's gonna be a long time and i'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight wanna hear your beating heart tonight before the bleeding sun comes alive i want to make the best of what is left hold tight and hear my beating heart one last time before daylight and the canyon underneath the trees behind the dark sky you looked at me i fell for you like autumn leaves never faded evergreen and i don't know where i'm going but i know it's gonna be a long time cause i'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight wanna hear your beating heart tonight before the bleeding sun comes alive i want to make the best of what is left hold tight and hear my beating heart one last time i can't face now everything has changed i just wanna be by your side here's hoping we collide here's hoping we collide here's hoping we collide wanna hear your beating heart tonight before the bleeding sun comes alive i wanna make the best of what is left hold tight and hear my beating heart one last time wanna hear your beating heart tonight
