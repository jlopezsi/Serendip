i know what it's like to have failed baby with the whole world lookin on i know what it's like to have soared and come crashin like a drunk on a bar room floor now you got no reason to trust me my confidence is a little rusty but if you don't feel like bein alone baby i could walk you all the way home well now our old fears and failures baby they do linger like the shadow of that ring that was on your finger those days they've come and gone baby i could walk you all the way home love leaves nothin but shadows and vapor we go on as is our sad nature now it's some old stones song the band is trashin but if you feel like dancin baby i'm askin it's comin on closing time bartender he's ringin last call these days i don't stand on pride and i ain't afraid to take a fall so if you're seein what you like maybe your first choice he's gone well that's all right baby i could walk you all the way home baby i could walk you all the way home
