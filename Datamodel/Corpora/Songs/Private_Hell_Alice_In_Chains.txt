give away a love and then remove another too painted words adorn the walls echoing untrue i feel cold promises abound you rarely find it to begin maybe i'm afraid to let you all the way in i guess so i excuse myself i'm used to my little cell i amuse myself in my very own private hell lately i'm beside myself pretending unconcerned standing on a corner where i threw you on a turn i'll move on flowers on a cross remain mark an ending scene damn it all if blood you spill turn the grass more green life is short i excuse myself i'm used to my little cell i amuse myself in my very own private hell
