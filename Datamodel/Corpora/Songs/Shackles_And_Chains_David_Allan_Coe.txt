on a long lonesome journey i am going so my sweet little darling don't cry for in shackles and chains they will take me to a prison to live till i die chorus and each night threw the bars i will gaze at the stars my dreams dear of you so in vain a piece of stone i will use for my pillow while i'm sleeping in shackles and chains put your arms threw these bars once more darling let me kiss your sweet lips i love best for in sorrow they were my conculution and in sadness my haven of rest repeat chorus
