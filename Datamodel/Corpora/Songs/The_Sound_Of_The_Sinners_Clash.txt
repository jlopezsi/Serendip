as the floods of god wash away sin city they say it was written in the page of the lord but i was looking for that great jazz note that destroyed the walls of jericho the winds of fear whip away the sickness the messages on the tablet was valium as the planets form that golden cross lord i'll see you on the holy cross roads after all this time to believe in jesus after all those drugs i thought i was him after all my lying and a-crying and my suffering i ain't good enough i ain't clean enough to be him the tribal wars burning up the homeland the fuel of evil is raining from the sky the sea of lava flowing down the mountain the time will sleep us sinners by holy rollers roll give generously now pass the hubcap please thank you lord
