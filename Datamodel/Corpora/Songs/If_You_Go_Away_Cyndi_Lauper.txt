if you go away on this summer day then you might as well take the sun away all the birds that flew in the summer sky and our love was new and our hearts were high when the day was young and the night was long and the moon stood still for the night bird song if you go away if you go away if you go away but if you stay i'll make you a day like no day has ever been or will be again we'll sail on the sun we'll ride on the rain we'll talk to the trees and worship the wind and if you go i'll understand leave me just enough love to hold in my hand if you go away if you go away if you go away if you go away as i know you will you must tell the world to stop turning till you return to me if you ever do oh what good is love without loving you i can tell you now as you turn to go i'll be dying slowly till your next hello if you go away if you go away if you go away but if you stay i'll make you a night like no night has ever been or will be again i'll sail on you smile i'll ride on your touch i'll talk to your eyes that i love so much but if you go i'll understand leave me just enough love to hold in my hand if you go away if you go away if you go away if you go away if you go away as i know you must there is nothing left in this world to trust just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look i see on your face i'd have been the shadow of your shadow if you might have kept me by your side if you go away if you go away if you go away
