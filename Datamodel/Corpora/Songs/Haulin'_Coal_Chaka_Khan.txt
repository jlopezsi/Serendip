steamin down the muddy waters travelin yonder from bay to bay i been workin on the barge line fourteen years ago today eighteen hours hard labor by the day ain't much pay for a man chorus haulin coal down the down river and he won't be comin home for a long time torches burning by the riverside cast their shadows grey as stone and the cool october days replacing much warmer thoughts of home i can still see grandma sittin on the porch tellin the neighbors she's got a grandson chorus haulin coal down the down river and he won't be comin home for a long time river's rising up the marker line while the willows softly moan sun is rising over the starboard shore paving the golden road back home i can still see the kids jumpin rope but there ain't much hope for a man chorus haulin coal down the down river and he won't be comin home for a long time haulin coal down the down river i'll be gone a long time haulin coal down the down river i'll be gone a long while
