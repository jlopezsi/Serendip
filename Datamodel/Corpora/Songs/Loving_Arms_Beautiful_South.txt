t jans originally performed by etta james if you could hear me now the one who said that she'd rather roam the one who said she'd rather be alone if you could only hear me now if i could hold you now just for a moment i could really make you mine just for a while turn back the hands of time if i could only hold you now cause i've been too long in the wind and too long in the rain taking any comfort that i can looking back and hoping for the freedom of my chains and lying in your loving arms again if you could see me now singing somewhere through the lonely night and dreaming of the love that held me tight if you could only see me now cause i've been too long in the wind and too long in the rain taking any comfort that i can looking back and hoping for the freedom of my chains and lying in your loving arms again i can almost feel your loving arms again i can almost feel your loving arms again
