i can't believe that i've found you fate did a number on me if you end up with my arms around you it's meant to be well maybe my crazy is showing but maybe i'm hooked on your touch but wherever my life is going there ain't no rush cause wherever you're going i'd like to go too if you don't have anything better to do i'd love to spend some more time together so what are you doing between now and forever i'll take the blue with the gray days i just pray the road will be long cause if i'm beside you there's no way i can go wrong wherever you're going i'd like to go too if you don't have anything better to do i'd love to spend some more time together so what are you doing between now and forever i'd love to spend some more time together so what are you doing between now and forever what are you doing between now and forever
