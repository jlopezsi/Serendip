it's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen a lady down on love and out of hope and dreams the ties that once bound her now are broke away and she's like a baby just learning how to play she never thought that love could ever end so soon her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon when he asked her to marry and she glady said o.k and a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday now she's a lady down on love she needs somebody to gently pick her up she's got her freedom but she'd rather be bound to a man who would love her and never let her down well i know a lady that's down on her love cause i used to hold her and have that special touch but work took me a way from home late at nights and i wasn't there when she turned out the lights then both of us got lonely and i gave into lust and she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust now she's a lady down on love she needs somebody to gently pick her up she's got her freedom but she'd rather be bound to man who would love her and never let her down now she's a lady down on love
