walk me over this horizon let the sun's light warm my face once again the times are changin once again i lost my way well the words of ancient poets fall like dust upon my shoes greed has robbed me of my vision turned my heart from higher truths so take my hand and lift me higher be my love and my desire hold me safe and honor bound take my heart to higher ground i have walked too long in darkness i have walked too long alone blindly clutching fists of diamonds that i found were only stones i would trade the world of ages for a warmer hand to hold the path of light is narrow but it leads to streets of gold so take my hand and lift me higher be my love and my desire hold me safe and honor bound take my heart to higher ground in this world we move through shadows never sure of what we see while the truth that lies between us come and share the truth with me so take my hand and lift me higher be my love and my desire hold me safe and honor bound take my heart to higher higher ground hmm hmm hmm hmm
