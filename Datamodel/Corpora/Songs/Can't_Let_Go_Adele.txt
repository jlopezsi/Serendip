verse 1 when did it go wrong i will never know i have loved you all my life how did it slow down i go round and round thinking about it all the time pre-chorus i gave you heaven on a platter baby i gave you everything you never gave me i never lied and i never faked it only wanted for you to save me this love it ain't over yet there's too much that i haven't said chorus did you find the note that i wrote i hid it in the seam of your coat it was hard to write with a lump in my throat do you even know i can't let go verse 2 why were you so cold let the truth be told tell me was it all for the thrill what was i thinking i gave you everything but you still went for the kill pre-chorus i gave you heaven on a platter baby i gave you everything you never gave me i never lied and i never faked it only wanted for you to save me chorus did you find the note that i wrote i hid it in the seam of your coat it was hard to write with a lump in my throat do you even know i can't let go bridge oooh sometimes i feel like i'm in the dark oooh i thought i'd die in your arms chorus did you find the note that i wrote i hid it in the seam of your coat it was hard to write i had a lump in my throat do you even know that i can't let go outro hope you know i won't let go
