i'm in such a mood turned on by the thought of you you're not around so i just sit here and brood amongst a lethal combination kind of midnight mood sedation i miss you but that's another kind of silence sittin by the fire stare into the flames without you i'm as lonely as the night train chorus and miles is blowin cool through the room i wish that i could be there with you was it the strike of two or the sound of his blues you're going to my head and miles is blowin through the room gypsy music for lonely hearts takes care of me while we're apart if you were here i'd be dancing with you how long must you keep me waiting can't you see the toll it's taking i need you but that's another kind of maddness now i'm almost through a solo bottle of champagne and i'm half way through sketches of spain chorus and miles is blowin cool through the room i wish that i could be there with you was it the strike of two or the sound of his blues you're going to my head and miles is blowin through the room
