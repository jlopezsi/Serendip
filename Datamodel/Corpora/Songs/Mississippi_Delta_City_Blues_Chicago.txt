i've got a smile that i put on when i'm not at home when i'm not alone but it is so hard to make that smile cause i know i'll be at home and alone in a while and if i look in a mirror i see my eyes start to tear i can't help but cry since you said goodbye i've got to hide what i'm feelin inside can't let them see how you're hurtin me so i guess that's what i'll do won't let them see through won't let them know that you could hurt me so i've got a laugh that i put on when i'm not at home when i'm not alone but it is so hard to fake that laugh when my insides are cryin and my heart's torn in half and all the music i hear and things i valued so dear make me feel so blue they all remind me of you now what can i do now that our love is through and my purpose is gone still i got to live on i guess that's what i'll do i won't let them see through i won't let them know that you could hurt me so
