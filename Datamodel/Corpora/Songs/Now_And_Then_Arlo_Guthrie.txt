hello again the mornin dawn has burned away the midnight mist now and then i feel so fine and now and then i don't feel lonely now and then and only in my mind i want to go outside today go away i think i'll stay now and then i talk with you and now and then you turn me on now and then and when i don't feel blue maybe i could tell you now that i really love you pleased to understand that you are there in the air now and then you turn me on now and then you must be gone now and then i said say so long now and forever then
