my eyes are so tired they should sleep but they won't they don't they won't let me pass this up my eyes are stuck open in love they want more of him they need less of this they're everything they're unbelievable my eyes are lonely and cold they're young and they're old they're looking for a way out and a moment to let you in they want nothing to do with me and only want to do with him they're hungry i'm warning and i'm scared and they won't let me thrive they'll need everything you own make it all so real by learning to feel it's not really happening what's going on is much more than i ever hoped for ever hoped for and i'd much rather imagine it then not live at all
