our prayers have been answered i finally arrived the healing that had been delayed is now realized no one's in a hurry there's no schedule to keep we're all enjoying jesus just sitting at his feet if you could see me now i'm walking streets of gold if you could see me now i'm standing tall and whole if you could see me now you'd know i've seen his face if you could see me now you'd know the pain's erased you wouldn't want me to ever leave this place if only you could see me now my light and temporary trials have worked out for my good to know it brought him glory when i misunderstood though we've had our sorrows they can never compare to what jesus has in store for us no language can share
