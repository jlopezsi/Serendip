words and music by pete seeger sailng down my golden river sun and water all my own yet i was never alone sun and water old life givers l'll have them where ere i roam and i was not far from home sunlight glancing on the water life and death are all my own yet i was never alone life for all my sons and daughters golden sparkles in the foam and i was not far from home sailing down this winding highway travelers from near and far and i was never alone exploring all the little byways sighting all the distant stars and i was not far from home sailing down my golden river sun and water all my own yet i was never alone sun and water old life givers l'll have them where ere i roam and i was not far from home yet i was never alone and i was not far from home
