i've an emptiness inside that can only be describe as a sad song with the paint all peeling off all the world i used to know it's a sad song he gave my life a meaning when all hope inside had die the he took the meaning back and left me feeling oh disillusioned he just walked out of my world like you'd walk out of a room oh you sad song sing along with my song if you're lost and you're alone sing along if your song has theme of love gone wrong sing along and belong don't hold back we're growing strong sing along sing your song sing your sad your sad sad song ain't it strange the way life goes first you're used and then disposed like a sad song saying love was just a word used to keep you hanging there like a sad song you swallowed all those promises so called upon you are and following his footsteps no matter just how far must follow he just walked out of a room oh you sad song sing along with my song if you're lost and you're alone sing along if your song has theme of love gone wrong sing along and belong don't hold back we're growing strong sing along sing your song sing your sad you sad sad song
