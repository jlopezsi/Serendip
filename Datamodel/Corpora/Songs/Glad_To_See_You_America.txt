bells ring in in my ear voices i hear whispering daily to me love in your fire high on a wire when i know you're near me god i'm glad to see you i thought you'd left me far away i wouldn't give much to be you but i want you to know i feel this way all over the world flags are being unfurled waving before the dawning i'm watching the show the last one to know which way that things are going god i'm glad to know you i thought you'd left me far away i wouldn't give much to be you but i want you to know i feel this way cars fighting their way out of l.a on a sunday morning i'm watching the show the last one to know which way that things are going god i'm glad to see you i thought you'd left me far away i wouldn't give much to be you but i want you to know i feel this way god i'm glad to know you
