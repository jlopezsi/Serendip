last night she made it plain she didn't want me today i woke later and alone tomorrow i'll be turnin to the bottle tonight i'll be cold and all alone she only broke my heart lord not my spirit she only took my body not my soul my skin still burns in places where she touched me and when she touched me lord i lost my self-control when she's got me where she wants me she don't want me i'm just another game she likes to play i don't think i can make it through tomorrow i almost never made it through today she sure knew how to love me when she loved me when i was weak she always came on strong she knew just what it took to drive me crazy and she knew how much i hate to be alone when she's got me where she wants me
