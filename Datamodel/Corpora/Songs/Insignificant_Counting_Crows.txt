can you see me up on a building from down on the pavement or out in the crowd can you see me in the glare of the lamp post cause i am walking a tightrope into the moon chorus i don't want feel so different but i don't want to be insignificant and i don't how to see the same things different now oh can you see me i am one in a million yeah i'm icarus falling out of the sun she sees me falling a line of spotlights and chalk lines through night black as a bedroom and white as a lie chorus diving through the dark while the night turns blue and you wear your intentions as i wear my intentions so clear guitar bridge if you see me wading through water or come drowning a river right in front of the world hey you can wash your face and hands in the stream of my anger cause it's as bright as white paper as dark as a girl chorus x2
