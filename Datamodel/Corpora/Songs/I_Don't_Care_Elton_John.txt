i got feet sticking out of my shoes i got heat more than i can use i got love i got all i need i got soles that are wearing thin i got holes where the rain gets in i got you and that's enough for me i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care long as i got your love clothes that are falling apart i got a car that refuses to start i got love i do the best i can i got bills piling up in the hall i got paint peeling off the wall i got you i'm a happy man
