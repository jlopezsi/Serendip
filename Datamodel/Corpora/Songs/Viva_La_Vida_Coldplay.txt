i used to rule the world seas would rise when i gave the word now in the morning i sleep alone sweep the streets i used to own i used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead long live the king one minute i held the key next the walls were closed on me and i discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand i hear jerusalem bells are ringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field for some reason i can't explain once you go there was never never an honest word that was when i ruled the world it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what i'd become revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever want to be king chorus i hear jerusalem bells are ringing roman calvary choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never rule this world but that was when i ruled the world oh oh oh oh oh chorus
