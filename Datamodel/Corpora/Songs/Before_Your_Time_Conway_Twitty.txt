other arms have held me before your time other lips have thrilled me before your time other eyes have seen the light you see in my eyes tonight oh but darling that was long before your time other hearts have been broken before your time unkind words were spoken before your time other ears have heard me say the things i say to you today but darling that was long before your time before you came along i sang this same old song before the melody was born when we walk right to love's door the words i love you came but i just couldn't sing that line oh but darling that was long before your time before you came along
