wish everybody would leave me alone yeah they're always calling on my telephone when i pick it up there's no one there so i walk outside just to take the air come on with me cruising down the street who knows what you'll see who you might meet this brave new world's not like yesterday it can take you higher than the milky way now i'm blinded i can't really see yeah no more bright lights confusing me no don't ask me why i'm feeling blue cause loving you is all i can do hey good-looking boys gather around the sidewalk papers gutter-press you down all those lies can be so unkind they can make you feel like you're losing your mind street life street life street life what a life back to nature boys vasser girls too watch what you say or think or do continental-style strasse girls might but you know exactly if it's wrong or right education is an important key yes but the good life's never won by degrees no pointless passing through harvard or yale only window shopping it's strictly no sale week end starts friday soon after eight your jet black magic helps you celebrate you may be stranded if you stick around and that's really something
