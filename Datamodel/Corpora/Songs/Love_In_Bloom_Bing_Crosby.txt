blue night and you alone with me my heart has never known such ecstasy am i on earth am i in heaven can it be the trees that fill the breeze with rare and magic perfume oh no it isn't the trees it's love in bloom can it be the spring that seems to bring the stars right into this room oh no it isn't the spring it's love in bloom my heart was a desert you planted a seed and this is the flower this hour of sweet fulfillment is it all a dream the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom you know it isn't a dream it's love in bloom my heart was a desert but you planted a seed and this is the flower this hour of sweet fulfillment is it all a dream the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom you know it isn't a dream it's love in bloom
