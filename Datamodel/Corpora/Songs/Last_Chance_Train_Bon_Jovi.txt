october leaves are falling so am i a harvest moon is calling me and i know why the traffic's like a symphony in blue in the autumn air i smell your sweet perfume i miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room yesterdays are eating me alive i'm your angel baby i've got broken wings i can't walk i can't run i can't drop until you're next to me so the only thing you gotta meet me tonight i'm on a last chance train leave a flower the station i know my destination love bring me home again you try to reach me but i've sailed away you tried to read me but my words got in the way the music's over but the dance has just begun i wish that i could just get back to baltimore you know i'd scratch i'd claw i'd scream till i'm raw just to fall down at your door you gotta meet me tonight i'm on a last chance train leave a flower at the station i know my destination love bring me home again let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks at the broken hearts that don't come back cause the train has left the station with my pain let them forget my name oh i'm on a last chance train sitting here i smoke my nineteenth cigarette now all that's left are ashes butts and my regrets it's your taste that i just can't forget you gotta meet me tonight i'm on a last chance train let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks at the broken hearts that don't come back we'll be laughing at them crying in the rain it's you and i again oh you gotta meet me tonight i'm on a last chance train leave a flower at the station i know my destination love bring me home again i'm on a last chance train it's gonna bring me home to you oh the last chance train coming through my babe this time i'm coming through coming through
