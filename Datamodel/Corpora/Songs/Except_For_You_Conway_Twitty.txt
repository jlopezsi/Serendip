except for you i've never known what love is or how it feels to have a dream come true but now i find my world no longer lonely the way that it would be except for you one by one you mended all the pieces of a heart that someone broke in two you filled my life with happiness and sunshine that i never would have known except for you you brought all the rainbow colors to a world of solid blue there's nothin prettier than rainbows except for you and so my love i wanted just to tell you this old heart won't beat again except for you my old heart won't beat again except for you
