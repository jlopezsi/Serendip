you stick to me when i wish you gone you hammer on my thoughts through dreams your plot is thick with saucy schemes and ways to reach my balconies but i say i'm not turned on by the way you look i say i'm not turned on by the way you act i'm not turned on when you tell me that you need me but sometimes just sometimes you can see the softness in my eyes and you know it's just not true you're in my blood a holy ghost i scream but it's a hollow plea the thoughts i swallow leave me thirsty you do a very fine imitation of me and i say i'm not turned on by the way you laugh i'm not turned on by the way you smile i'm not turned on when you tell me that you love me but sometimes just sometimes you can see the softness in my eyes and you know it's just not true and i say i'm not turned on by the way you dance i'm not turned on my the way you laugh i'm not turned on when you need me but sometimes just sometimes you can see the softness in my eyes and you know it's just not true
