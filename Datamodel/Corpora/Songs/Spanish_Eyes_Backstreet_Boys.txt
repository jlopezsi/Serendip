here we are in the arms of one another and we still go on searching for each other knowing that hate is wrong and love is right for us tonight when i look into your spanish eyes i know the reason why i am alive and the world is so beautiful tonight chorus it's a place i've never been and it comes from deep within and it's telling me that i'm about to win first prize knowing all i have to do is reach out my hand to you anytime i want to look into your spanish eyes let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers who believe that we see no wall between us how can they be in my heart and in my mind when all i could find when i look into your spanish eyes i know the reason why i am alive and the world is so beautiful tonight chorus i loved you from a distance thought i couldn't reach that far i can't believe how close that we are when i look into your spanish eyes and the world is so beautiful tonight chorus
