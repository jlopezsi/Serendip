sometimes when i'm thinkin that love's not around my heart begins sinkin i don't hear a sound and the world is in blackness no light shines on me i suffer no blindness no one can i see then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire and the silence is broken and the night is on fire chorus it's like chain lightning this love that i feel who know's where it strikes or when it will hit how long it will last or when it will quit in the forest i'm burning struck down by the blast the fever is churning and the heat rises fast and those standing nearest can show their concern but i swear if they touch me that they too will burn they fear for their lives for death will soon dwell in the warmth of your love is the fire of hell chorus and soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame and love will soon shatter what it cannot tame and the cycle continues from life into dust for i am now in you with the fire of lust and i hear the explosion of thunder and rain the water is falling the ashes remain chorus the indian's tell us that the phoenix can rise from the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes and watch beautiful colours from black and from grey be formed into wings and take me away where evil is darkness and goodness is light and love is the lightning that cuts through the night and strikes only once in a dark place in time and forms a gold stairway that all of us climb
