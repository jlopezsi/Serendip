how long do i have to wait before i can tell you the things i've been wanting to say how long must i hesitate i know it makes sense but it's hard for me to stay away but if this is how it has to be maybe it's just a feeling that i could name but i'd probably best blame impatience you can't miss what you've never known it's quite absurd how you started disturbing me so sometimes when i am all alone i lose my senses i have no defenses to go but if this is how i lose my heart then i shall just embrace that my pulse is racing still i'm secretly thrilled by the laughter that tumbled and the tears that i spilled as far as i know no one ever got killed by impatience tell me is there danger still i took no heed so a word might as well be deed although i'd really like to see you now i'm almost certain it can't be accomplished with speed so if this is how i'll bide my time then i will set it down til we lose our caution i'll honor your order cause it's such sweet torture to carry this torch in the light of temptation beyond conversation and all expectation pausing a moment or two just to mention impatience
