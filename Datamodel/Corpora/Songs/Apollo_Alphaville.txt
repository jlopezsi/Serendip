show me a place that ain't hell if there's space give me room to breathe that's all that i need for this body can't fail and if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it let it all out please let me out of here and i shall rise from the ashes grow like a rose from the ruins there must be light in the darkness hope at the end of the night yes i've been tryin all my life to get to heaven but awoke in the eye of the storm but i shall rise from the ashes grow from the ruins and return back home this is a call from the goals coming up to the prisoners of pleasure drunk on the blood of the next generations and i've been through many strange confusions splitting myself into to many faces now the mirror is broken i can see the worms behind you may well have your ways of triumph you may well have your ways of truth just gimme some room to breathe that's all that i need me and my strange friends we all belong to the grand astral body take my hand and i take you out of here and there's you behind those legendary curtains take my hand before you wither in the crowd and i take you out of here this is the end of the show i don't know was i wrong was i right oh love i don't know i wasn't perfect for sure but now i feel like a new born baby lying in the dew of the morning laughing at the sky like a brave new apollo
