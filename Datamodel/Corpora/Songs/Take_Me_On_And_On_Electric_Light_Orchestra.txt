the stars that shine so brightly they call to me i dream of how it might be somewhere far away take me on and on until the world has gone take me on and on the chains that hold you those chains will soon be gone sail upon the ocean sail back to me take me on and on until the world has gone take me on and on take me on on and on i see it all below i know which way to go i see the afterglow take me on and on until the world has gone take me on and on
