i never saw a single tear if she cried it would never show maybe she was lonely i didn't take the time to know i never thought i'd see the day i'd miss her like i do until the day i saw her from a stranger's point of view she never even noticed me if she did she wouldn't say but she never looked so lovely as when she turned and walked away now someone else is holdin her just like i used to do i can see it all so clearly now from a stranger's point of view this stranger's eyes can't take the pain of seeing her like this this stranger's eyes can't overlook everything i missed i never thought i'd see the day i'd miss her like i do until the day i looked at her from a stranger's point of view
