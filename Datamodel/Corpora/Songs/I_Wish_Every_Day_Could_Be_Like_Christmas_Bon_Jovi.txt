what time is it baby is it that time again when snow will be falling friends will be calling you know it's time when there'll be carolers singing silent night i love when they sing the feeling it brings it's warm as a fire is bright soon there'll be toys for the good girls and boys and reindeer are heading our way yes and santa will come down the chimney above there's one thing i wanted to say i wish everyday could be like christmas and if i could have one wish come true i wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony i wish everyday could be like christmas i do i saw a child sit with old mr claus looked him in the eye and he asked old santa what peace on earth was now the old man grew cautious on how he would say that is the greatest gift one you can give everyday i wish everyday could be like christmas and if i could have one wish come true i wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony i wish everyday could be like christmas i do now the mistle-toe and the house a-glow all the world seems at ease tonight and all that i ask when these precious moments pass is why can't every day be so bright i wish everyday could be like christmas and if i could have one wish come true i wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony i wish everyday could be like christmas i do honest i do yes i do now very merry christmas
