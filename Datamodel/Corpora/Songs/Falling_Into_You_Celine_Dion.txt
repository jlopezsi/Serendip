and in your eyes i see ribbons of color i see us inside of each other i feel my unconscious merge with yours and i hear a voice say what's his is hers i'm falling into you this dream could come true and it feels so good falling into you i was afraid to let you in here now i have learned love can't be made in fear the walls begin to tumble down and i can't even see the ground i'm falling into you this dream could come true and it feels so good falling into you falling like a leaf falling like a star finding a belief falling where you are catch me don't let me drop love me don't ever stop so close your eyes and let me kiss you and while you sleep i will miss you i'm falling into you this dream could come true and it feels so good falling into you falling like a leaf falling like a star finding a belief falling where you are falling into you falling into you falling into you
