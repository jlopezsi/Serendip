don't talk of stars burning above if you're in love show me tell me no dreams filled with desire if you're on fire show me here we are together in the middle of the night don't talk of spring just hold me tight anyone whose ever been in love will tell you that this is no time for a chat haven't your lips longed for my touch don't say how much show me show me don't talk of love lasting through time make me no undying vow show me show me haven't your lips longed for my touch don't say how much show me show me don't talk of love lasting through time make me no undying vow show me show me now
