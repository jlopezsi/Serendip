what are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this strong true love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on let's go home before our weakness gets too strong long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold if we live our past in the present our future will be gone let's go home before our weakness gets too strong fiddle line with temptation we raced into the past on a road too small to let the past and the present pass are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone let's go home before our weakness gets too strong long ago we let the flame let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
