i wish somebody would empty my head i am so sorry for the things that i've said this hopeless feeling that's living inside i'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find some peace of mind i ain't no hero who's gonna save you i just say hi as i'm passing right through i ain't that crazy i'm only here for the ride so please forgive me while i'm trying to find some peace of mind read in between the lines truth that is neither black nor white black nor white just give me something real broken man still searching for the light in the night caught in the middle as the front line falls it looks like i don't stand a chance if only i could turn my life around or is this just the circumstance
