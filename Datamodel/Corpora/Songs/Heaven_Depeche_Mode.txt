sometimes i slide away silently i slowly lose myself over and over take comfort in my skin endlessly surrender to my will forever and ever i dissolve in trust i will sing with joy i will end up dust i'm in heaven i stand in golden rays radiantly i burn a fire of love over and over reflecting endless light relentlessly i have embraced the flame forever and ever i will scream the word jump into the void i will guide the world up to heaven
