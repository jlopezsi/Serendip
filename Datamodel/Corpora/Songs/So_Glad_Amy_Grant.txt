i had laid some mighty plans thought i held them in my hands then my world began to crumble all away i tried to build it back again i couldn't bear to see it end how i hurt to know you wanted it that way chorus and i'm so glad glad to find the reason that i'm happy-sad that you've torn it all away and i'm so glad though it hurts to know i'm leaving everything i ever thought that i would be once i held it in my hand it was a kingdom made of sand but now you've blown it all away i can't believe that i can say that i'm glad long before my plans were made i know a master plan was laid with a power that superceded my control and if that truth could pierce my heart i wouldn't wander from the start trying desperately to make it on my own chorus
