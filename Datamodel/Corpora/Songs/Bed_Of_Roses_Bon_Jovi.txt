sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano trying hard to capture the moment this morning i don't know cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head and some blond gave me nightmares i think she is still in my bed as i dream about movies they won't make of me when i'm dead with an ironclad fist i wake up and french kiss the morning while some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking about all of the things that i long to believe about love and the truth and what you mean to me and the truth is baby you're all that i need i want to lay you down on a bed of roses for tonight i sleep on a bed on nails i want to be just as close as the holy ghost is and lay you down on bed of roses well i'm so far away that each step that i take is on my way home a king's ransom in dimes i'd given each night just to see through this payphone still i run out of time or it's hard to get through till the bird on the wire flies me back to you i'll just close my eyes and whisper baby blind love is true i want to lay you down on a bed of roses for tonight i sleep on a bed on nails i want to be just as close as the holy ghost is and lay you down on bed of roses the hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry the barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye i might have said yeah but i laughed so hard i think i died when you close your eyes know i'll be thinking about you while my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again tonight i won't be alone but you know that don't mean i'm not lonely i've got nothing to prove for it's you that i'd die to defend i want to lay you down on a bed of roses for tonight i sleep on a bed on nails i want to be just as close as the holy ghost is and lay you down on bed of roses
