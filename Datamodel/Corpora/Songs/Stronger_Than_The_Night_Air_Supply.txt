tonight you are the world to me part of the mystery and we don't need a reason to love say you'll never go that's all i need to know and when you close your eyes i'll still be here and if the world falls you will be the only reason to love i'll find my way one heart may lie one kiss may die but we live live and learn to fly beyond the darkest sky stronger than the night if you hold me now all that i feel is yours cause you're the only reason to love what you are to me is all that you need to be and when you touch the stars i will be there and when the world falls away i will be your only reason to love i'll find my way one heart may lie one kiss may die but we live live and learn to fly beyond the darkest sky stronger than the night one heart may lie one kiss may die but we live live and learn to fly beyond the darkest sky stronger than the night
