the night we met the night that i won't forget you've seen what i've been waiting for but baby i've been wrong before you held me tight and everything seemed just right i couldn't ask for more but baby i've been wrong before she used to smile at me and hold my hand like you do then she left me and broke my heart in two see her face and feel your warm embrace you're all that i adore but baby i've been wrong before oh baby i've been wrong before
