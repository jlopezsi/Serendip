sambora woke up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night seems like a lifetime when youre wondering whos wrong or right one confession would resurrect the truth revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you now we dance with the devil down lonely street lonely street looking for a window in the house of tears living in hell i pray the rain disappears i'm headed for a breakdown and the fever runs higher as i kneel at the altar i can feel your fire in the church of desire church of desire you never find a reason why love falls from grace some kind of voodoo like a spirit you can't embrace theres a voice in the mirror and a ghost in my heart that relives the passion before we were torn apart now we dance with the devil down lonely street lonely street looking for a window in the house of tears living in hell i pray the rain disappears i'm headed for a breakdown and the fever runs higher as i kneel at the altar i can feel your fire in the church of desire church of desire now we dance with the devil down lonely street lonely street looking for a window in the house of tears living in hell i pray the rain disappears i'm headed for a breakdown and the fever runs higher as i kneel at the altar i can feel your fire in the church of desire church of desire
