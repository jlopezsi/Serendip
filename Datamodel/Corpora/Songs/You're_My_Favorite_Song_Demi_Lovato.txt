words don't come easy without a melody i'm always thinking in terms of do-re-mi i should be hiking swimming laughing with you instead i'm all out of tune but what you don't know you lift me off the ground you're inspiration you helped me find myself just like a baseline in half-time you hold down the groove that's why i'm counting on you and if i heard you on the radio i'd never wanna change a single note it's what i'm trying to say all along you're my favorite song i'm in a session writing tracks you've got another class to teach and then rehearsal with a band you're always one step out of reach i'm looking for some harmony with you it comes so naturally you helped me find the right key and when i hear you on the radio i'd never wanna change a single note it's what i tried to say all along you're my favorite song my favorite song and when i hear you on the radio yeah yeah i'd never wanna change a single note no no it's what i tried to say all along you're my favorite song you're my favorite song
