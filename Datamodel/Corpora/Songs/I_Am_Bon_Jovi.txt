how you spend your minutes are what matters all tomorrows come from yesterdays when you're feeling broken bruised and sometimes shattered blow out the candles on the cake like everything's a big mistake it seems you always wait for life to happen and your last buck can't buy a lucky break if all we've got is us then life's worth living and if you're in you know i'm in i'm ready and i'm willing i am when you think that no one needs you sees you or believes you no one's there to understand i am i'll be there to be that someone when you think that no one is there to hold your hand i am we're just who we are there's no pretending it takes a while to learn to live in your own skin say a prayer that we might find our happy ending and if you're in you know i'm in i'm ready and i'm willing chorus i am when you think that no one needs you sees you or believes you no one's there to understand i am i'll be there to be that someone when you think that no one is there to hold your hand i am i ain't got no halo hanging over my head i ain't gonna judge you i'm just here to love you i am i am chorus i am when you think that no one needs you sees you or believes you no one's there to understand i am i'll be there to be that someone when you think that no one is there to hold your hand i am when you think that no one needs you sees you or believes you no one's there to understand i am i'll be there to be that someone when you think that no one is there to hold your hand i am i am i am
