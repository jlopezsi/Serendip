don't know why there's no sun up in the sky stormy weather since my man and i ain't together keeps rainin all the time life is bare gloom and misery everywhere stormy weather just can't get my poor self together i'm weary all the time so weary all the time when he went away the blues walked in and met me if he stays away old rockin chair will get me all i do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more can't go on every thing i had is gone stormy weather since my man and i ain't together keeps rainin all the time
