memories is all that's left behind as i lay and wait to die little do they know that i hear their choice of life end it now it is the only way too cruel that is what they say release me from this lonely world there is no hope why don't you pull the plug let me pass away pull the plug don't want to life this way once i had full control of my life i now behold a machine decides my fate end it now it's all to late what has now been days it seems like years to stay like this is what i fear life ends so fast so take your chance and make it last end it now it is the only way too cruel that is what they say release me from this lonely world there is no hope why don't you pull the plug let me pass away pull the plug don't want to life this way
