the blue of blue is mostly grey ain't no silver line no brighter day last of the coming up didn't come my way looks like i'm down here to stay down to stay so kick me i won't feel a thing my senses have all been run and there's nothing left of the used to be but the weeping that's just begun that sour taste too late but now i duck my head and no cradle rocks this empty bed if crying's not good for me then i guess i'm doing wrong so i sing this crying song cry along you packed it in too soon you lose me but not your nerve well i guess i know it's what i deserve crazy to think that i could keep you on reserve and so the curtain falls curtain falls
