i read the paper just the other day about a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave they say he went in his sleep with a smile on his face bet he was dreaming bout better days when the crash of the drums hit like waves on a beach that cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams we were searching for a savior like anybody else trying to save ourselves from ourselves just a garage band we weren't alive we were livin in garageland our parents all held jobs but we had other plans we acted like our heroes they just didn't understand and we were never afraid to fall it was us and those four walls just a garage band we weren't alive we were livin in garageland nothing ever felt so right just us those guitars and a saturday night cause with a strap on your back you have wings on your feet you felt like a king when you walked down the street we heard those old records and knew we belonged when the drums hit the groove we'd all sing along just a garage band oh we were livin in garageland just a garage band oh we weren't alive we were livin in garageland nothing ever felt so right it was us those guitars and a saturday night
