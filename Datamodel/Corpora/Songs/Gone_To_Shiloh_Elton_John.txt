luther left us first light friday morning little dan and becky waved goodbye they're gonna have to share the weight together idle hands will see a good farm slowly die gone to shiloh for the union shoulder to shoulder side by side gone to shiloh hope springs eternal when flags and bullets start to fly april's come and the air smells fresh with rain they watched his shadow fade around the bend he's headed for a different kind of thunder and the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men gone to shiloh for the union shoulder to shoulder side by side gone to shiloh time passes slowly when flags and bullets start to fly the old black rooster sang him down that dirt road his step seemed bold his manner fancy-free i pray we see him alive and well in the fall here than that god-forsaken place in tennessee gone to shiloh for the union shoulder to shoulder side by side gone to shiloh men stand united when flags and bullets start to fly after all of this if we should prevail heaven help the south when sherman comes their way
