i am cryin in one eye over you while the other searches for someone new if you do me wrong i'll be gone cause my other eye would tell me to roam cryin in one eye over you the other feels for the one that's blue if you love me like you say you do i'll turn my other eye on you my one eye is shy the other weepin cause i cry for you in my sleepin that's no fib as you will know my other eye will soon start to flow my love for you is very strong it's my fault if i'm all alone to love you and leave you is so wrong i'll be cryin in both eyes from now on
