must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man you have danced with him since the music began won't you change partners and dance with me must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face can't you see i'm longing to be in his place won't you change partners and dance with me ask him to sit this one out while you're alone i'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone you've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when won't you change partners and then you may never want to change partners again
