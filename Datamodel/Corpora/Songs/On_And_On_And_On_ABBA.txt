i was at a party and this feller said to me something bad is happening i'm sure you do agree people care for nothing no respect for human rights evil times are coming we are in for darker nights i said who are you to talk about impending doom he got kinda wary as he looked around the room he said i'm a minister a big shot in the state i said i just can't believe it boy i think it's great brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong he said keep on rocking baby til the night is gone on and on and on keep on rocking baby til the night is gone over in the corner i could see this other guy he was kinda flirty he was giving me the eye so i took advantage of the fact that i'm a star shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar and as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me he said who am i and who are you and who are we what's our situation do we have some time for us i said i was not exactly waiting for the bus he said if you're going somewhere can i come along i said keep on rocking baby til the night is gone on and on and on keep on rocking baby til the night is gone
