i believed in fairy tales in magic spells and wishing wells and pirate sails and once i thought i'd never fall in love that shows how much i knew and i believed in superman in santa claus the world of oz and wonderland but one by one those fantasies have failed while you keep shining through i still believe in you chorus i could never doubt your kiss no other love fills me like this if you take a chance you'll see i believe in you believe in me but one by one those fantasies have failed while you keep shining through and i still believe in you chorus other dreams may turn to dust but i don't care if you'll be there i'll always trust cause i believe in all my heart and soul this dream we share is true and i still believe in you
