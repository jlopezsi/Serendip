i used to watch you walk away til the road you take would bend i was the man to turn you on and you knew it after all come tomorrow when i'm all weary you would turn me down again at least that's the way i can remember do it again do it again do it again do it again every little word you told me got home i'm still thinking about them every little secret we could have known and we can't live without them you surely started something you surely gave me something new do it again do it again do it again do it again and i do think about you each now and then and each time it gets tighter from the road i can see the last break and my head's getting lighter do it again do it again repeat
