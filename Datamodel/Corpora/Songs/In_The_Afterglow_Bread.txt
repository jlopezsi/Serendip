here in the afterglow of what we've done what remains here in the after show of what we've seen is it strange to be falling away now or would you say we should have known it would end this way and both of us turn to dust we went deeper deeper in debt to games and lies we got over our head and never realized how when or why but now as i sit reflecting on your face in my hand now i can see your picture helps retrace all the steps we took places we went to thoughts that we tried tripping along on a love we never understood with no guide many things were taken for granted all along firm foundations never were planted all went wrong we fell down and broke in a million pieces we couldn't put it all together we couldn't put it all together again
