it's a crazy little thing called mad love it goes something like this tangled up in you uh twisted like i've never been before i don't know what you do all i know is i want a little more i don't care if the way that i act doesn't make much sense when you're near something in me reacts and there's no defense i don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real all that matters is how this feels i'm falling deeper so fill up my cup nothing tastes sweeter than mad love i know i should but it's so good i'm never gonna give it up cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love oh i wanna take you in come here a velvet rush is running through mad veins like adrenaline a kiss from you and i'm going so insane i don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real all that matters is how this feels i'm falling deeper so fill up my cup nothing tastes sweeter than my love i know i should but it's so good i'm never gonna give it up cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love i'm falling deeper so fill up my cup nothing tastes sweeter than mad love i know i should but it's so good i'm never gonna give it up cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
