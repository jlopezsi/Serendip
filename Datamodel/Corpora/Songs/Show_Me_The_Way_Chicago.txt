flying so high feeling so low fill my empty heart don't say no can i get through this night with some loving to show won't you show me the way to go i don't know won't you open your eyes i know you really care you see these games you play they're just not fair after all the good times and secrets we've shared won't you show me the way to go i don't know i want to take my place i want to take my place i want to take my place with the loved ones well i still can't see how things were meant to be love me even for one day i'll treat you like a lady in my heart you'll stay forever you know won't you show me the way to go i don't know marching into your heart marching into your heart
