chasing shadows over my walls with myself hardly sleeping dwarfs and giants twenty feet tall fill the room with their creeping sounds of breathing sharpen my ears then they fade into nothing someone's laughter out in the street fills the night with their loving i feel the ice in my head running its hands through my bed not even dreaming i seem to be dead colours of yellow and colours of red all i'm asking some secret voice is to lead me to darkness i'm so tired dawn never comes i just hide in the shadows
