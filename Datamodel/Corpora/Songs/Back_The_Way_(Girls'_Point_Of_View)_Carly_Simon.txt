back the way it was before before the heart was broken playing hookey making cookies we were always jokin back the way it used to be talks didn't end in a quarrel everything seemed so normal back the way it was before but now the limo pulls up to the door and she gets in she calls bye bye honey here is some money i forgot the groceries back the way it was before the chicken pox was easy we told each other everything and nobody was nosey back the way it used to be when we were a happy family nobody ever asked us if we wanted tiny little sandwiches sent up to our room
