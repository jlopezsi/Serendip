let me take you on a trip around the world and back and you won't have to move you just sit still now let your mind do the walking and let my body do the talking let me show you the world in my eyes i'll take you to the highest mountain to the depths of the deepest sea we won't need a map believe me now let my body do the moving and let my hands do the soothing let me show you the world in my eyes that's all there is nothing more than you can feel now that's all there is let me put you on a ship on a long long trip your lips close to my lips all the islands in the ocean all the heaven's in the motion let me show you the world in my eyes that's all there is nothing more than you can touch now that's all there is let me show you the world in my eyes
