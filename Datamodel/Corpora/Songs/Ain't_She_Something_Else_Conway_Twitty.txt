don't you like the way she talks to you when she's feeling woman warm and don't it make you feel so good just to know she's yours all by yourself don't you like to see the sun go down when she's lying close to you and can't you feel her all around and when she loves you ain't she something else chorus ain't she just some kind of lover in the morning can't your arms feel the warmness where she slept ain't she just all that you have ever wanted and when she loves you ain't she something else don't you like the way she clings to you and loves you til there's nothing left now tell me don't her lips taste good and when she loves you ain't she somthing else repeat chorus lord when she loves me she's sure something else
