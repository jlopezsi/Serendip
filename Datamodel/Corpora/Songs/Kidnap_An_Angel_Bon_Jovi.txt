i get up every morning drink coffee alone my house it's too quiet i'm the only one home i let the newspapers pile up at the door i can't be bothered i don't read em no more the flowers are blooming that you planted last spring i can't make much sense out of anything if i could kidnap an angel i'd clip off his wings and bring them to you that would fix everything i get in the car like i do every day wondering how in the world did it turn out this way it's just round the corner turn left and i'm there i'd do anything to be anywhere but here if i could kidnap an angel i'd clip off his wings and bring them to you that would fix everything if i could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly we'd live forever forever we'd never die if i could kidnap an angel now the parking attendant knows my first name these long green hallways all look the same there's four elevators one goes to that floor i brace myself when i get to the door i close my eyes and take a deep breath then sit down beside your hospital bed if i could kidnap an angel i'd clip off his wings and bring them to you that would fix everything if i could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly we'd live forever forever we'd never die if i could kidnap an angel if i could kidnap an angel he'd say the word he'd tear down these walls people laughing like children through these hospital halls there'd be no more tears there'd be no more blood there'd be nothing but smiles nothing but love if i could kidnap an angel if i could kidnap an angel
