have you seen the little pieces of the people we have been little pieces blowing gently on the wind they have flown down california they have landed in l.a little pieces slowly settling on the waves i'm one of a million pieces fallen on the ground it's one of the reasons when we say goodbye we'll still come around we will come around i have waited for tomorrow from december til today i have started loving sorrow along the way i am calling from some city and i won't be there too long i could wait and i could waste away but what comes back is i hear you say we're gone for all of the times that i go spinning up and down when all of the things have died between us well we'll still come around we will come around after i've been missing for a while and you hear that summer's song haven't all the fading lines lingered on what i know is she's going when you know it it's alright so you put yourself between you and your pride if you wait for what's coming and you listen to her lies then she'll say the things you need to hear and the only one who'll disappear is you and one of the million lies she said is all of the things you love are dead but i've seen what she thinks is love and it leaves me laughing so we'll still come around
