the whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight are rolling by like thunder now as i look in your eyes i hold on to your body and feel each move you make your voice is warm and tender a love that i could not forsake cause you are my lady and i'm your man whenever you reach for me i'll do all that i can lost is how i'm feeling lying in your arms when the world outside's too much to take that all ends when i'm with you even though there may be times it seems i'm far away but never wonder where i am cause i am always by your side cause you are my lady and i'm your man whenever you reach for me i'll do all that i can we're heading for something somewhere i've never been sometimes i am frightened but i'm ready to learn bout the power of love the sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly the feeling that i can't go on is light years away cause you are my lady and i'm your man whenever you reach for me i'll do all that i can we're heading for something somewhere i've never been sometimes i am frightened but i'm ready to learn bout the power of love
