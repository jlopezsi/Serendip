you only live twice oh so it seems one life for yourself and one for your dreams you drift through the years and life seems stray till one dream appears and love is its way i'd love you to strangers ooh beckon you on don't think of the danger for a stranger is gone this dream is for you so pay the price make one dream come true you only live twice this dream is for you so pay the price make one dream come true you only live twice you only live twice
