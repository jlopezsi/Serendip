longer than ther've been fishes in the ocean higher than any bird ever flew longer than there've been stars up in the heavens i've been in love with you stronger than any mountain cathedral truer than any tree ever grew deeper than any forest primeval i am in love with you i'll bring fire in the winters you'll send showers in the springs we'll fly through the falls and summers with love on our wings through the years as the fire starts to mellow burning lines in the book of our lives though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow i'll be in love with you i'll be in love with you longer than ther've been fishes in the ocean higher than any bird ever flew longer than there've been stars up in the heavens i've been in love with you i am in love with you
