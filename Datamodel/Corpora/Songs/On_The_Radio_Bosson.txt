someone found me a letter you wrote me on the radio and they told the world just how you felt it must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat they never said your name but i know just who they meant woa woa i was so surprised and shocked and wondered too if by chance you heard it for yourself i never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you but they said it really loud they said it on the air chorus on the radio oh oh oh on the radio oh oh oh now now don't it kind of strike you sad when you hear our song things are not the same since we broke up last june the only thing that i want to hear is it that you love me still and that you think you'll be coming home real soon woho yeah it kinda made me feel proud when i heard him say you couldn't find the words to say yourself and now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel cause they said it really loud they said it on the air chorus if you think that love isn't found on on the radio then tune right in you may find the love you lost cause now i'm sitting here with the girl i sent away long ago she finally realized he said it really loud on the radio chorus
