dear when i dance with you we move like the sea you you're all i want to know i feel free i feel free i can walk down the street there's no one there the pavement is one huge crowd i can drive down the road my eyes can't see but my mind wants to cry out loud i can walk down the street there's no one there the pavement is one huge crowd i can drive down the road my eyes can't see but my mind wants to cry out loud my mind wants to cry out loud i feel free dance floor is like the sea the ceiling is the sky you're the sun and as you shine on me i feel free i feel free i feel free
