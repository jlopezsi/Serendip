i am the crazy man who lives inside your head but i think i'm breaking through the wall you are the innocent convicted of the crime no one was ever there to catch you when you fall i see the diamonds but you only see the rock i need to run but you only crawl it's time to open up all the doors that you keep locked nobody gives without a take let's take it all you've been twisted into pieces by the hands of your emotions how much longer are you gonna pay for yesterday sins of the father one more crucifixion one more cross to bear you're a hole in a photograph go on lose it in the city the city can feel no shame see the world with electric eye they call it mystery but any fool could see you thought he walked on the water and if the pain was gone and you were free to run away and get out would you get out of there or do you really care it's not safe or easy and maybe when you're gone you just won't belong at all you're the only witness to the murder of an angel how much longer are you gonna pay for yesterday sins of the father it's just another crucifixion one more cross to bear go on lose it in the city take a look at the world you've got electric eyes
