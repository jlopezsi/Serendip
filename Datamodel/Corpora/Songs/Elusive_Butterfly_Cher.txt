you might wake up some mornin to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind and if you're quick enough to rise you'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow out on the new horizon you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings and if the sleep has left your ears you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow don't be concerned it will not harm you it's only me pursuing somethin i'm not sure of across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love you might have heard my footsteps echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind i might have even called your name as i ran searching after something to believe in you might have seen me runnin through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind if you remember something there that glided past you followed close by heavy breathin don't be concerned it will not harm you it's only me pursuing somethin i'm not sure of across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
