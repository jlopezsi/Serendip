one year two years time goes by people laugh and people cry every morning the clock strikes eight i go to work i close the gate and on my way i sing a song about my wife where i belong if the clouds get together and talk about the weather if it's rain they anticipate baby make no mistake yes the storm will break but never me you see two years on two years on but only you can see me only you can see me for what i've got sir lancelot was just a dream and i am not for i am he with something more it's you and i reality if the cloud get together and talk about the weather if it's rain they anticipate baby make no mistake yes the storm will break but never me you see two years on two years on but only you can see me only you can see me two years on two years on
