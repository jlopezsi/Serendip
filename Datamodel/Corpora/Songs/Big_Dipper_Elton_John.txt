now i saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor and it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure he had a thing about a quarter to four and he just couldn't handle any more he's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper he's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours so you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him and you took him down to the fairground after some action and by around about a quarter to six you found a different way to get your kicks up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks big dipper up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks he hadn't been too keen at the start now he seems to have a change of heart he's got his own big dipper only now he's not so sure big dipper he's got his own big dipper but there's always room for more everybody's got a song to sing everybody's got to do their thing big dipper big dipper and at around about a quarter to ten you got up and did it all again he's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for big dipper he's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours another ride another tune another crazy afternoon another reason for squeezing your big dipper
