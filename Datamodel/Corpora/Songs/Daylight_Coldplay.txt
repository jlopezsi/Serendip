to my surprise and my delight i saw sunrise i saw sunlight i am nothing in the dark and the clouds burst to show daylight ooh and the sun will shine yeah on this heart of mine ooh and i realize who cannot live without ooh come apart without it on a hilltop on a sky-rise like a firstborn child and at full tilt and in full flight defeat darkness breaking daylight ooh and the sun will shine yeah on this heart of mine ooh and i realized who cannot live without ooh and come apart without daylight slowly breaking through daylight slowly breaking through daylight slowly breaking through daylight slowly breaking through daylight x10
