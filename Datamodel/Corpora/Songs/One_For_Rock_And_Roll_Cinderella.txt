i was born on the dawn of a new society and i feel lucky that my eyes could see people standing up and being who they want to be people made the music and the music may them free now i was just a baby through the summer of love they say but it still feels like it was yesterday and if the road gets rough i pick up my guitar and play it's always been right by my side to help me on my way chorus now i don't need to worry bout tomorrow ain't anticipating what's to come and i don't need to worry bout the things i have not done long as i got rock and roll i'm forever young now we can't always understand this world farther along we'll understand it all the 70s looked like we all were headed for a fall but those who listened hard enough could hear the summer call now i was growing up through all of this my first beer and love and my first kiss you never learn the things in school you learn by living and going through you taught me to be myself how can i thank you chorus chorus ain't it truth
