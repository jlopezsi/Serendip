i'm so weary from holding this load but it's only love for you that i walk this lonely road i must follow the wind follow the wind and the wind will take me hold before the cold every stay i have counted each flower i have seen but the place where i'm going there's no grass as green i must follow the wind follow the wind and the wind will take me home where i can dream in the hour i am lonely you're love will be mine i will stay in your arms dear until comes the time i must be on my way for my home is anywhere i have no time to stay i have no time to care i must follow the wind follow the wind as the wind gently blows in my hair i must follow the wind follow the wind as the wind gently blows in my hair i must follow the wind follow the wind as the wind gently blows in my hair
