when we do it the great big it i hope it's we and not just me when we do it something happens and it's bigger than the both of us and for a second there's no trouble and the world outside goes away the clock on the wall between us stops then the world outside blows away you make me lose my body and nothing could be better you make me lose my body it's like we've died and gone to heaven you make me lose my body when we do it the universal it i know it's we and not just me when we do it
