i went to see the preacher to teach me how to pray he looked at me and smiled then the preacher turned away he said if you want to tell him something you ain't gotta fold your hands say it with your heart your soul and believe it and i'd say amen bang a drum for the sinners bang a drum for the sins bang a drum for the losers and those who win bang a drum bang it loudly or as soft as you need bang a drum for yourself son and a drum for me i called upon my brother just the other day he said john i'm gonna die if i don't start to live again i work each day and night like clockwork just trying to make ends meet i could kick this bad world's ass if i could just get on my feet i'd bang a drum for the dying bang a drum for the truth bang a drum for the innocence lost in our youth bang a drum bang it loudly or as soft as you need bang a drum for you brother and a drum for me i don't know where all the rivers run i don't know how far i don't know how come but i'm gonna die believin each step that i take ain't worth the ground that i walk on if we don't walk it our own way no i don't claim to be a wise man a poet or a saint i'm just another man who's searching for a better way but my heart beats loud as thunder for the things that i believe sometimes i wanna run for cover sometimes i want to scream bang a drum for tomorrow bang a drum for the past bang a drum for the heroes that won't come back bang a drum for the promise bang a drum for the lies bang a drum for the lovers and the tears they've cried bang a drum bang it loudly or as soft as you need but as long as my heart keeps on bangin i got a reason to believe
