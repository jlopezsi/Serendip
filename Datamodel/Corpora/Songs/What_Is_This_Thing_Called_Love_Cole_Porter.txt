i was a humdrum person leading a life apart when love flew in through my window wide and quickened my hum-drum heart love flew in through my window i was so happy then but after love had stayed a little while love flew out again what is this thing called love this funny thing called love just who can solve its mystery why should it make a fool of me i saw you there one wonderful day you took my heart and threw it away that's why i ask the lord in heaven above what is this thing called love you gave me days of sunshine you gave me nights of cheer you made my life an enchanted dream til somebody else came near somebody else came near you i felt the winter's chill and now i sit and wonder night and day why i love you still
