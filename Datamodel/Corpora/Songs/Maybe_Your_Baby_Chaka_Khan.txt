i'm feeling down in some kinda lonely cuz my baby done left me here hearts blazing like a five alarm fire and i don't even give a care i feel like the world is fallin dreams to ashes right in front of my face i'm gettin kind of worried and i feel so out of place chorus maybe my baby done made some other plans maybe my baby done made some other plans in the morning when i get a heartache i can't call on the doctor for help cuz the only person that could ever do me any good is runnin around with my best friend oh i feel like i'm slippin deeper lower a little deeper into myself i tell you that i just can't handle it you all it's scaring me to death chorus maybe my baby done made some other plans maybe my baby done made some other plans repeat chorus
