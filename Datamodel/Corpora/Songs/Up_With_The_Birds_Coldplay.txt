the birds they sang at break of day start again i hear them say it's so hard to just walk away the birds they sang all a choir start again a little higher it's a spark in a sea of gray the sky is blue dream that lie till it's true then taken back the punch i threw my arms turn in oh those clumsy things send me up to that wonderful world and then i'm up with the birds might have to go where they don't know my name float all over the world just to see her again and i won't show or feel any pain even though all my armor might rust in the rain a simple plot but i know one day good things are coming our way a simple plot but i know one day good things are coming our way oh yeah
