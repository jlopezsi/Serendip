shall i wear a buttonhole to jog your memory so you'll recall the promise that i swore you made to me when we were younger you look sorry for yourself but what about i'm some idea you're not without a doubt so you can put away that tongue i don't know who i'm trying to kid i'll find another name for you i'll try to put the blame on you for everything we did life shrinks and before you know it you have forgotten all the cuts and bruises just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons and you know by now who loses you're only half awake because you never go to bed and when he hears about it you know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise you'll be sorry because i won't tell you again you'll stick like that one day and if you don't believe me go and ask st thomas i don't know where it's going to stop spend your whole time trying to stay from breaking down or running away or trying to keep up
