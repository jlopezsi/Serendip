heaven i'm in heaven and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak and i seem to find the happiness i seek when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek heaven i'm in heaven and the cares that hung around me through the week seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to climb a mountain and to reach the highest peak but it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to go out fishing in a river or a creek but i don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek dance with me i want my arms about you the charm about you will carry me through to heaven i'm in heaven and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak and i seem to find the happiness i seek when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to climb a mountain and to reach the highest peak but it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to go out fishing in a river or a creek but i don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek dance with me i want my arms about you the charm about you will carry me through to heaven i'm in heaven and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak and i seem to find the happiness i seek when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
