i love to see you oh my love i want to feel you near my need is deep inside well i've been rolling on i've been holding on i'd like you to know that it's been a long long time sometimes it's hard to make it through the day sometimes it's hard to find my way sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days when your friends have all gone leaving this town for another one the night is coming round i can feel the weight of coming down so afraid to lose this dream i want you to understand that i'm trying to do the best i can it's so easy to lose my way lay your head where you may find some peace i've been searching for my happiness don't you want to wake up and take my love i'd be happy if you'd let me know should i stay or go let me know woke from a dream to see reflections all around me of new realities heavenly angels won't you guide me please help me to decide the path most meant for me
