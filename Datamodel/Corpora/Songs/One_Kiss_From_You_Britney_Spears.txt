i'm dreaming of one kiss from you a love long and true we'll go on and on and i don't want to hear that i'm too young to know it's love that makes me feel this way cause i don't have to feel the heat of the sun to know it's shining on me every day when it's warm outside and the look in your eyes is longing to show me the way i don't want to wait chorus just one kiss from you and suddenly i see the road laid out in front of me you give me strength you give me hope and when you hold me in your arms you make me whole and i don't know just what i would do without one kiss from you i don't want to hear my time will come when it feels like it's already here we should learn to walk before we run but why go anywhere when you're so near cause when i reach out to you so sad and confused and feeling like i could cry you dry my eyes chorus i'm dreaming of one kiss from you a love long and true we'll go on and on and i'm looking for one kiss goodnight to last all my life on and on and chorus i'm looking for one kiss goodnight to last all my life
