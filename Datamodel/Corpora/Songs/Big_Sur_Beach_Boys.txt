do do do do do do do do do cashmere hills filled with evergreens flowin from the clouds down to meet the sea with the granite cliff big sur mount as a referee crimson sunsets and golden dawns a mother deer with their newborn fawns all under big sur skies big sur mount that's where i belong big sur i've got plans for you me and mine are going to add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers big sur mount and live in canyons covered in springtime green wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen and with my old guitar i'll make up songs to sing where bubbling springs from the mountainside join the big sur river to the oceanside where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide big sur my astrology it says that i am made to be where the rugged mountain meets the water and so while stars shine brightly from up above the fog rolls in through a redwood grove and to my dying fire i think i'll add a log from time to time i must go away the thoughts of big sur won't let me stay away from big sur oh big sur
