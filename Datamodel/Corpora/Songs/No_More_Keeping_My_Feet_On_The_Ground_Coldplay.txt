sometimes i wake up when i'm falling asleep i think that maybe the curtains are closing on me but i wake up yes i wake up smiling chorus so what i feel fine i'm okay i've seen the lighter side of life i'm alright i feel good so ill go ill try to start moving sometimes i wake up and i'm falling asleep but i've got to get going so much that i wanted to do but i wake up smiling and this could be my last chance of saving my innocence and this could be my last chance no more keeping my feet on the ground sometimes i feel the chance is surprising surprisingly good to be moving around and i move and i wake up smiling chorus and this could be my last chance of saving my innocence and this could be my last chance no more keeping my feet on the ground and there's nothing to keep them nothing to keep them down and there's nothing to keep them there's nothing to keep them down
