this won't be easy you'll think it's strange when i try to explain how i feel that i still need your love after all that i've done you won't believe me all you will see is a girl you once knew although she's dressed up to nines for sixes and sevens with you i had to let it happen i had to change couldn't stay all my life down at heel looking out of the window staying out of the sun so i choose freedom running around trying everything new but nothing impressed me at all i never expected it too don't cry for me argentina the truth is i never left you all through my wild days my mad existence i kept my promise don't keep your distance and as for fortune and as for fame i never invited them in though it appeared to the world they were all i desired they are illusions they're not the solutions they promised to be the answer was here all the time i love you and hope you love me don't cry for me argentina the truth is i never left you all through my wild days my mad existence i kept my promise don't keep your distance i kept my promise don't keep your distance
