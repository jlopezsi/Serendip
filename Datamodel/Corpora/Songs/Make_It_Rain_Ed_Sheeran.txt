verse 1 when the sins of my father weigh down in my soul and the pain of my mother will not let me go well i know there can come fire from the sky to refine the purest of kings and even though i know this fire brings me pain even so and just the same chorus x2 make it rain make it rain down lord make it rain oh make it rain verse 2 well a seed needs the water before it grows out of the ground but it just keeps on getting hard hunger more profound well i know they can't count tears from the eye but they may as well be in vain and even though i know these tears come with pain even so and just the same chorus x2 verse 3 the seas are full of water stops by the shore it's like the riches of grandeur never reach the poor and let the clouds fill with thunderous applause and let lightning be the veins and fill the sky with all that they can draw when it's time to make a change chorus x4
