i love i love oh i still love you can't wait to see the firelight in your eyes that's why i wait for your footsteps in the snow i dream each night that i will wake to find you sleeping deep and still down by my side that's why i wait for your footprints in the snow time after time year after year forever i will love you in deepest winter darkest hours you'll find me at midnight silence tremble at the glow that's why i wait for your footprints in the snow
