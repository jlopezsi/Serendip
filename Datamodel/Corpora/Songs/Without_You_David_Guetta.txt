i can't win i can't reign i will never win this game without you without you i am lost i am vain i will never be the same without you without you i won't run i won't fly i will never make it by without you without you i can't rest i can't fight all i need is you and i without you without you chorus oh oh oh you you you without you you you without you can't erase so i'll take blame but i can't accept that we're estranged without you without you i can't quit now this can't be right i can't take one more sleepless night without you without you i won't soar i won't climb if you're not here i'm paralyzed without you without you i can't look i'm so blind i lost my heart i lost my mind without you without you chorus i am lost i am vain i will never be the same without you without you without you
