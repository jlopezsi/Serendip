sunday finds me curled in bed i can hear the sally army in the old town square i can hear their brass and chorus's they fill the air and i wonder why they do it when there's no-one ever there moments later out of bed goes me and i'm gazing out the window in the morning light and the lasses in their bonnets makes a pretty sight and i thought if that's an army it's a funny way to fight but its an empty life if you've got no purpose and your lost and feel your on your own and if i told my work mates they'd have said i'd gone barmy when i ran down the stair to join the salvation army oh it was love that i could depend upon and all of my emptiness had gone babababbababababa oh it's an empty life if you've got no purpose and your lost and feel your on your own if i told my work mates they'd have said i'd gone barmy when i ran down the stair to join the salvation army oh it was love that i could depend upon and all of my emptiness had gone some years later looking back at me i believe i've found the answer and i'd like to say you've need never be alone when god's a prayer away and he'll fill you with his sunshine if your life is cold and grey
