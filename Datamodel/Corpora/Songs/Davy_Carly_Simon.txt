davy is there a song out there in the night for us davy is there the kind of smile that you read about there are ghosts who would warn me keep me alone davy are you the heat i feel in my foolish heart davy there's not a day that i haven't prayed to feel something so worthy for someone like you davy could there be love so bright like to jump off the sea davy did i imagine it or did you look at me with a look so bold that i had to look away but if it feels alright if it feels alright and it feels alright davy davy davy
