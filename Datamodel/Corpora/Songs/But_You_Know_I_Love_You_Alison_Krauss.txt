when the morning sun streaks across my room and i'm waken up from another dream of you when i'm on the road once again it seems all that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you how i wish that love was all we need to live what a life we'd have cause i've got so much to give but it seems so wrong deep inside my heart that the dollar sign should be keeping us apart but you know i love yes i love you ohhh i love you and if only i could find my way back to the time when the problems of this life it did not cross your minds and all the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes and i'd come running back to you i'd come running back to you but you know we can't live on dreams alone and to pay the rent i must leave you all alone and though i made my choice many years ago and now this traveling life is the only one i know but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you
