nightand the world is fast asleep i will hold you here and keep all our secret dreams and plans younever thought our love could last now you've put that in the past cause you finally understand that after all the times you told me that we'd never be good together after all the things you said that made me think that you'd never call now you've turned around and told me that you want to stay here forever and you're back here in my arms where you belong after all weall the promises we made all the words we never said never knowing what was right you didn't knowthat the love we used to share wasn't cause it wasn't there we'll make up for it tonight that after all the times you told me that we'd never be good together after all the things you said that made me think that you'd never call now you've turned around and told me that you want to stay here forever and you're back here in my arms where you belong after all we were young and your dreams took you places far from me i was wrong to believe that you'd go cause here you are that after all the times you told me that we'd never be good together after all the things you said that made me think that you'd never call now you've turned around and told me that you want to stay here forever and you're back here in my arms where you belong after all
