i was thinking about miracles when you were fast asleep of all the things we tried to find it's only love we keep and i don't ever want to wake you your dreams are taking you so far it's there that i can always touch you for love is where you are chorus fall upon me take love from me nothing is more beautiful to see walk beside me grow inside me all i have you gave to me each day another miracle that time can never take if time should come to claim you now he knows it's much too late so let the gates of dawn fly open and cast your light for all to see the chains of morning now are broken and you are drifting into me chorus x2
