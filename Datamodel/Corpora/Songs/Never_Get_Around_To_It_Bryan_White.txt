still got your picture up on the wall i can't take em down i keep expecting you to call but you don't make a sound time ain't supposed to pass this slow i should have forgotten you long ago i just never get around to getting over you i'm tired of putting it off till tomorrow should've done it yesterday no gain in drowning in my sorrow and just wasting away just when i think i got it made you never fail to get in the way i just never get around to getting over you bridge if i could just convince myself to open my eyes and see you're not the one for me then i could start all over and get on with my life and be free from your memory i could be free you see you're still here after all this time and i can't erase you from my mind i just never get around never get around baby never get around to getting over you
