as close as the sea is to the seashore tide still rises twice a day that's just the ocean's way of getting closer closer as close as today is to tomorrow at midnight they can finally touch cause every minute brings them that much closer closer so on this silent night i call your name and suddenly all time and space disappears i see your face in firelight i hold you close in memory and even though you're gone i know you're here as close as the glow is to the ember you've always been a part of me now living in my heart you're even closer closer i see your face in firelight i hold you close in memory and even though i know you're gone i know you're here as sure as there's snowfall in december your love lives in everything summer winter fall or spring every thought of you will bring us closer the distance may be large or small someday i pray that we may all be closer closer
