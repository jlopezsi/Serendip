i was born in the shadows under the iberian sun i was the dawn of the valley under the iberian sun i once was a sinner but who was not i really liked to rumble and hustle a lot but where is the key monster he is not here i am just a gatekeeper now so sincere now so sincere now so sincere who am i what is the purpose who am i and where do i flee who am i i'd like to remember who am i and who do i want to be who do i want to be who am i and who do i want to be i went down to the river trying to find peace in my mind in the throw i saw you glimmer the desire for you made me blind i first saw you at the distance when the moon's at its height i came to get to know you a disclosure so bright i knew in my heart when your flair made me swoon i am just a prisoner in search of my tune who am i what is the purpose who am i from where do i flee who am i i'd like to remember who am i and who do i want to be
