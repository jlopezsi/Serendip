once she came into my room feathered hat an all wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders two eyes like lights milky marble whites looking up at me looking for a way moons in an endless day all i knew was with her then no couldn't see the time as we drank down the wine to the last sweet scarlet how was i to wonder why or even question this underneath her her kiss i was so unguarded every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone ah but the song carries on so holy she was so much younger then wild like the wind a gypsy with a grin from and old far away country but deep beneath her curls beneath this misty pearl there was more to see she could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife she cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted all those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone ah but the song carries on so holy come let us drink again before the second show i want you so to know there's no bridge between us all those gates have opened now and through the light has shone ah but the song carries on so holy
