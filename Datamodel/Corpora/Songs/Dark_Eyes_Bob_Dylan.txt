oh the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside they're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide i live in another world where life and death are memorized where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all i see are dark eyes a cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer some mother's child has gone astray she can't find him anywhere but i hear another rum beating for the dead that rise whom nature's beast fear as they come and all i see are dark eyes they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes they tell me revenge is sweet i'm sure it is but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes oh the french girl she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel oh time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes
