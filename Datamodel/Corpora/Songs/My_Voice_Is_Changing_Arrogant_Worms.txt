last night when i went to bed with tangled hair upon my head in every way i really was a kid it happened without warning when i woke up in the morning i can't tell you just what happened but it did i grew six inches in one day it's painful when it goes that way and now my skinny body's really achin and my skin just exploded with an inch of oil it's loaded it's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon my voice is changing out of thin air and body parts that once were smooth are growing bits of hair my voice is changing what does it mean i guess i'll be a real man before i turn 13 i buy two pairs of jeans a week i'm such a tall and awkward geek i fall down when i try to play a grounder at dinner every night i eat a giant heaping plate of meat then go out with my friends for quarter pounders and weird emotions come alive my hormones are in overdrive i've turned into a girl-watching creature and all my friends their marks are shot but they don't care because they're hot for mrs smith the mathematics teacher my voice is changing i hate to hear it crack i pray to god i won't inherit dad's hairy back my voice is changing when will it end and when will mom stop kissing me in front of all my friends pretty soon i bet i'll be right into heavy metal but my parents say at least it isn't rap i'll start wearing stupid clothes and threaten that i'll pierce my nose and tell my parents all they like is crap the first girl that i ever kiss will be the one and who could miss our love forever written in the stars but i don't think our love will last unless the four years go by fast till i can use the backseat of the car my voice is changing out of thin air and body parts that once were smooth are growing bits of hair my voice is changing what does it mean i guess i'll be a real man before i turn 13 my voice is changing i hate to hear it crack i pray to god i won't inherit dad's hairy back my voice is changing when will it end and when will mom stop kissing me in front of all my friends cha-cha-cha
