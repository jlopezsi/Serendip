paul stookey 1963 and it came to pass on a christmas evening while all the doors were shuttered tight outside standing lonely boy-child cold and shivering in the night on the street every window save but one was gleaming bright and to this window walked the boy-child peeking in saw candle light through other windows he had looked at turkeys ducks and geese cherry pies but through this window saw a grey-haired lady table bare and tears in her eyes into his coat reached the boy-child knowing well there was little there he took from his pocket his own christmas dinner a bit of cheese some bread to share his outstretched hands held the food and they trembled as the door it opened wide said he would you share with me christmas dinner gently said she come inside the grey-haired lady brought forth to the table glasses two and her last drop of wine said she here's a toast to everyone's christmas and especially yours and mine and it came to pass on that christmas evening while all the doors were shuttered tight that in that town the happiest christmas was shared by candle light
