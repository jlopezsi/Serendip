the autumn evenings filled with copper shades i see the birds neck in the frame a figure walks into the sunset someone goes past suspended from the sky takes more imagination when everything's remote control for me it's just a case of what's on the far side of the road tell everybody i'm going away for ten years i'm going to wander among the wicklow hills the travelling children in their sunday clothes lost on the corner of the street fat gypsy lady smacks the windowpane a farm dog gets out on the motorway takes more imagination when everything's remote control for me it's just a case of what's on the far side of the road tell everybody i'm going away for ten years i'm going to wander among the wicklow hills
