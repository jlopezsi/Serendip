when i saw your face i could feel my heartbeat begin to race in the still of the night it was love at first sight not too long ago i was on my own never would have known you'd come into my life now you're the love of my life chorus once in a lifetime maybe the last time just the right time to fall in love once in a lifetime for such a long time i've been waiting for you you were there for me it was there for you we were meant to be now we're fallin in love finally fallin in love chorus
