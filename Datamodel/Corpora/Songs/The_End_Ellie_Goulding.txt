we've only ever kissed lying down we've only ever touched when there's no one else around i can be elusive if you want me to i'm not being intrusive i just wish i knew the truth as to why i wait for you longer than the average person would and why i think about you more than i think one should our bodies fit together like a make-shift puzzle and it's clear to see why you puzzle me and you turn your frame and you whisper my name as though i am a burden cause i'm making up for lost time and i'm making up for you and i'm waking up from last night and i'm waking up with you so what's new so what's new i am at your house so i belong to you for now trying to impress you but lord i don't know how i can be a statue if you want me to i'm not being difficult i just need to know the truth as to why i'm wanting you and i would take you if i could and why i'm still lay here it's something i still haven't understood our hands rest together like pieces of paper but they're always blank when i hold your hand and it gave you a fright when i stayed the night and you gave yourself to me cause i'm making up for lost time and i'm making up for you and i'm waking up from last night and i'm waking up with you so what's new so what's new it's not the end it's not the end so don't lets pretend cause i'm making up for lost time and i'm making up for you and i'm waking up from last night and i'm making up for you so what's new so what's new so what's new
