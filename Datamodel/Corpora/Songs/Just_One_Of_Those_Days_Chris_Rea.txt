cold red sunsets that freeze the rainbows out standing here in the rain i've been thinking how how much happier i have been since you came staring down at the sidewalk shining satin winds floating down change the crystals on ladies faces i think i'll stick around laden gutters flowing over hit the streets and explode young girls laughing and make up streaming go running down the road i've been thinking and too much drinking and things i just don't dare to say it's still raining but who's complaining it's just one of those days
