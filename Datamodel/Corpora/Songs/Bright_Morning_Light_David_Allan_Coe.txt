she was a waitress in a west texas dance hall i was a cowboy with a throat full of sand i called her honey when she brought my whiskey and later i left there holding her hand then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel where she had a room on a cold second floor and that room looked like hell just a bed and a table a shade on the window and a lock on the door i said to myself she's cheap and she's easy but she don't look half bad i'll stay for the night but i'll leave when it's early cause i've got this feeling she won't look so good in the bright morning light harmonica i've known some devils and i've known some angels i once had a woman on the mexico line but i've never been touched like that woman touched me she lay there beside me and crawled in my mind and we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin the sun come a streamin through a hole in the shade and it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body and it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay i said to myself she's cheap and she's easy but she don't look half bad i guess i'll stay for the night but i'll tell you boys that was five years ago and lord god what a woman she still looks as good in the bright morning light
