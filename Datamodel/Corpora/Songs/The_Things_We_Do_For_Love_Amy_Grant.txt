too many broken hearts have fallen in the river too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea you lay your bets and then you pay the price the things we do for love the things we do for love communication is the problem to the answer you've got her number and your hand is on the phone the weather's turned and all the lines are down the things we do for love the things we do for love like walking in the rain and the snow when there's nowhere to go and you're feelin like a part of you is dying and you're looking for the answer in his eyes you think you're gonna break up then he says he wants to make up ooh you made me love you ooh you've got a way ooh you had me crawling on the floor like walking in the rain and the snow when there's nowhere to go and you're feelin like a part of you is dying and you're looking for the answer in his eyes you think you're gonna break up then he says he wants to make up ooh you made me love you ooh you've got a way ooh you had me crawling on the floor a compromise would surely help the situation agree to disagree but disagree the part when after all it's just a compromise of the things we do for love the things we do for love
