i see the lonely road that leads so far away i see the distant lights that left behind the day but what i see is so much more than i can say and i see you midnight blue i see you cryin now you've found a lot of pain and what you're searchin for can never be the same but what's the difference cos they say what's in a name and i see you midnight blue i will love you tonight,and i will stay by your side,lovin you i'm feelin midnight blue i see you standing there far out along the way i want to touch you but the night becomes the day i count the words that i am never gonna say and i see you midnight blue i will love you tonight,and i will stay by your side,lovin you i'm feelin midnight blue can't you feel the love that i'm offering you can't you see how it's meant to be can't you hear the words that i'm saying to you can't you believe like i believe it's only one and one it's true still i see you midnight blue i see beautiful days and i feel beautiful ways of loving you,everything's midnight blue i will love you tonight,and i will stay by your side,lovin you i'm feelin midnight blue
