stood there boldly sweatin in the sun felt like a million felt like number one the height of summer i d never felt that strong like a rock i was eighteen didn't have a care working for peanuts not a dime to spare but i was lean and solid everywhere like a rock my hands were steady my eyes were clear and bright my walk had purpose my steps were quick and light and i held firmly to what i felt was right like a rock like a rock i was strong as i could be like a rock nothin ever got to me like a rock i was something to see like a rock and i stood arrow straight unencumbered by the weight of all these hustlers and their schemes i stood proud i stood tall high above it all i still believed in my dreams twenty years now where d they go twenty years i don t know i sit and i wonder sometimes where they ve gone and sometimes late at night when i m bathed in the firelight the moon comes callin a ghostly white and i recall i recall like a rock standin arrow straight like a rock chargin from the gate like a rock carryin the weight like a rock like a rock the sun upon my skin like a rock hard against the wind like a rock i see myself again like a rock
