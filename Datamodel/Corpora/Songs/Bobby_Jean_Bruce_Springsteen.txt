well i came by your house the other day your mother said you went away she said there was nothing that i could have done there was nothing nobody could say me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen i wished i would have known i wished i could have called you just to say goodbye bobby jean now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise we liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes we told each other that we were the wildest the wildest things wed ever seen now i wished you would have told me i wished i could have talked to you just to say goodbye bobby jean now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere in some bus or train traveling along in some motel room therell be a radio playing and you'll hear me sing this song well if you do you'll know i'm thinking of you and all the miles in between and i'm just calling one last time not to change your mind but just to say i miss you baby good luck goodbye bobby jean
