i hung up the phone tonight just as you said i love you once this would have been coincidence now these things start to bother me you still close your eyes when i kiss you and i close mine too but we didn't open them again quite as wide as we should this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends does your touch feel the same as it should do or is it someone quite similar who killed me with kindness last night now do i look at all familiar but none of these things seem to matter since we've grown apart i'd put back the pieces of what's shattered but i don't know where to start this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends and i feel like a clown it's tearing me up it's tearing me down you say which are the lies that you tell me well where do i begin so i turn on the tv again and the world comes crashing in is it my shirt or my toothpaste that is whiter than white is it the lies that i tell you or the lies that i might this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends this is where the home truth ends
