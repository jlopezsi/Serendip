in the hills above freno by a shiny mountain stream a young man laid where he fell in the ruins of his dreams he looked into the sky happy to see that the dawn was slowly breaking and the women knelt beside him consuela biaz chorus x2 consuela biaz she knelt there and gently she bathed his wounds and he kissed her trembling fingers consuela biaz in the town san domingo as we laughed and danced all night to the thrub of flamingo guitars seemed a long long way from tomorrow's fight he came from over the sea full of the passion of when you were born to be free from the valley of ronda consuela biaz chorus consuela biaz from the valley of ronda to the hills above freno just to die against her shoulder consuela biaz i'm sorry if i have failed you
