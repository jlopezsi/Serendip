oh shannon i might be dreaming the stars fell down on the factory the cathedrals repeating the light receding bells on another day have you ever seen my face fast asleep and dreaming oh shannon the lightning fell there's an army down by the riverside but i might be dreaming i can see that you don't believe me and i might be dreaming if i dip into your water fall through my reflection i will shadow myself anyway have you ever seen my face fast asleep and dreaming and it don't seem right that i don't get no sleep at night what's the river gonna know about leaving oh shannon the soldiers are coming the guns are drumming the night away rain rain go away come again some other day when i got time for believing have you ever seen my face fast asleep and dreaming yeah what is there left to believe in oh shannon i might be dreaming i might be wasting my life away listening to you down on under the streetlight you shudder and beat the edge of the waterway and i know if i had time i might dive in your water lie right down in the evening rain i just want this pain pain to go away come again some other day when i got time for bleeding have you ever seen my face fast asleep and dreaming and it don't seem right that i don't get no sleep at night what's the river gonna know about leaving oh shannon i might be dreaming
