who draws the crowd who plays so loud baby it's the guitar man who's gonna steal the show you know baby it's the guitar man he can make you love he can make you cry he will bring you down he will get you high something keeps him going miles and miles away to find another place to play and night after night who treats you right baby it's the guitar man who's on the radio you know baby it's the guitar man when he comes to town and you see his face and you think you might like to take his place something keeps him drifting miles and miles away searching for the songs to play then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along and you want to get the meaning out of each and every song and you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take em home he can make you love he can get you high he will bring you down he will make you cry something keeps him moving but no one seems to know what it is that makes him go then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim the voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin but he never seems to notice he's just got to find another place to play fade away got to play fade away
