i'm lying alone with my head on the phone thinking of you till it hurts i know you hurt too but what else can we do tormented and torn apart i wish i could carry your smile and my heart for times when my life feels so low it would make me believe what tomorrow could bring when today doesn't really know doesn't really know chorus i'm all out of love i'm so lost without you i know you were right believing for so long i'm all out of love what am i without you i can't be too late to say that i was so wrong i want you to come back and carry me home away from this long lonely nights i'm reaching for you are you feeling it too does the feeling seem oh so right and what would you say if i called on you now and said that i can't hold on there's no easy way it gets harder each day please love me or i'll be gone i'll be gone chorus oh what are you thinking of what are you thinking of oh what are you thinking of what are you thinking of chorus x3
