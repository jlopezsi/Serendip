music by elton john lyrics by bernie taupin available on the album breaking hearts they used to say that boys are tough as nails in every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail now things have changed i feel so old like any girl could drag my heart across the coals i was always there in the thick of things i always had the heart of every woman on a string the danger zone shone from my eyes it seemed like every inch i gained became a mile it's not the night reaching in and touching me it's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be it seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me and breaking hearts ain't what it used to be it's not the light shining in and catching me it's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be but time has come and cast a spell on me and breaking hearts ain't what it used to be and now i know what lonely means i used to give so little and gain everything the darkest part of every day is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away can't say i blame them all for being hurt after all i treated each and every one like dirt who wants a heart that's never home i face the facts and lock myself into a life alone
