many rivers to cross live from the mirage many rivers to cross but i can't seem to find my way over wandering i am lost as i travel along the white cliffs of dover yes i've got many rivers to cross and it's only my will that keeps me alive cause i've been licked washed up for years and i merely survive because of my pride and this lonliness won't leave me alone it's such a drag to be on your own cuz my man left me and he didn't say why so i guess i'll have to cry i've got many rivers to cross but just where to begin i'm playing for time cuz there've been times i find myself thinking of committing a dreadful crime and this lonliness won't leave me alone it's such a drag to be on your own my man left me and he didn't say why so i guess i'll have to cry i've got many rivers to cross but just where to begin i'm playing for time but i've been licked and washed up for years and i merely survive because of my pride many rivers to oh cross
