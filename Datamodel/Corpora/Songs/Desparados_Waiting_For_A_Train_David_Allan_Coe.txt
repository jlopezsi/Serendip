by guy clark and i'd sing the red river valley and he'd sit in the kitchen and cry run his fingers through seventy years of living wondering lord has every well i drilled ran dry we were friends me and that old man like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train he's a drifter and a driller of oil wells and an old school man of the world taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to and he'd wink and give me money for the girls and our lives was like some old western movie like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train from the time that i could walk he'd take me with him to a place called the green frog cafe and there was old men with beer guts and dominoes lying about their lives while they played like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train and i looked up and he was pushing eighty and there was brown tobacco stains all down his chin to me he's one of the heroes of this country see why's he all dressed up like some old man drinking beer and playing moon in forty-two like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train the day before he dies i went to see him i was grown and he was almost gone we just closed our eyes and dreamt us up a kitchen and sang another verse to that old song don't cry jack it's only jesus coming like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train
