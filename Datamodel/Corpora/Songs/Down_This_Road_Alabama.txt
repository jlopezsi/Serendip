down this road there's an old brick house my mama cried the day that i moved out and my first summer job was pumpin gas and fixin flats but at henry walker's texaco down this road down this road down this road there's a maple tree in a cotton field where jenny first kissed me and i can still remember the night she said good-bye i stood there like a fool and watched her go down this road down this road and it goes on forever and it goes by too fast it'll take you anywhere you want to go and every memory will bring you back down this road there's a small white church daddy lived his life by the preacher's word he raised me right i could always feel his love even when the angels called him home down this road and it goes on forever and it goes by too fast it'll take you anywhere you want to go and every memory will bring you back down this road down this road down this road
