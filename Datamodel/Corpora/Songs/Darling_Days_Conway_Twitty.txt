if i never love again i won't feel cheated you gave me more than i knew how to use on the day we met my journey was completed even though my autumn years won't be with you seems like yesterday we called each other darling seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand i'd love to hear you say good morning darling oh what i'd give to live those darling days again today my heart survives on love that's borrowed from all the happy yesterdays we knew if i knew for sure the world would end tomorrow i have to spend my last days loving you seems like yesterday we called each other darling seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand i'd love to hear you say good morning darling oh what i'd give to live those darling days again oh what i'd give to live those darling days again
