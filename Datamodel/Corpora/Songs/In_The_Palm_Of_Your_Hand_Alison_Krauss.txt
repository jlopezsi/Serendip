if i could have the world and all it owns a thousand kingdoms a thousand thrones if all the earth were mine to hold with wealth my only goal i'd spend my gold on selfish things without the love that your life brings just a little bit more is all i'd need till life was torn from me i'd rather be in the palm of your hand though rich or poor i may be faith can see right through the circumstance sees the forest in spite of the trees your grace provides for me if i should walk the streets no place to sleep no faith in promises you keep i'd have no way to buy my bread with a bottle for my bed but if i trust the one who died for me who shed his blood to set me free if i live my life to trust in you your grace will see me through i'd rather be in the palm of your hand though rich or poor i may be faith can see right through the circumstance sees the forest in spite of the trees if i could have the world if i could have the world and all it owns
