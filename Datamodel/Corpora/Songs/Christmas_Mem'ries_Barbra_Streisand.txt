singing carols stringing popcorn making footprint in the snow mem'ries christmas mem'ries they're the sweetest ones i know cookies baking in the kitchen cards and ribbons everywhere frosty christmas mem'ries float like snowflakes in the air and oh the joy of waking x-mas morning the fam'ly round the tree we had a way of making x-mas morning as merry as can be i close my eyes and see shiny faces of all the children who now have children of their own funny but come december i remember every x-mas i've known we had a way of making x-mas morning as merry as can be i close my eyes and see those shiny faces of all the children who now have children of their own it's funny but come december when i remember every x-mas i've ever known singing carols stringing popcorn shiny faces of all the children precious mem'ries of every christmas i've known
