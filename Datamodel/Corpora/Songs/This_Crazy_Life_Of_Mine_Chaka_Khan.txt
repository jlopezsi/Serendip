this is a story of mind soul and heart come to think of it don't know where to start i'd take it from the top but we don't have that much time so i'm breakin off a piece of this crazy life of mine as a little girl i had a stubborn mind bonnie and me were wild most of the time i used to sing for mama's company i guess that was the start of the woman i came to be sometimes young yet so old warm to the touch intellectually cold i love the how and why of it thank god the pieces seem to fit pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine never will forget from whence i came i have some regrets but i made myself a name two times a mother and as many times wed tough times were around me but better times ahead if your heart can handle these words i've said i see you and me in this crazy life of mine mine gotcha
