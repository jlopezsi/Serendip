sorry i know i'm late guess i lost all track of time started walking and couldn't stop turning it over in my mind trying to make some sense of it trying to make the pieces fit i thought i covered my tracks so well but now he says he knew about it from the start yeah he knew about us all along if there was any other way don't you think i've tried to find it don't you think i want to stay if there was any other way love there's no way out of this there just ain't any other way maybe i'd better be leaving now but there's something i want you to understand before i go sometimes we don't have a choice when we play and break the rules i just had to see you darlin one more time if only just to say good bye cause he knew about us all the time i never wanted to be like this i never meant to get serious but now the thought of losing you takes some getting used to
