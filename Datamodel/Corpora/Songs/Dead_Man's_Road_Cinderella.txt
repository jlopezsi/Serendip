when i was young old man sat me on his knee he told me if i had a dream i could be what i want to be now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind it's telling me to carry on now i know that it's him chorus he said whoa watch out boy don't go messing with your life cause it ain't no toy lord help ya to carry life's load it could all pass you by down on dead man's road now i got a good woman ya know she's looking out for me and if i get a little blind ya know she helps me to see but i gotta keep running because they're catching up to me i think i hear that voice again this time it says to me chorus when i was young old man sat me on his knee he told me if i had a dream i could be what i want to be now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind it's telling me to carry on now i know that it's him chorus x2
