walking in the snowy street let me understand drifting down a silent park stumbling over land open up your heart to me show me who you are and i would be your slave do you sleep in quietude do you walk in peace do you laugh out loud at me no one else that is free open up your heart to me show me all you are and i would be your slave i don't sit around and wait i don't give a damn i don't see the point at all no footprints in the sand i bet you laugh out loud at me a chance to strike me down give me peace of mind at last show me all you are open up your heart to me and i would be your slave i don't sit and wait i don't give a damn i don't see the point at all no footprints in the sand i would give you all my love nothing else is free open up your heart to me and i would be your slave
