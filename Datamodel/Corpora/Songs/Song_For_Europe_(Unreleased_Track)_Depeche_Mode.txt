here as i sit at this empty cafe thinking of you i remember all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again though the world is my oyster it's only a shell full of memories here by the seine notre-dame casts a long lonely shadow now only sorrow no tomorrow there's no today for us nothing is there for us to share but yesterday this is my song this is my song this is my song these cities may change but there always remains my obsession through silken waters my gondola glides and the bridge it sighs i remember all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again there's no more time for us nothing is there for us to share but yesterdays all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again
