he swivels his head tears his eyes from the screen as his past puts him back in atlantic city there's not even a demon in heaven or hell is it all just human disguise as i walk down the aisle gone gone gone spinning slack through the end deadens my brain falling up through the years till i swivel back round then i fly fly fly losing breath from the water then i'm gone gone gone and i'm gone gone gone now i'm older than movies let me dance away now i'm wiser than dreams let me fly fly fly while i'm touching tomorrow and i know who's there when silhouettes fall and i'm gone like i'm dancing on angels and i'm gone through a crack in the past like a dead man walking like a dead man walking three old men dancing under the lamplight shaking their sex and their bones and the boys that we were an alien nation in therapy sliding naked and new like a bad tempered child on a rain slicked street gone gone gone spinning slack through the end deadens my brain falling up through the years till i swivel back round then i fly fly fly losing breath from the water then i'm gone gone gone and i'm gone and i'm gone like i'm dancing on angels and i'm gone through the crack in the past like a dead man walking like a dead man walking like a dead man like a dead man walking and i'm gone gone gone let me dance dance dance and i'm gone gone gone let me dance dance dance and i'm gone like i'm dancing on angels and i'm gone through a crack in the past and i'm gone like i'm dancing on angels and i'm gone through a crack in the past like a dead man walking like a dead man walking like a dead man like a dead man walking
