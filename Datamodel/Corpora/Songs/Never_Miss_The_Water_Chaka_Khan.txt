all is fair in love boy when the love is shared now you've been acting for some time like you just don't care about me well my mama used to say that there would come a day when fools begin to open up their eyes chorus you never miss the water till the well runs dry now i have had enough bad love so i'm telling you goodbye goodbye you've been taking me for granted you even made me cry and sorry just ain't good enough baby not this time my mama used to say that there would come a day when the truth can no longer be denied you're gonna miss my love you're gonna miss my love you're gonna miss my love you never miss the water till the well runs dry for ya my mama used to say that there would come a day when you would run but baby you can't hide
