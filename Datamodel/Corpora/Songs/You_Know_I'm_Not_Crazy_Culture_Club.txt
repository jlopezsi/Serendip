say your mind has an overload your heart beats rhythm hot and cold your stature has a naked bucks when you're near you're not like us chorus you know i'm not crazy you know i'm not crazy i caught on to the way you smile love could only last a while i couldn't love i couldn't touch the situation was too much chorus your love fails me your love it fails me your love fails me your love it drives me crazy don't tell me that lovers always mistrust the lies in your eyes the death in your lust it's more than distraction you touch you feel our hearts dance apart and you say this is real you know i'm not crazy talk about the love we feel the passion that our hearts conceal kiss and run the fools we trust love inside a blinding lust chorus hold me to my every word forget about the things you heard time will conquer time will state we owe every tear to fate chorus your love fails me your love it fails me your love fails me your love it drives me crazy
