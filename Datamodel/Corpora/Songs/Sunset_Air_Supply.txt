watching the sun set so low tells us that it's time the day is too end nobody cries as it leaves or reaches for the light but soon back again but then i hear you sigh and wish that you could stay i'd like another day with you don't want to know where it ends i'll live with either way just tell me what i have to do where is the joy time forgets you ask me if i know it's still as before up on a breeze soaring high it comes alive each day whenever you call but now to lose your love the charm throughout my day to walk along our paths all alone i have memories enough to help me find my way to bring back all the love we've known
