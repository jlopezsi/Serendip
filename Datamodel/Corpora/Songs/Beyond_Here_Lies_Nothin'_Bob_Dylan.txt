oh well i love you pretty baby you're the only love i've ever known just as long as you stay with me the whole world is my throne beyond here lies nothin nothing we can call our own well i'm moving after midnight down boulevards of broken cars don't know what i do without it without this love that we call ours beyond here lies nothin nothing but the moon and stars down every street there's a window and every window made of glass we'll keep on loving pretty baby for as long as love will last beyond here lies nothin but the mountains of the past well my ship is in the harbor and the sails are spread listen to me pretty baby lay your hand upon my head beyond here lies nothin nothing done and nothing said
