how can i know how can i see it through your eyes now you know all those promises were lies you close your eyes you close your mind to all you lost i count the days i count the ways i count the cost all that you are no conscience all you believe no crime all that you take no reason all that you leave no rhyme all that you lose no sorrow all that you find no shame can't take away the scar you left behind how do you cry when you've run right out of tears you justify but the pain won't disappear i count the days i count the ways i count the cost all that you are no conscience all you believe no crime all that you take no reason all that you leave no rhyme all that you lose no sorrow all that you find no shame can't take away the scar you left you close your eyes you close your mind to all you lost i count the days i count the ways i count the cost all that you are no conscience all you believe no crime all that you take no reason all that you leave no rhyme all that you lose no sorrow all that you find no shame can't take away the scar you left behind
