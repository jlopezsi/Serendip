i met a boy called frank mills on september 12th right here in front of waverley but unfortunately i lost his address he was last seen with his friend a drummer he resembles george harrison of the beatles but he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back i love him but it embarrasses me to walk down the street with him he lives in brooklyn somewhere and wears a white crash helmet he has gold chains on his leather jacket and on the back are written the names mary and mom and hell's angels i would gratefully appreciate it if you see him tell him i'm in the park with my girlfriend and please tell him angela and i don't want the 2 dollars back just him
