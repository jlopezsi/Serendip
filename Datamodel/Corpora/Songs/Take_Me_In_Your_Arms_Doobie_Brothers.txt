i know you're leavin me behind i'm seein you darlin for the very last time show a little tenderness before you go please let me feel your embrace once more take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while we all must feel heartache sometimes right now right now i'm feelin mine i've tried my best to be strong but i'm not able i'm like a helpless child left in a cradle before you leave me behind let me feel happy one more time take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while i'm losin you and my happiness my life is so dark i must confess i'll never never see your smiling face no more i'll never never hear your knock upon my door before you leave me leave me behind let me feel happy one more time take me in your arms and rock me rock me a little while
