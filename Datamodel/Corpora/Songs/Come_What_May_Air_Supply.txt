when she looks at me i know the girl sees things nobody else can see all of the secret fears inside and all the craziness i hide she looks into my soul and reads me like nobody can and she doesn't judge the man she just takes me as i am chorus come what may she believes and that faith is something i've never known before come what may she loves me and that love has helped me open a door making me love myself a little more when i turn away she knows those are the times there's nothing she can say nothing that anyone can do and so she lets me live it through and when i'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty she just simply lets me be and goes right on loving me chorus x2 and when it seems my dreams have all slipped through my fingers when they just can't be found i turn around and there they are shining in her eyes
