if i give my heart to you tonight will you still be by my side or will you be gone with the morning sun like a restless bird in flight take me in your arms let the love you seek wash away your sorrow let the morning be ours to keep and if i should tell you of the love that i feel will you still be there for me or will i awake to a faded love searching for freedoms gain take me in your arms let the love you seek wash away your sorrow let the morning be ours to keep take me in your arms let the love you seek wash away your sorrow let the morning be ours to keep if i give my heart to you tonight will you still be by my side or will you be gone with the morning sun like a bird who yearns to fly
