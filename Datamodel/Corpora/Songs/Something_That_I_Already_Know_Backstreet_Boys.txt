here we are seven days and seven nights of empty tries it's ritual habitual but it's never gonna work this time we're to the point of no return and along the way the only thing we've learned is how to hurt each other i'm looking back and wondering why it took so long to realize that nothing's changed it never will all these years of standing still and still we stay in all this pain and nothing's gonna make it go away i don't wanna wait another minute put me out of my misery i can read your mind baby you're not in it and we're not what we used to be no you wouldn't have to lie to me if you would only let me go and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear something that i already know i know i know i know something that i already know i know i know i know so save your voice don't waste your breath can't you see we're at the end and this goodbye is permanent so wish me well and try to forget and all the fights and all the ways we almost made it but we never did and it's finally come to this i don't wanna wait another minute put me out of my misery i can read your mind baby you're not in it and we're not what we used to be no you wouldn't have to lie to me if you would only let me go and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear something that i already know we can not hide what we've become so sick and tired of being numb it's done it's done it's done i don't wanna wait another minute put me out of my misery i can read your mind baby you're not in it and we're not what we used to be no you wouldn't have to lie to me if you would only let me go and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear something that i already know i know i know i know something that i already know i know i know i know something that i already know cause i know i know i know cause i know cause i know
