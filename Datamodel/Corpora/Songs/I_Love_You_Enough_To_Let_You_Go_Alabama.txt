i've rehearsed this day a thousand times i've played this scene out in my mind you spread your wings you need to fly it breaks my heart to say goodbye these arms of mine want to pull you close but i love you enough to let you go my mind goes back to memories of pony rides upon my knee first day of school your brand new bike and football games on friday nights and through the years i've watched you grow and i love you enough to let you go don't look back when you drive away i don't want to change your mind i know in all your eighteen years you've never seen your daddy cry so many things i want to say you'll meet new friends you'll be okay i'll pray for you out on your own but don't forget your way back home and though i may not let it show i love you enough to let you go don't look back when you drive away i don't want to change your mind i know in all your eighteen years you've never seen your daddy cry these arms of mine want to pull you close but i love you enough to let you go
