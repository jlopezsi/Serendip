it hurts inside to know of all the times we've ever had a cry to keep away the reasoning of why we lie it only leads me down a lonely road and strange of fates as a world to a new and different time or place to live away the time of day so we can race exactly what we choose just not to believe and ooh happy was the day we met never could i ever forget you i knew too well not to stay we paid our price turn our heads close our eyes and sacrifice excuses of love that once was warm has turned to ice but only leave me cold and so alone now memories of years and fun can only turn my eyes to see all the good that's been undone but i believe we're lucky just to learn from what we were and ooh happy was the day we met never could i ever forget you i knew too well not to stay what about oooh yeah oh oh oh yeah oh if you go away oh you so happy baby now memories of years and fun can only turn my eyes to see all the good that's been undone but i believe we're lucky just to learn from what we were and ooh happy was the day we met never will i ever forget you i knew too well not to stay happy was the day we met never could i ever forget you happy was the day we met never could i ever forget you happy was the day we met never could i ever forget you
