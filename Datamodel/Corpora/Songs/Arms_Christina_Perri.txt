i never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart but you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start you put your arms around me and i believe that it's easier for you to let me go you put your arms around me and i'm home how many times will let you me change my mind and turn around i can't decide if i'll let you save my life or if i'll drown i hope that you see right through my walls i hope that you catch me cause i'm already falling i'll never let a love get so close you put your arms around me and i'm home the world is coming down on me and i can't find a reason to be loved i never wanna leave you but i can't make you bleed if i'm alone you put your arms around me and i believe that it's easier for you to let me go i hope that you see right through my walls i hope that you catch me cause i'm already falling i'll never let a love get so close you put your arms around me and i'm home i tried my best to never let you in to see the truth and i've never opened up i've never truly loved till you put your arms around me and i believe that it's easier for you to let me go i hope that you see right through my walls i hope that you catch me cause i'm already falling i'll never let a love get so close you put your arms around me and i'm home you put your arms around me and i'm home
