i don't mind the pain or the jokers cold refrain the days pass by so slowly i count them all again silence of a basement shades all closed at noon lie awake for fear of strangers darkness comes on slowly twilight is the ecstasy like a candle burning bright shadows dance until the night empty rooms and chilling smiles they go on for miles and miles but in the evening when the sun goes down crawl from the shadows got to get into town where the music is playin all across the night and every cloud disappears from sight there goes a loser another loser gone there goes another another who's alone there goes a loser another loser gone wild i don't mind if violins don't play i won't listen to them anyway i don't care what people say some things just can't be arranged icy fingers touching you silent voices calling too what else is there to lose i am here but where are you but in the evening when the sun goes down crawl from the shadows got to get into town where the music is playin all across the night and every cloud disappears from sight
