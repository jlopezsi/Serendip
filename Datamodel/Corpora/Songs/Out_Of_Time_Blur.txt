where's the love song to set us free too many people down everything turning the wrong way round and i don't know what life would be if we stop dreaming now lord knows we'd never clear the clouds and you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time to open up your mind and watch the world spinning gently out of time feel the sunshine on your face it's on a computer now gone to the future way out in space and you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time to open up your mind and watch the world spinning gently out of time and you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time to open up your mind and watch the world spinning gently out of time tell me i'm not dreaming but are we out of time we're out of time out of time out of time out of time out of time
