standin on a trap door there's a hole in the ground underneath the door there's a hole and it goes to infinity standin on a dark street there's a light in the sky followin the light through the night as it goes to infinity how can i avoid infinity how have i annoyed infinity i'm movin slow in infinity i even glow in infinity chorus it's hard being small hard bein small shrinkin into space shrinkin into space the world is just a ball world is just a ball it was my favorite place it was my favorites place lookin for the blue skies watchin for the sunrise one thing you can bet you won't see it set in infinity gonna take a light beam on the wings of the jet stream gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity how can i be friends with infinity can i make ammends with infinity how can i complain to infinity what'll i explain to infinity chorus give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity i hope i can contribute oh but i don't want a tribute hypocrites will come and say somethin really dumb in infinity i can't hear you sing in infinity i can't change a thing in infinity the absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity chorus
