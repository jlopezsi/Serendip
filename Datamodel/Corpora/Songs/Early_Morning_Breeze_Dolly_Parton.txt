i open up my door to greet the early morning sun closing it behind me and away i do run to the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree in the meadow i go walking in the early morning breeze i cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild freeing it i watch it as it flies away from me to visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun the aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves in the meadow where i'm walking in the early morning breeze misty-eyed i look about the meadow where i stray for its there i find the courage to greet the coming day for there among the flowers i kneel gently to my knees to have a word with god in the early morning breeze a rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun the aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves in the meadow where i'm walking in the early morning breeze
