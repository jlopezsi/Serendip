i'm so confused maybe it's because ti amo i wrote this whole thing just because ti amo i sit alone and i'm playing the piano i feel so strange it's just because ti amo i think i won't make it through you're always on my mind please tell me you love me too or else i'm gonna die here is what you mean to me you are an angel god sent to me and i just want you here with me holding you all the time when things go wrong everything seems nice to me i don't know why but i think it's cause ti amo i can't live without you and i don't want to try the reason's obvious it is because ti amo you mean the whole world to me you are my everything you make me fly without wings it's just the way i feel what else could i ever ask you are the dream of a lifetime and i want you beside me till the world stops to turn i can't describe the way i feel inside i don't know why maybe because ti amo all my friends wonder how i can be so lucky to have you in my life the answer's cause ti amo
