now i'm high in the city feel the evening air the crowds in the city compete for a share it's all so busy a complete affair down here as i walk through marble finding my way out to daylight one drinking orange vodka someone inside here will give us a ride dear i know a place where we both can go to set our hearts on fire i know the city's the only show can i take you for a ride i can make you satisfied all n all it's worth your while change that frown back to a smile tonight do or die in the misty city all night long a nightclub in the middle tappin time to my song catch hell for leavin they are always wrong down here as i walk through marble finding my way in the night-light two people sit and argue someone inside here will give them a ride clear i know a place where we both can go to set our hearts on fire i know the city's the only show can i take you for a ride i can make you satisfied all n all it's worth your while change that frown back to a smile tonight
