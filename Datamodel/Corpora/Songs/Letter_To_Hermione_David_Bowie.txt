the hand that wrote this letter sweeps the pillow clean so rest your head and read a treasured dream i care for no one else but you i tear my soul to cease the pain i think maybe you feel the same what can we do i'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do so i've been writing just for you they say your life is going very well they say you sparkle like a different girl but something tells me that you hide when all the world is warm and tired you cry a little in the dark well so do i i'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say but i can see it's not okay he makes you laugh he brings you out in style he treats you well and makes you up real fine and when he's strong he's strong for you and when you kiss it's something new but did you ever call my name just by mistake i'm not quite sure what i'm supposed to do so i'll just write some love to you
