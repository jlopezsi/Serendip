i remember that first night we met dancing to the sounds of clarinets dancing cheek to cheek oh how sweet you and me and this fantasy oh i remember our first night i remember how we carried on on and on until the light of dawn from the very start you stole my heart i knew right then we would never part oh i remember that first night remember that first night remember that first night i saw your love light through the candle's glow champagne was flowing and so i let myself go and when the night was over we both looked around the room remember darling chairs on the table and only me and you i remember how we carried on on and on until the light of dawn and from the very start you stole my heart i knew right then we would never part i remember that first night remember that first night remember that first night remember that first night
