graham russell all my life i've been a manual man i like the floor all the power in my hand driving up and down the road all day overtaking anything in the way alongside us came a man in a grin winding down the window clever again you know manual is far too old to keep pace then he left us cold it's automatic it's automatic it's automatic it goes by itself quick thinking and a mutual aim so on finding out the name of the game a different unit was ordered that day who wants to go thru the gears anyway the same color the same design the same car with a different mind knowing now we wouldn't take second place both saying with a smile on our face
