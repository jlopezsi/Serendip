a third floor walk-up one block east of chinatown she walked by my window while the rain is pouring down looking in she sees the easy money life everywhere and it's clear she don't approve and it's clear she don't approve through a cloud of smoke i shoot a little smile over there and i wonder what shes thinking chorus she don't mah jong mah jong she don't play she don't mah jong wait she don't let me wait she don't mah jong mah jong she don't play but she loves to play with the dark eyes burning i am opening the wall can there be no other chance i feel my fortune's turning and i wish for nothing else at all looking up i see her signal with her fingers through her hair telling me the hands are clean on the i turn a dragon tail into a pair and the game is over chorus though i don't obey her still she loves to play her chorus though i don't obey her still she loves to play her a tree blows up from where the lanterns light the parlors on the street better not wage another her and though there are not many things a pawn would i'll beat we enjoyed the difference chorus repeats till fade
