i met you on a midaway at a fair last year and you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear you were playing on the horses you were playing on the guitar strings you were playing like the devil wearing wings wearing wings you looked so grand wearing wings do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing can you fly i hear you can can you fly just like an eagle doin his hunting from the sky i followed through a sideshow to another town and i found you in a trailer on the camping grounds you were betting on some lover shootin out the dice and i thought i saw you cheating once or twice once or twice i heard ya did once or twice were you wondering was the gamble worth the price now you've packed it in i heard you did packed it in was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win lately you've been hiding it was somewhere in the news and i'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues the man calls out the numbers he sometimes mentions mine but i feel like i've been working overtime overtime i've lost my fire overtime and i envy you the valley that you've found cause i'm midway down the midway slowin down
