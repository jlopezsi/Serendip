i awoke this morning to a shattering sound and i went downstairs and found these shards of glass strewn all around and there upon the floor i found this poor broken dove and it made me realize how very fragile is this life that we so love i came back up to bed and i held you so tight and i prayed up to the father oh i prayed with all my might that he'd always keep you with me that he'd always keep you safe and when i went downstairs i found that dove had somehow up and flown away there's a magic every moment there's a miracles each day there's a magic every moment oh won't you let the music play oh won't you let the music play on a high and windy island i was gazing out to sea when a long forgotten feeling came and took control of me it was then the clouds burst open and the sun came pouring through when it hit those dancing waters in an instant all eternity i knew there's so much we take for granted there's so much we never say we get caught up in the motion of just a living day to day we are fettered to the future we are prisoners of the past and we never seem to notice til our lives have finally slipped right through our grasp there's a magic every moment there's a miracles each day there's a magic every moment oh won't you let the music play oh won't you let the music play you can see forever in a single drop of dew you can see that same forever if you look down deep inside of you there's a spark of the creator in every living thing he respects me when i work but he so loves me when i sing there's a magic every moment there's a miracles each day there's a magic every moment oh won't you let the music play oh won't you let the music play there's a magic every moment there's a miracles each day there's a magic every moment oh won't you let the music play oh won't you let the music play
