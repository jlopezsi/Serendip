i want somebody to share share the rest of my life share my innermost thoughts know my intimate details someone who'll stand by my side and give me support and in return she'll get my support she will listen to me when i want to speak about the world we live in and life in general though my views may be wrong they may even be perverted she will hear me out and won't easily be converted to my way of thinking in fact she'll often disagree but at the end of it all she will understand me i want somebody who cares for me passionately with every thought and with every breath someone who'll help me see things in a different light all the things i detest i will almost like i don't want to be tied to anyone's strings i'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things but when i'm asleep i want somebody who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly though things like this make me sick in a case like this i'll get away with it
