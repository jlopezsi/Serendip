when the autumn leaves are falling to the ground when the air gets cold then i think of us of you and i and it almost makes me cry so sad and kind of bitter sweet and the memories filled with tears and i feel my heart will break guess it all was my mistake autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees the rain fell softly on your face oh i remember every little thing about that day i remember every place grey skies you were laughing at the clouds the rain fell softly on your face the memories of our time together cannot be replaced i never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
