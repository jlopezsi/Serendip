all i want to do is see you again is that too much to ask for i just want to see your sweet smile smile the way it was before well i'll try not to hold you and i'll try not to kiss you and i won't even touch you all i want to do is see you don't you know that it's true i remember the days when we'd walk through the woods and sit on a bench for a while i treasure the way we used to laugh and play and look in each others eyes you can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance but i swear i won't touch you all i want to do is see you don't you know that it's true well i know five years is a long time and that times change oh that times change but i think that you will find people are basically the same basically the same if the water's still flowing we can go for a swim and do the things we used to do and if i'm reluctant you can pull me in and we can relive our youth oh but we'll stay friendly like sister and brother though i think i still love you all i want to do is see you don't you know that it's true
