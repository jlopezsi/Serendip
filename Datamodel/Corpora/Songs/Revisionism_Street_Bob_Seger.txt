i saw them standing on a corner bathed in ordinary light they turned away and started walkin and faded off into the night some years ago they were in fashion tonight they couldn't get a seat they've got themselves a brand new history from revisionism street written on revisionism street the years of sacrifice and struggle the arc of stardom's natural course the inevitable decline the wolves waiting at the door let's dig up something really nasty let's get some clay around their feet no ones memory is sacred round here on revisionism street we'll never be in the arena hey we'll never have to compete we'll never write a classic novel and we'll never have to be discreet alfred hitchcock isaac newton elvis presley captain bligh they're heroic or pathetic depending on which book you buy charles dickens jackie gleason burn em all turn up the heat if there's no truth use innuendo this is revisionism street let's find ourselves some old acquaintance let's see what they have to say some disgruntled ex-employee presto payday a tree falls in the forest a million copies go to print some parasitic little feeder sits back and makes a mint somewhere a baby's softly sleeping lt's innocence complete unaware they're workin late tonight on revisionism street
