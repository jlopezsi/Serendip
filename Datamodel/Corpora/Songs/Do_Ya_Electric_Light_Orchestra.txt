in this life i've seen everything i can see woman i've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand i've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun and i've seen kings and queens from the heavenly skies above i've seen old men crying at their own grave sides and i've seen pigs all sitting watching picture slides but i never seen nothin like you chorus do ya want my love do ya want my face do ya want my mind do ya want my love well i heard the crowd singin out of tune as they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light of the moon i heard the preacher bangin on the drums and i heard the police playin with their guns but i never heard nothing like you in the country where the sky touches down on the field she lay her down to rest in the morning sun they come a runnin just to get a look just to feel to touch her long black hair they don't give a damn chorus well i think you know what i'm trying to say woman that is i'd like to save you for a rainy day i've seen enough of the world to know that i've got to get it all to get it all to grow chorus
