dolly parton in my mind i've made love to you often but only in my mind can it be so cause there's someone at home that's countin on me and if i did i'm sure that he would know yes he would know yes he could tell for he has loved me long enough to know me very well and if i lied he'd see it in my eyes i know my guilt would show and he would know but i must admit you're someone very special and it would be so easy to let go makin love to you could be so easy but if i did i'm sure that he would know yes he would know yes he could tell for he has loved me long enough to know me very well and if i lied he'd see it in my eyes i know my guilt would show and he would know my conscience just won't let me make love to you i know it would be sweet but i just can't when i go home to him i must be able to look him in the eyes and say i ain't cause he would know yes he could tell for he has loved me long enough to know me very well and if i lied he'd see it in my eyes i know my guilt would show and he would know he would know
