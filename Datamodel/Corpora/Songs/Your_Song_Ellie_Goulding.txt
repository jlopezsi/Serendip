it's a little bit funny this feeling inside i'm not one of those who can easily hide i don't have much money but boy if i did i'd buy a big house where we both could live so excuse me forgetting but these things i do see i've forgotten if they're green or they're blue anyway the thing is what i really mean yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen and you can tell everybody this is your song it maybe quite simple but now that it's done i hope you don't mind i hope you don't mind that i put down in words how wonderful life is now you're in the world if i was a sculptor but then again no or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show i know it's not much but it's the best i can do my gift is my song and this one's for you oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and you can tell everybody this is your song it may be quite simple but now that it's done i hope you don't mind i hope you don't mind that i put down in words how wonderful life is now you're in the world
