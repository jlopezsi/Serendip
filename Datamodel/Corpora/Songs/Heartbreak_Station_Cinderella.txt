waiting at the station tears filling up my eyes sometimes the pain you hide burns like a fire inside look out my window sometimes it's hard to see the things you want in life come and go so easily she took the last train out of my heart oh oh she took the last train and now i think i'll make a brand new start she took the last train out of my heart watching the days go by thinking bout the plans we made the days turn into years funny how they fade away sometimes i think of those days sometimes i just hide away waiting on that 9:20 train waiting on a memory she took the last train out of my heart oh oh she took the last train and now i think i'll make a brand new start she took the last train out of my heart my lady's on the fly and she's never coming back my love is like a steam train rolling down the tracks yea yea she took the last train out of my heart oh oh she took the last train and now i think i'll make a brand new start she took the last train out of my heart she took the last train oh out of my heart she took the last train and now i think i'll make a new start last train out of my heart
