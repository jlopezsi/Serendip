i am not such a clever one about the latest fads i admit i was never one adored by local lads not that i ever try to be a saint i'm the type that they classify as quaint i'm old fashioned i love the moonlight i love the old fashioned things the sound of rain upon a window pane the starry song that april sings this year's fancies are passing fancies but sighing sighs holding hands these my heart understands i know i'm old fashioned but i don't mind it that's how i want to be as long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me i'm old fashioned but i don't mind it that's how i want to be as long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me oh won't you stay old fashioned with me oh please stay old fashioned with me
