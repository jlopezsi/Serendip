comes rain put your rubber on your feed comes a snow you can get a little heat comes love nothing can be done comes a fire you know what to do blow a tire buy another shoe comes love nothing can be done don't try hiding cause there isn't any use you start sliding when you're heart turns on the juice comes a headache you can lose it in a day comes a toothache see your dentist right away comes love nothing can be done comes a heatwave you can hurry to the shore comes the you can hide behind the door comes love nothing can be done comes the measles comes love nothing can be done that all brother if you've ever bin in love that all brother you know where i'm speaking of comes a nightmare you can always stay awake comes depression you may get another break comes love nothing can be done
