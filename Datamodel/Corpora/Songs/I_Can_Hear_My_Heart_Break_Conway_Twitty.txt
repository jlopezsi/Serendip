i'm surrounded by silence tormented by dreams tortured by sweet words that you didn't mean it's the stillness it's the silence that i can hardly take for i can hear i can hear my heart break now these arms are mighty lonesome guess they're missing you and i have to admit it honey i miss you too i sit here in the silence half asleep half awake and i can hear i can hear my heart break empty days without number lonely nights i can't bear that old world's gone right on by me who's to know who's to care i keep listening for your footsteps little sound you used to make and i can hear i can hear my heart break my heart break
