you're a pretty butterfly you keep on passing by you never land inside my hands your home is in the sky and there's a lesson waiting to be learned the fire starters always get the best and the good guys never get the girl no shooting stars cannot fix the world and i've made the same mistakes but i won't this time no i won't this time and you're a pretty butterfly and i believed all your lies blinded by your sideways smile and the kindness in your eyes but there's a limit to your flight i can offer you a better life but you keep on flying from the light and i've lost my faith in wrong and right and i've made the same mistakes but i won't this time no i won't this time i know exactly what you do i made damn sure i studied you you won't pick me i'm just a breeze underneath your wings so i pray each night you'll change your mind and maybe i'm worth the fight but i am wrong every time you only know how to fly you only know how to fly you only know how to fly
