we met some time ago when we were almost young it never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from i didn't have much money so i stole you a rose you were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes i never thought i'd lose you,nor i'd rather go blind i thought i saw a future but the fortune teller lied your love was my salvation it could always get me high what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine i know i wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes when i was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat the first night i said i love you you told me to go to hell you were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel just like everything good love has to die ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye your love was my salvation it could always get me high what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine just like everything good love has to die no one even cried we were one of a kind love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine your love was my salvation it could always get me high you take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine
