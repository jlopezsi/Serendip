hey this song is for marilyn and every drag queen oh brother it's not like the past we're wearing stilettos and talking too fast passing the mirror hung up in pose the boys they were fairest in immaculate clothes lunch with janet street porter and marilyn's nose but this life is a baby so sad when it grows into you and me ah what the hell we're gonna be where will we go and what will we be if we can't communicate intelligently there's a price on my head but i've never been free i said how d'ya keep your credibility no more crying no more trying please no more dying i just wanna be free i'm taking the trouble right to your door why'd you do it you bastard don't love you no more sinners beside me saints on the right and if you slow down you'll be a turkey tonight c'mon let's go a little further don't be uptight if you feel insecure well just turn off the light where will we go and what will we be if we can't communicate intelligently there's a price on my head but i've never been free i said how d'ya keep your credibility i said how d'ya keep your credibility
