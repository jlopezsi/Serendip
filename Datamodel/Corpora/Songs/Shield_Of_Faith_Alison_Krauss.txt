sometimes i'm battle weary i forget to use my shield the arrows pierce my armor and i stumble in the filed a shield won't do much good if it's hangin by your side keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive i'll think my life is over but the lord he comes to me he heals my wounded spirit and he sets me on my feet a shield won't do much good if it's hangin by your side keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive sometimes your battle weary but the war's already won keep your head and hold your shield high til your days of life are done a shield won't do much good if it's hangin by your side keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
