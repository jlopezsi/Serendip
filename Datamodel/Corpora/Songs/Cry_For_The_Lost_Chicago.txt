something i forgot that i used to know keeps on coming back around somewhere in the dark right before the dawn like a light from down the hall suddenly some old familiar music songs i know i've never heard before i gotta play along i can't refuse it i hear the call we've all been so proud of our blindness no kindness to share chorus i used to cry for the lost until i had to turn away then i looked inside past the fool and found some deeper words to say to bring us together we can make it better we can make it right we hide behind the veil of our own success while we're following the rules our eyes refuse to see past our little hands to the never changing truth freedom needs to speak a little louder justice needs to try her other arm some of us could push a little harder to sound the alarm and i see children marching and i hear the drums again i used to cry for the lost until i had to turn away then i looked inside past the fool and found some deeper words to say if we hope and pray it will come give it half a chance everyone understand in our hearts and our mind you know there's nothing left to hide we're already there i used to cry cry for the lost i was walking away i used to try to find a reason then i looked inside i used to mind every time i was walking away i gotta find what i'm feeling to bring us together chorus repeats till fade
