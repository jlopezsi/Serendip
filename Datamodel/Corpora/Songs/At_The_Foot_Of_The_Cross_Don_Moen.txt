verse 1 at the foot of the cross where grace and suffering meet you have shown me your love through the judgment you received and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can chorus trade these ashes in for beauty and wear forgiveness like a crown coming to kiss the feet of mercy i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross verse 2 at the foot of the cross where i am made complete you have given me life through the death you bore for me and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can repeat chorus twice then instrumental bridge and you've won my heart and you've won my heart now i can repeat twice chorus i lay every burden down i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross at the foot of the cross
