i dreamed of my old lover last night i wonder if i spoke out loud and if by chance my husband overheard he put my face back in the crowd his eyes were clear and gentle then he kissed the troubles from my brow i long to fall to sleep again and i wonder how he would look now would our kids grow sullen or grow strong would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun i like the way it feels but then i rarely dream of anyone in the songs of shame and the tales of dread where they seal the lovers lips with lead and all the vines wind through their eyes oh but no one knows this passion now oh no one knows this passion now so i keep this fancy to myself i keep my lipstick twisted tight i long to fall to sleep again i dreamed of my old lover last night i long to fall to sleep again cause i dreamed of my old lover last night
