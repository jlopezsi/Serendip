well it's about time it's beginning to hurt time you made up your mind just what is it all worth all my useless advice all my hanging around all your cutting down to size all my bringing you down watch the clock on the wall feel the slowing of time hear a voice in the hall echoing in my mind all your stupid ideals got your head in the clouds you should see how it feels with your feet on the ground here i stand the accused with your fist in my face feeling tired and bruised with the bitterest taste all my useless advice all my hanging around all your cutting down to size all my bringing you down all your stupid ideals got your head in the clouds you should see how it feels with your feet on the ground
