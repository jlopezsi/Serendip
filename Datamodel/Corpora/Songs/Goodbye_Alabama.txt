before i fly and wave goodbye i say to you days with you are the best years of my life but if i don't see you anymore keep my words safely stored and i'll be back i promise once more chorus goodbye goodbye till i see you again goodbye goodbye i'll love and i'll miss you till then remember me cause i care where you are and how you fare get in touch if the wind blows in your face i guess it's been too much fun we've shared and we've won yes the best is yet to come repeat chorus that one word hurts so bad you leave the best you've had but you keep the faith and pray to return goodbye goodbye i'll love and i'll miss you till then goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye c 1990 maypop music a division of wildcountry inc bmi all rights reserved
