i know the times the times are hard to bear it's hard to find someone to really care but before i went down and out here's what i used to think about think about london bridge is always fallin down but there it stood within the heart of town reminding everyone of life behind and life to come the changes taking place are everywhere the centuries past have nothing to compare where they stand where they trip and fall watch the writing on the wall on the wall london bridge is fallin down at last and so another memory of the past has fell beneath the blade but soon the dead may be repaid i know things just can't evolve for all eternity the thoughts will leave will never die and now so you can see london bridge is finally fallin down it packed it up and shipped it outta town and though the horror's gone the memory will linger on london bridge is finally fallin down it used to stand within the heart of town reminding everyone of life behind and life to come london bridge is finally fallin down
