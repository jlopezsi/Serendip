i was living in a fantasy waiting for somebody to rescue me but i've found a way to light the dark it was always here inside my heart no more fairy tale pretending i'll make my own happy ending if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings i wouldn't reach up to the sky every night in my dreams there's a voice inside of me saying i can do anything cause if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings there's a star that's shining down on me reflecting everything that i can be every journey starts inside the heart and there's no mountain that's too far if i set my mind to it whatever it is i can do it if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings i wouldn't reach up to the sky every night in my dreams there's a voice inside of me saying i can do anything cause if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings to take me farther than i ever thought i'd go higher than the heavens cause deep inside i know if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings i wouldn't reach up to the sky every night in my dreams there's a voice inside of me saying i can do anything cause if i wasn't meant to fly i wouldn't have these wings
