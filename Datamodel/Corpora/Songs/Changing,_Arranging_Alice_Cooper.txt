i'm changing arranging things i never thought i'd move before i'm changing arranging to your personality i asked for it before i need a soul who'll never say what i feel just fearing that i will accept the ideal i look up high and i swear all i see it's a carbon copy image of me i'm dying hard trying baby baby for the rest of my life i'm trying hard dying maybe maybe he's trying to be my life i've got a never ending battle inside just trying to rectify my personal pride i swear i don't know what it's got over me but i know it doesn't want to be free
