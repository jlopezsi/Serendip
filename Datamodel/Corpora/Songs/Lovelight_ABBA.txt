i've always hated my room it's so gloomy and dreary always the dark for the windows just face the back yard so i can't understand how it's happened how everything's changing this old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter when you walked into the room it all got so much brighter you must have a lovelight everything around you is lovelight and i can feel your love anywhere shining maybe even when you're not there shining the lovelight everything around you is lovelight you're shining like a star in the night shining i won't let you out of my sight shining i don't want to lose you i don't want to lose your lovelight how i remember the first time we went to movie we had decided to meet on the corner downtown and i waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me and the traffic seemed to get a little lighter when you came into my life it all got so much brighter you must have a lovelight everything around you is lovelight and i can feel your love anywhere shining maybe even when you're not there shining the lovelight everything around you is lovelight you're shining like a star in the night shining i won't let you out of my sight shining i don't want to lose you i don't want to lose your lovelight and i feel so good and i feel so right and i know that you must have a lovelight you've got lovelight and i can feel your love anywhere maybe even when you're not there you've got lovelight everything around you is lovelight you're shining like a star in the night shining i won't let you out of my sight shining i don't want to lose you i don't want to lose your lovelight everything about you is right let it glow and let it be bright i don't want to lose your lovelight shining like a star in the night
