sweetheart the night is growing old sweetheart my love is still untold a kiss that is never tasted forever and ever is wasted for all we know we may never meet again before you go make this moment sweet again we won't say goodnight until the last minute i'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it for all we know this may only be a dream we come and go like a ripple on a stream so love me tonight tomorrow was made for some tomorrow may never come for all we know
