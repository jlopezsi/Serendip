i'll say goodbye to love no one ever cared if i should live or die time and time again the chance for love has passed me by and all i know of love is how to live without it i just can't seem to find it so i've made my mind up i must live my life alone and though it's not the easy way i guess i've always known i'd say goodbye to love there are no tomorrows for this heart of mine surely time will lose these bitter memories and i'll find that there is someone to believe in and to live for something i could live for all the years of useless search have finally reached an end loneliness and empty days will be my only friend from this day love is forgotten i'll go on as best i can what lies in the future is a mystery to us all no one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls there may come a time when i will see that i've been wrong but for now this is my song and it's goodbye to love i'll say goodbye to love
