there's no way out and there's no way back sailing forever out along your path some troubles dare to lose you sleep i started thinkin that i'm in too deep the wheels of life will stretch your face squeeze you flat without a trace but when i was in trouble i never heard you speak i got the message that i'm in too deep blows my mind melting in the sun sun starts to shine shine then suddenly it's gone melting in the sun stayed up and wondered what was goin on shifted and pissed up and silent and gone reasons for promises that no one could keep i got the picture and i'm in too deep blows my mind melting in the sun sun starts to shine shine then suddenly it's gone melting in the sun there's no way out the only way is in don't matter who you are don't matter where you've been you can buy your freedom but it don't come cheap no doubt about it now i'm in too deep blows my mind melting in the sun sun starts to shine shine then suddenly it's gone melting in the sun yeah suddenly it's gone melting in the sun suddenly it's gone melting in the sun
