i'm lost in imagination still contemplate animation i just groove on your breathing i do it all for you you've got a problem witcha boyfriend he don't squeeze you right he got you facedown and waiting baby keep you waiting all night so do me a favour won't you move with me slowly get too close to me move with me slowly just like we're meant to be just like we're meant to be hey say sister you're dreaming you got stars in your eyes a little conscious behavior is gonna cut you down to size you hear me knocking so let me in when your blood runs cold and your love wears thin it's over passion it's under the skin if love ain't a miracle it sure ain't a sin so let me in take me to the city take me on my knees take me anyway you find me baby i've got this love disease and there ain't nothin i can do
