where did we come from why are we here where do we go when we die what lies beyond and what lay before is anything certain in life they say life is too short the here and the now and you're only given one shot but could there be more have i lived before or could this be all that we've got if i die tomorrow i'd be all right because i believe that after we're gone the spirit carries on i used to be frightened of dying i used to think death was the end but that was before i'm not scared anymore i know that my soul will transcend i may never find all the answers i may never understand why i may never prove what i know to be true but i know that i still have to try if i die tomorrow i'd be alright because i believe that after we're gone the spirit carries on move on be brave don't weep at my grave because i am no longer here but please never let your memory of me disappear safe in the light that surrounds me free of the fear and the pain my questioning mind has helped me to find the meaning in my life again victoria's real i finally feel at peace with the girl in my dreams and now that i'm here it's perfectly clear i found out what all of this means if i die tomorrow i'd be alright because i believe that after we're gone the spirit carries on
