a shot in the dark a past lost in space and where do i start the past and the chase you hunted me down like a wolf a predator i felt like a deer in the lights you loved me and i froze in time hungry for that flesh of mine but i can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees what do you see in those yellow eyes cause i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces falling to pieces did she lie and wait was i bait to pull you in the thrill of the kill you feel is a sin i lay with the wolves alone it seems i thought i was part of you you loved me and i froze in time hungry for that flesh of mine but i can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees what do you see in those yellow eyes cause i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces falling to pieces i'm falling to pieces falling to pieces
