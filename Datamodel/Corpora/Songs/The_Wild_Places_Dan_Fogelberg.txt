i was walking alone through the lofty san juans with a heart full of light and a head full of songs i was thinking of time and how much it will cost to recapture the souls that we surely have lost in the cities and towns there are millions who dream but the traffic's so loud that you can't hear them scream there's a heaven on earth that so few ever find though the map's in your soul and the road's in your mind so many mountains before us so many rivers to cross where is the wisdom to bring back the vision we've lost can we gaze with wonder of children into the deafening night has it gotten so dark that we cannot remember the light when you sleep on the ground with the stars in your face you can feel the full length of the beauty and grace in the wild places man is an unwelcome guest but it's here than i'm found and it's here i feel blessed
