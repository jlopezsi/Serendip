i've been in love i've walked alone i turned to you but you were gone i felt the doubt it hurt me inside without your help my hands are tied you are my home my place to go my faith returned you told me so i feel you now i'm standing beside you do you hear me calling it's to remind you if you find me falling hold me in your arms tell me that you want me whisper all the words that dreams are made of hold me in your arms tell me are we speaking of love don't leave me know i've come so far to hear your voice speak from your heart i hear you now you're standing beside me do you hear me calling it's to remind you if you find me falling hold me in your arms tell me that you want me whisper all the words that dreams are made of hold me in your arms tell me are we speaking of love
