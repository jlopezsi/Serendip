faith for reasons still unknown like bleak house fog seems everywhere the truth has frozen into stone and hope lies freezing in the midnight air though dark our days may seem this is a different dream their freedom light don't shine at all so i will light a candle for you keep it burning in the night and pray that you are all right i will light a candle for you little candle burning bright when school yard heroes disappeared the little girl she stands alone oh i believe you if you say a prayer can help to get her home so i will light a candle for you keep it burning in the night and pray that you are all right i will light a candle for you little candle burning bright
