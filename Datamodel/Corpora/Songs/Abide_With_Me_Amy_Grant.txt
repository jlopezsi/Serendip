abide with me fast falls the eventide the darkenss deepens lord with me abide when other helpers fail and comforts flee help of the helpless o abide with me i need thy presence every passing hour what but thy grace can foil the tempter's power who like thyself my guide and stay can be through cloud and sunshine o abide with me abide with me abide abide with me i fear no foe with thee at hand to bless ills have no weight and tears no bitterness where is death's sting where grave thy victory i triumph still if thou abide with me abide with me abide abide with me abide with me abide abide with me
