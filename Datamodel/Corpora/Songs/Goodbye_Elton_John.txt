and now that it's all over the birds can nest again i'll only snow when the sun comes out i'll shine only when it starts to rain and if you want a drink just squeeze my hand and wine will flow into the land and feed my lambs for i am a mirror i can reflect the moon i will write songs for you i'll be your silver spoon i'm sorry i took your time i am the poem that doesn't rhyme just turn back a page i'll waste away i'll waste away i'll waste away i'll waste away i'll waste away i'll waste away
