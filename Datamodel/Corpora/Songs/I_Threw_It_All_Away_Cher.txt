i once held him in my arms he said he would always stay but i was cruel i treated him like a fool don't you know i threw it all away once i had mountains in the palm of my hand and rivers that ran through everyday i must have been mad i never knew what i had until i threw it all away until i threw it all away love is all there is it makes the world go around love and only love it can't be deny no matter what you think about it you can't do without it take a tip from one who's tried so if you find someone gives you all his love take it to your heart don't let it stray ah one thing's for certain you're surely gonna be hurtin if you throw it all away if you throw it all away
