well this old world can get you down and leave you spinning round and round not knowing what's for real on this crazy wheel is part of the deal baby there's only one sure thing i know i never want to let you go i'll be here by your side on this circus ride through every drop and climb til the end of time when everything is moving fast it's hard to stay together i know that we can make it last we'll find a way to weather any storm heaven sends we'll see it through to the end we've got it made if you can just believe you'll always be loved by me and when you go to bed at night and i'm not there to hold you tight i'll love you from afar no matter where you are i'll count the days til when i'm with you again and when we're growin old i'll be the one to hold you close when everything is fading fast we'll face the end together we'll find a way to make it past one final storm to weather and even after the end i will be with you again we've got it made if you can just believe you'll always be loved by me
