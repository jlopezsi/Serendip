i've had many times i can tell you times when innocence i'd trade for company and children saw me crying i thought i'd had my share of that but these miss you nights are the longest midnight diamonds stud my heaven southward burning lie the jewels that i obey summer warm winds that embrace me just as surely kissed your face yeah these miss you nights are the longest how i missed you i'm not likely to tell i'm a man and cold day light buys the pride i'd rather sell all my secrets are wasted affair you know them well thinking of my going how to cut the thread and leave it all behind looking windward for my comfort i take each day as it arrives but these miss you nights are the longest lay down all thoughts of your surrender it's only me who's killing time lay down all dreams and themes once remembered it's just the same this miss you game yeah these miss you nights are the longest
