there's a hole where my heart should be and baby only you can fill this emptiness in me there's a hole where my heart should be so baby wrap it up pack it up bring your lovin back to me chorus everytime that we're apart i close my eyes and i i can't help think of you but girl unless you're in my arms it's just not feeling right the telephone won't do the space is killing me it just won't let me be and just the thought of you girl can make me weak i feel so incomplete i'm looking at your photograph i dream i'm holding you i dream i'm kissing you but girl your picture never kisses back it's just not good enough i need your human touch everyone can see what's missing here with me and just the thought of you girl can make me weak i feel so incomplete chorus 2x girl i'm a million miles from heaven cause heaven is wherever you are i need you to feel alive again oh
