touched by a butterfly on my way home flying who knows where walking down that dusty road without a care the sun was shining up in the country and bells were ringing downtown clouds were moving slow and lazy while i was kicking around and feeling out the town and the country feeling out the town and the country up on the hill i got a better look i watched the river run brown watched the river run brown and then i heard those songbirds singing the country sound when i got home i sat in my kitchen and turned the television on turned the tv on the news wasn't good so i didn't listen i started clicking around thinking of the town and the country i was thinking of the town and the country thinking of the town and the country in the morning everything will be the same open up your world watch the children play in the sun or rain thinking of the town and the country a thinking of the town and the country i was thinking of the town and the country fade
