i'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment waiting for your phone calls all to end i'm sitting watching wind blow watching time go watching cars go by i'm waiting for these memories to begin if i threw my guitar out the window so far down would i start to regret it or would i smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here the clamor of jackhammers seems so faint well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot i don't think that i'll ever be the same if i threw my guitar out the window so far down would i start to regret it or would i smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall if i threw my guitar out the window so far down would i start to regret it or would i smile and watch it slowly fall fall fall
