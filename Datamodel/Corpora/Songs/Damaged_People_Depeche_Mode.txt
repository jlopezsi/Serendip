we're damaged people drawn together by subtleties that we are not aware of disturbed souls playing out forever these games that we once thought we would be scared of when you're in my arms the world makes sense there is no pretense and you're crying when you're by my side there is no defense i forget to sense i'm dying we're damaged people praying for something that doesn't come from somewhere deep inside us depraved souls trusting in the one thing the one thing that this life has not denied us when i feel the warmth of your very soul i forget i'm cold and crying when your lips touch mine and i lose control i forget i'm old and dying
