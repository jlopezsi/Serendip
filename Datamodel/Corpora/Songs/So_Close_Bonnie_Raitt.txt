so far there was not a second thought no heart ever got close enough you are watching as i am caught in a moment off-guard so close i can nearly taste it suppose this is that one promised love god knows all that i've wasted now never letting it start now all my resistance i feel it slip away now all of the distance ever less with every day by day so far there was no connection no spark out of which a fire grows i start in your direction i'm ever so close now all my resistance i feel it slip away now all of the distance ever less with every day by day so far i have never been so close
