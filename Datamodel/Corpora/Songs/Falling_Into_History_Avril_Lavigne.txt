don't matter what people say i never did believe them i know i know they know everything i'll be alright by myself and no one's gonna tell me i'm defined confined by love now our days seem strange i guess my heart was bound to change i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history i never thought that i'd say that i don't really miss you i lived i breathed your breath through me time has a way of passing by until i don't remember why or how to hurt for you love's pain has gone somewhere and i'm finally hanging it there i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history falling into falling into you're falling into history i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history i fell out out of you and me you're fading from view and you're falling into history i'll be alright by myself and no one's gonna tell me i'm defined confined by love
