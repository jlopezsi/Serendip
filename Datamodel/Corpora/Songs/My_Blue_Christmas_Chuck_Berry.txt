if i could only have an hour of this holiday with you we could sit and rap together spinning records old and new have a little cake and a bit o coke now and do the things we used to do jingle bells will all be ringing and little kids eyes all aglow children strolling singing carols makin tracks out in the snow oh but i'll be with you this christmas maybe yes and maybe no christmas time is really joyful oh but it's a lonely season too many people are so cheerful and some are alone and blue what would make my christmas happy if i could have it all alone with you but if i just can't be with you let me call you on the phone i wanna tell you i still love you and how it feels to be alone wanna wish you a merry christmas as the old year passes on
