i stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade i combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade i was open to pain and crossed by the rain and i walked on a crooked crutch i strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said sit down i stood up ooh-ooh growin up the flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing i had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could sing i pushed b-52 and bombed em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing i broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said come down i threw up ooh-ooh growin up i took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath i swear i lost everything i ever loved or feared i was the cosmic kid well my feet they finally took root in the earth but i got me a nice little place in the stars i swear i found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said sit down i stood up ooh-ooh growin up ooh-ooh growin up
