i can't really explain it i haven't got the words it's a feeling that you can't control i suppose its like forgetting losing who you are and at the same time something makes you whole its like that there's a music playing in your ear and i'm listening and i'm listening and then i disappear and then i feel a change like a fire deep inside something bursting me wide open impossible to hide and suddenly i'm flying flying like a bird like electricity electricity sparks inside of me and i'm free i'm free it's a bit like being angry it's a bit like being scared confused and all mixed up and mad as hell it's like when you've been crying and you're empty and you're full i don't know what it is it's hard to tell its like that there's some music playing in your ear but the music is impossible impossible to hear but then i feel it move me like a burning deep inside something bursting me wide open impossible to hide then suddenly i'm flying flying like a bird like electricity electricity sparks inside of me and i'm free i'm free electricity sparks inside of me and i'm free i'm free oh oh whoa i'm free
