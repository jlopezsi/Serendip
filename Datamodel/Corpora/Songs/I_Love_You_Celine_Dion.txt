i must be crazy now maybe i dream too much but when i think of you i long to feel your touch to whisper in your ear words that are old as time words only you would hear if only you were mine i wish i could go back to the very first day i saw you should've made my move when you looked in my eyes cause by now i know that you'd feel the way that i do and i'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side i love you please say you love me too these three words they could change our lives forever and i promise you that we will always be together till the end of time so today i finally find the courage deep inside just to walk right up to your door but my body can't move when i finally get to it just like a thousand times before then without a word he handed me this letter read i hope this finds the way into your heart it said i love you please say you love me too these three words they could change our lives forever and i promise you that we will always be together till the end of time well maybe i i need a little love yeah and maybe i i need a little care and maybe i maybe you maybe you maybe you oh you need somebody just to hold you if you do just reach out and i'll be there i love you please say you love me too please say you love me too till the end of time these three words they could change our lives forever and i promise you that we will always be together oh i love you please say you love me too please please say you love me too till the end of time my baby together together forever till the end of time i love you i will be your light shining bright shining through your eyes my baby
