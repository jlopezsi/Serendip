one day you're happy the next day you're blue you feel like the whole world's comin right down on you there ain't nothin wrong but then there ain't nothin right it's just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night heavy tears in your eyes lord don't they hurt you when you cry heavy tears in your eyes and when they hit the ground don't they make a terrible sound maybe she loves you and maybe it's a joke and maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke you don't feel warm but then you don't feel cold you're just gettin weary you're just gettin old heavy tears in your eyes and your mind can't take this worry and your heart feels underfed maybe you'll wake up tomorrow or maybe you'll just stay in bed don't call the doctor and ask his advice cause he's felt the same way himself once or twice and there ain't no cure for the tear in your eye you just gotta sit there you just gotta cry heavy tears in your eyes
