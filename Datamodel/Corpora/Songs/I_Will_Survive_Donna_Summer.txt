at first i was afriad i was petrified kept think how i'm going to live without you by me side but then i spend so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong but i grew strong and i learned how to get along and now you back from outer space don't turn around cause your not welcome any more weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye you'd think i'd crumble youd think i'd lay down and die now go now go walk out the door don't turn around now cause your not welcome anymore weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye you'd think i's crumble you'd think i'd lay down and die oh no not i i will survive oh as long as i know how to love i'll know i'll stay alive i ve got all my life to live i've got all my love to give i will survive i will survive hey hey hey selena had made up a disco medly for this song with other songs by donna summer
