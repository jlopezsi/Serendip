i heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play and wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth peace on earth i thought how as the day had come the belfries of all christendom had rolled along the unbroken song of peace on earth peace on earth peace on earth good will to men and in despair i bowed my head there is no peace on earth i said for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth peace on earth then pealed the bells more loud and deep god is not dead nor doth he sleep the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth peace on earth
