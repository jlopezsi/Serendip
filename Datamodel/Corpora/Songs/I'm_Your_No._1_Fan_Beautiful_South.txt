i was handed down the looks of a man with a broken nose that's the way our family was i suppose but at least you gave me deeply profound as we lay and chatted late upon the cricket ground you didn't have to love me where others got rid you didn't have to treat me like a very good friend but i'm glad that you did one thing i never said to you and one thing i never can amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers i'm your no 1 fan i'm your no 1 fan i'm the richly blessed daughter of a mother with tattooed arms that's the way my family life life was charmed but at least it gave me mental grace and a thought at the pit on my mind and a smile on my face you didn't have to listen to a word that i'd said you didn't have to tell me all those silly old jokes for every tear that i shed every tear that i shed cause one thing i never said to you and one thing i never can amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers i'm your no 1 fan i'm your no 1 fan i was handed down a bike with a crooked old wheel but i rode it on a million lanes the way that you made me feel but at least we thought about it so long and hard as we sat upon our mother in the graveyard and you don't have to listen to a word in this song your picture hangs the same and in the same old place even though that you've gone even though that you've gone cos one thing i never said to you and one thing i never can amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers i'm your no 1 fan i'm your no 1 fan yes i am i'm your no 1 fan
