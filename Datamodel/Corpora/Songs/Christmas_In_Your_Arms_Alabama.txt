all my friends are asking me where i plan to spend the holidays people seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm i don't care about the weather just whether i spend christmas in your arms chorus we could drive up to the mountains build a fire and watch it snow we could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow i'd be happy in the city i'd be happy on the farm i don't care where i spend christmas as long as i spend christmas in your arms it was only last december i had no christmas spirit in my heart my world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart but now you're here beside me no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree and the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me chorus i don't care where i spend christmas as long as i spend christmas in your arms
