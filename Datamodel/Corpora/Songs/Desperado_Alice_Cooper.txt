i'm a gambler and i'm a runner but you knew that when you lay down i'm a picture of ugly stories i'm a killer and i'm a clown step into the street by sundown step into your last goodbye you're a target just by living twenty dollars will make you die i wear lace and i wear black leather my hands are lightning up on my gun my shots are clean and my my shots are final my shots are deadly and when it's done you're as stiff as my smoking barrel you're as dead as a desert night you're a notch and i'm a legend you're at peace and i must hide tell where the hell i'm going let my bones fall in the dust can't you hear that ghost that's calling as my colt begins to rust in the dust i'm a killer i'm a clown i'm a priest that's gone to town
