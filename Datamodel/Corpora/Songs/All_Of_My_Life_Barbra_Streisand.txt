i was alone you were alone parallel lines that touched one another just feeling our way lost in the dark drawn to each other so much to say so much to do so much of you for me to discover like what makes you laugh what makes you cry how does a friend become a lover too i've waited all of my life to find someone who'd need my heart and read my mind to light my days and warm my nights someone i know i could call my someone for all my life looking at you looking at me loving the look of love that i see there i find when i look deep in your eyes reflections of me there i've waited all of my life to find someone who'd need my heart and read my mind to light my days and warm my nights now all at once in your arms everything's new all that i feel tells me it's true all that i ask is all of my life with you
