we walked away before there were too many storms we could not get through but i still kept loving you now fate brought you back to me this time i won't let you leave i'm holding on to you forever i'm never letting go the time i spent away from you was time that made me see i need to live this life with you i need you here with me now it would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again to take me from your side it would take a strong strong wind to pull away this heart of mine to make us break apart this time it would take a strong strong wind hearts sometimes lose their way but they find their way back someday to the arms they need and i need you like the air i breathe the time i spent away from you was time lost in the rain i'm meant to live this life with you that's something nothing can change and it would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again to take me from your side it would take a strong strong wind to pull away this heart of mine to make us break apart this time it would take a strong strong wind this time i'm holding on with everything this time i won't let go for anything it would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again to take me from your side it would take a strong strong wind to pull away this heart of mine to make us break apart this time it would take a strong strong wind strong strong wind
