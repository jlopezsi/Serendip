they're almost falling over you why don't they call a truce what ever they are trying to do it's of little use they're drowning you in compliments trying to furnish proof and though they speak with eloquence there is little truth chorus you're bright you're strong you know your right from wrong at least to some degree you're wise you're tough you've heard their lies enough you smile in sympathy i'm watching your serenity the way your soul transcends their tedious obscenities you're patience never ends and as the night begins to fade you are heading for the door followed by a sad parade you're on your own once more chorus x2 you're bright you're strong you know your right from wrong at least to some degree you're wise you're tough you've heard their lies enough you smile in sympathy
