all the late night bargains have been struck between the satin beans and their bells prehistoric garbage trucks got the city to themselves echoes and the roars dinosaurs they're all doing the monster mash and most of the taxis and the whores are only taking calls for cash i don't know how it happened it all took place so quick but all i can do is hand it to you and your latest trick my door was standing open security was laid back and lax but it was only my heart got broken you must have had a pass key made out of wax you played robbery with insolence and i played the blues in twelve bars on lover's lane and you never did have the intelligence to use the twelve keys hanging off my chain i don't know how it happened it all took place so quick but all i can do is hand it to you and your latest trick now it's past last call far alcohol past recall has been here and gone the landlord finally paid us all the satin jazzmen have put away their horns and we're standing outside of these wonderlands looking so bereaved and so bereft like a bowery bum when he finally understands the bottle's empty and there's nothing left i don't know how it happened it all took place so quick but all i can do is hand it to you and your latest trick
