like sailin on a sailin ship to nowhere love took over my heart like an ocean breeze as seagulls fly i knew that i was losin love was washed away with the driftin tide oh it's a dirty old shame when all you get from love is a love song that's got you layin up nights just waitin for the music to start it's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song because the best love songs are written with a broken heart and now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding the future that lies before me i cannot see look at look at the future i cannot see although tomorrow i know the sun is rising lighting up the world for everyone but not for me oh it's a dirty old shame when all you get from love is a love song that's got you layin up nights just waitin for the music to start it's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song because the best love songs are written with a broken heart look at look at the future i cannot see oh it's a dirty old shame when all you get from love is a love song all you get from love is an old love song that's got you layin up nights just waitin for the music to start it's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song got to take the blame for an old love song because the best love songs are written with a broken heart repeat x2 oh it's a dirty old shame when all you get from love is a love song all you get from love is an old love song that's got you layin up nights just waitin for the music to start
