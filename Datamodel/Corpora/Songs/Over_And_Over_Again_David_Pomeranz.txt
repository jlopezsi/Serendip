i was walking through the world alone unknown afraid to try again all i ever wanted was to feel somethin real and not say goodbye again ev'ry night beneath the moon i'd pray show me the way though this loneliness then you came into view and from that night i knew i'll love you over and over again i'll hold you close to my heart for every lifetime now and forever i promise you to the end i'll love you over and over again ev'ry time i look into your eyes and you smile it just amazes me how two people made of flesh and bone get to be shown such sweet eternity let the mountains tumble let em fall through it all i'll be by your side and until time grows old with all my heart and soul i'll love you over and over again i'll hold you close to my heart for every lifetime now and forever i promise you to the end i'll love you over and over again i'll love you over and over again i'll hold you close to my heart for every lifetime now and forever i promise you to the end i'll love you over and over and over and over again i'll love you over and over again i'll hold you close to my heart for every lifetime now and forever i promise you to the end i'll love you over and over again
