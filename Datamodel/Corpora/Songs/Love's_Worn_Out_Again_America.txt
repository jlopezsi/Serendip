like you said you'd never get used to it but it's lost that old surprise time comes and goes so quiet now leaves emptiness behind our eyes oh darling if i could spare us from an hour of the pain like you said you'd never get used to it but love's worn out again winter's here bring the blankets out to cover up the cold i'm dreamin of the good night's sleep like i used to know in days of old you told me you felt all alone but you did not tell me when like you said you'd never get used to it but love's worn out again love's worn out again darling it's moved around the bend darling there's no telling when we'll feel it again oh maybe i can't see what's plainly in my view oh i wish i was a better man maybe it's just you but there's something goin on here like a wound that will not mend like you said you'd never get used to it but love's worn out again love's worn out again darling it's moved around the bend darling there's no telling when we'll feel it again love's worn out again darling it's moved around the bend darling there's no telling when we'll feel it again love's worn out again darling it's moved around the bend darling there's no telling when we'll feel it again
