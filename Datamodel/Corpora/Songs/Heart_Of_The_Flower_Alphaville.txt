now at the station the train to another land lands of never seen light light hidden in infinite night night in it's biggest might might of the strongest power and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower i take the first train to the heart of the flower i take the first train to the heart of the flower and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower the waiting room of kingdom come i look back upon my life life of loss but now the end end of rat race overdrive overdrive to foreign lands lands of contemptuous hours and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower now on the train this is the end of my day i feel my spirits escape like a musical clock that's dying away i turn once again and wave my hand and say goodbye i never thought it's so easy i never thought it's so easy i take the first train to the heart of the flower i take the first train to the heart of the flower and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower and there the smoke of the train to the heart of the flower the heart of the flower the heart of the flower the heart of the flower
