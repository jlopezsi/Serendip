this is my home the land of my mother the place i play with sisters and brothers the trees are rooted in the ground beneath take away the violence give the earth back its peace this is our world our common salvation it knows no borders it serves no nation the same sun shines equally on those beneath take away the violence give the earth back its peace there's fire in the ground in the space between the trees in the forests and fields on pathways in dreams the stars are whispering to the ground beneath take away the darkness give the earth back its peace who painted the green grass red with danger who coloured the big sky blue with sorrow a strong wind carrying fear and anger came and went and stole tomorrow this is my home the land of my mother the place i play with sisters and brothers the trees are rooted in the ground beneath take away the violence give the earth back its peace the same sun shines equally on those beneath take away the darkness give the earth back its peace like trees we're rooted in the ground beneath take away the violence give the earth back its peace give the earth back its peace
