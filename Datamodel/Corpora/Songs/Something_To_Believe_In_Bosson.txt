lyrics:bosson music bosson lira gustafsson everybody need something to believe in everybody need something to put their trust in x2 some with luck put their faith in love some show off and let the money talk some look up read the stars above some believe in making dead man walk another year and another week another day time keeps running and everything will be okay x2 chorus everybody need something to believe in everybody need something to put their trust in x2 free believe in what you want free believe in what you want some might say it's a miracle some might call it the destiny some let god lead them all the way some would say they believe in me another year and another week another day time keeps running and everything will be okay x2 chorus
