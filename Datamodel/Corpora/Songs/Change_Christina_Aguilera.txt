when i was young i would look in the mirror didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer yeah i remember being filled with such wonder before learning that the world can be harsher who you love or the colour of your skin or the place that you were born or grew up in shouldn't decide how you should be treated cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing waiting for a change to set us free waiting for the day when you can be you and i can be me waiting for hope to come around waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found waiting for a change waiting for a change change change for all the brave and the souls who went before us stand tall be proud and lift your voices let em know who we are and our choices and one day we won't have to sing this chorus waiting for a change to set us free waiting for the day when you can be you and i can be me waiting for hope to come around waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found waiting for a change waiting for a change change change hold on waiting for a change change when i was young i would look in the mirror didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer
