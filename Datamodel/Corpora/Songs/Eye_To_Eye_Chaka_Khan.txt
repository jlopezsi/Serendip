i'm in the mood to end these empty days ever when i you stare down romancin everytime i see your face hopeless colder than ice with no more flame i think our love has reached the part of no return it?s so sad when lovers don't see eye to eye a look says everything eye to eye so close so far away that distant look is all you've got to say everytime i try to talk to you every word is lost in space drifting further apart in every way we've come to be the ones that love is out of sight it's so clear that we just don't see eye to eye a look says everything eye to eye so close so far away there's no reason for this heartache to go on and on when the feeling?s gone i can say now that it's to late to try and change your mind eye to eye a look says everything eye to eye so close so far away
