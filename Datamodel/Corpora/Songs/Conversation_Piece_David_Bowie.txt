i took this walk to ease my mind to find out what's gnawing at me wouldn't think to look at me that i've spent a lot of time in education it all seems so long ago i'm a thinker not a talker i've no-one to talk to anyway i can't see the road for the rain in my eyes ahhh-huh h uh huh i live above the grocers store owned by an austrian he often calls me down to eat and he jokes about his broken english tries to be a friend to me but for all my years of reading conversation i stand without a word to say i can't see the bridge for the rain in my eyes ahhh-huh h uh huh and the world is full of life full of folk who don't know me and they walk in twos or threes or more while the light that shines above the grocer's store investigates my face so rudely and my essays lying scattered on the floor fulfill their needs just by being there and my hands shake my head hurts my voice sticks inside my throat i'm invisible and dumb no-one will recall me and i can't see the water through the tears in my ey-y-yes ahhh-huh h uh huh
