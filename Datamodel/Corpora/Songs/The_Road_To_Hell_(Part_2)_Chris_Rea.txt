well i'm standing by the river but the water doesn't flow it boils with every poison you can think of and i'm underneath the streetlight but the light of joy i know scared beyond belief way down in the shadows and the perverted fear of violence chokes the smile on every face and common sense is ringing out the bell this ain't no technological breakdown oh no this is the road to hell and all the roads jam up with credit and there's nothing you can do it's all just pieces of paper flying away from you oh look out world take a good look what comes down here you must learn this lesson fast and learn it well this ain't no upwardly mobile freeway oh no this is the road said this is the road this is the road to hell
