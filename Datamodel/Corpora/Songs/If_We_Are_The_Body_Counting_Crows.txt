it's crowded in worship today as she slips in trying to fade into the faces the girls teasing laughter is carying farther than they know farther than they know but if we are the body why aren't his arms reaching why aren't his hands healing why aren't his words teaching and if we are the body why aren't his feet going why is his love not showing them there is a way there is a way a traveler is far away from home he sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row the weight of their judgemental glances tells him that his chances are better out on the road but if we are the body why aren't his arms reaching why aren't his hands healing why aren't his words teaching and if we are the body why aren't his feet going why is his love not showing them there is a way jesus paid much to high a price for us to pick and choose who should come and we are the body of christ if we are the body why aren't his arms reaching why aren't his hands healing why aren't his words teaching and if we are the body why aren't his feet going why is his love not showing them there is a way if we are the body why aren't his arms reaching why aren't his hands healing why aren't his word teaching and if we are the body why aren't his feet going why is his love not showing them there is a way jesus is the way
