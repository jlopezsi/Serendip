i've been romanced and i've been danced crazy nights and hard times life has lost it mystery and love is blind and can not find me cause i'm blowin away and shadows take my love and leave i'm blowin away and shadows keep taking my love and leaving me i have past aside my foolish pride going down for the very last time cause i have searched this earth and sailed the seas but love is blind can not find me chorus x 2
