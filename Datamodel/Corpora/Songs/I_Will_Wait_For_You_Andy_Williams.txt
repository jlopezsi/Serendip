if it takes forever i will wait for you for a thousand summers i will wait for you till you're back beside me till i'm holding you till i hear you sigh here in my arms anywhere you wander anywhere you go every day remember how i love you so in your heart believe what in my heart i know that forevermore i'll wait for you the clock will tick away the hours one by one then the time will come when all the waiting's done the time when you return and find me here and run straight to my waiting arms if it takes forever i will wait for you for a thousand summers i will wait for you till you're here beside me till i'm touching you and forevermore sharing your love
