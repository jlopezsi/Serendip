twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky seems to me you shine your light down to me to say goodnight twinkle twinkle my old friend sleep is waiting round the bend while you travel through the milky way from afar twinkle twinkle twinkle little star raindrops on a window pane stillness of a summer rain silently the haze drifts through the trees slowly dawn is breaking through yet a morning without you curtins rustling in the breeze i'm still trapped within my dreams daylight makes it's way into my mind coming through yet another morning without you finally when darkness falls casting shadows on the walls in the twilight hour i am alone sitting near the fireplace dying embers warm my face in this peaceful solitude all the outside world subdued everything comes backs to me again in the gloom like an angel passing through my room mmm mmm mmm echoes of a voice i knew half awake in half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes so the present runs into the past now and then become entwined playing games within my mind like the embers as they die love was one prolonged goodbye and it all comes back to me tonight in the gloom like an angel passing through my room i close my eyes and my twilight images go by all too soon like an angel passing through my room long awaited darkness falls casting shadows on the walls in the twilight hour i am alone sitting near the fireplace dying embers warms my face in this peaceful solitude all the outside world subdued everything comes back to me again in the gloom like an angel passing through my room half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes so the present runs into the past now and then become entwined playing games within my mind like the embers as they die love was one prolonged goodbye and it all comes back to me tonight in the gloom like an angel passing through my room i close my eyes and my twilight images go by all too soon like an angel passing through my room
