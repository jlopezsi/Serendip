and now that winter's here soon it will be christmas i see your face so clear though you're far away your home is in my heart it's every where i go and i'll be waiting here til you're home to stay i think of winters past when we were together the sweetest memories all come into play your voice rings in my ear just to let me know that you'll be here with me home on christmas day angels calling from on high will bring a starry sky to light the frosted ground below so you will know your way back home tonight a candle burns so bright to show the way i'll make a silent wish just for you this christmas to keep you safe and warm never led astray that everywhere you go is sheltered from the storm and that my christmas wish is with you every day each and every day angels callin down to say they'll always know the way to lift you til you soar so high that i will see you in the sky above my christmas gifts of love will guide you back and now i promise you with all my heart this christmas that all the love we shared will never go away your spirit's everywhere and i hope you know that you are always here home on christmas day home on christmas day
