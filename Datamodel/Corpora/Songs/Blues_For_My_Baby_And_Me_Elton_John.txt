your old man got mad when i told him we were leaving he cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling he called you his child said honey get wise to his game he'll get you in trouble i know it those bums are all the same there's a greyhound outside in the lane it's waiting for us so tell him goodbye we gotta go west on that bus and it's all over now don't you worry no more gonna go west to the sea the greyhound is swaying and the radio is playing some blues for baby and me and the highway looks like it never did lord it looks so sweet and so free and i can't forget that trip to the west singing blues for baby and me saw your hands trembling your eyes opened in surprise it's ninety in the shade babe and there ain't a cloud in the sky i called you my child said honey now this is our game there's two of us to play it and i'm happy to be home again there's a greyhound outside in the lane it's waiting for us so tell him goodbye we gotta go west on that bus
