something like tobacco road living on a lonely road i will pull you out of there we will go to finchley fair i will buy a feather hat i will steal a cricket bat smash some windows make a noise we will run with dirty boys when the sun goes down when the sun goes down and the die is cast when the die is cast and you have no choice we will run with dirty boys we all want men we all want you me and the boys we all go through you've got to learn to hold your tongue they said the moon was his burning son when the sun goes down when the sun goes down and the die is cast when the die is cast and you have no choice we will run with dirty boys
