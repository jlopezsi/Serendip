my stubborn will at last hath yielded i would be thine and thine alone and this the prayer my lips are bringing lord let in me thy will be done chorus sweet will of god still fold me closer til i am wholly lost in thee sweet will of god still fold me closer til i am wholly lost in thee i'm tired of sin footsore and weary the darksome path hath dreary grown but now a light has ris'n to cheer me i find in thee my star my sun chorus thy precious will o conqu'ring savior doth now embrace and compass me the storms have ceased my peace a river my soul a prisoned bird set free chorus
