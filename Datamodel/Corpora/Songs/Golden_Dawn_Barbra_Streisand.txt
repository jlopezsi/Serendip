one golden dawn one summer night with nothing left to say we let the dream begin it was carried on the wind and it wandered away one golden sky one spark of light forever will remain and the song of the storm brought us close kept us warm all alone making love in the rain gone is the world outside home on the turning tide true love will find the sun and know the reason why you make me hunger for you whispered mi amor over the ocean's roar and the night will become our golden dawn two hearts as one no tears to cry with you i have it all if love can never die i'm not afraid to fly but how far must i fall one silver song one lullaby for all the love we make it's the look in your eyes it's the moon on the rise it's the sound of the heart that you break gone is the dark of night call on the early glow send down the birds of love that circle us below and still i will hunger for you whispering mi amor over the ocean's roar and your arms reach for me and the shine on the sea and the night will become our golden dawn
