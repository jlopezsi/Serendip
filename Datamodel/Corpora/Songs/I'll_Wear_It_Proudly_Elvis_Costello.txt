i hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair i hate these strip lights they're not so undoing as your stare i hate the buttons on your shirt when all i want to do is tear i hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here chorus well i finally found someone to turn me upside down and nail my feet up where my head should be if they had a king of fools then i could wear that crown and you can all die laughing because i'll wear it proudly well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm in the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm you have this expression dear no words could take its place and i wear it like a badge that you put all over my face chorus i'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dance halls if you'll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss if you don't know what is wrong with me then you don't know what you've missed we are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight when the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright but in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess and a handful of eagerness says what do you suggest chorus
