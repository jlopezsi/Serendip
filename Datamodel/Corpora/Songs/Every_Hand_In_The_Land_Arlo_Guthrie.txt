words and music arlo guthrie every hand in the land shakes along with me it don't seem that i can dream like i used to dream maybe that somebody is shaking me if i fell i could tell it may be that somebody is making me dream that you're forever gone away from me every toe that i know step away with me i can't seem to get where i want to be maybe it's my own foot that keeps tripping me trip trap flip flap it must come to wherever from it comes through to me i can't walk to where my own dreams talk to me every face in this place take your eyes away blink if you think that there's another way maybe it's my own eyes that don't see the way the time is blind it may come to pass that i will lose my mind i can't live without the love i left behind i can't live without the love i left behind
