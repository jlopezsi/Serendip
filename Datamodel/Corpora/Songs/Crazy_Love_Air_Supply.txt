when you are young the thought of the day is kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules you laugh all the way and grow up so fast that everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last and you smile as it's going past each morning arrives and so much is new you can't wait to share it all with someone just like you the telephone rings and friends come around and talk to the night you see the world start to sing and the fire inside you begins there's nothing like crazy love there's nothing at all watching time all the things that you need so much you can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love you live every day as fast as it comes and don't count the cost because there is no other way these times will change and people must grow but until you do you live the only life that you know and the wild fire lets you go there's nothing like crazy love it comes and it goes leaving you with a feeling you never knew at first it lasts and then it's past it's crazy love there's nothing like crazy love there's nothing at all watching time all the things that you need so much you can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love
