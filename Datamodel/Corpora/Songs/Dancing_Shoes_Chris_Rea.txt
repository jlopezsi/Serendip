could have been a long hot summer night when all the stars were shining bright against the blue could have been that famous decade scene top hats and tails spinning round the room and all i remember is not wanting the music to end and all i remember is feeling a need that i could not hide don't take away those dancing shoes don't take away those dancing shoes don't take away that boy's dancing shoes and ever since that very night i found me a guiding light light the way to turn off the music is to turn off the light in my soul so just let it shine mister one more time for me and my babe don't take away those dancing shoes without the rhythm you got the blues don't take away those dancing shoes don't take away that boy's dancing shoes
