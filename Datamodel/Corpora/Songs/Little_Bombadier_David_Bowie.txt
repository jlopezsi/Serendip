war made him a soldier little frankie mear peace left him a loser the little bombardier lines of worry appeared with age unskilled hands that knew no trade spent his time in the picture house the little bombardier frankie drank his money the little that he made told his woes to no man friendless lonely days then one day in the abc four bright eyes gazed longinly at the ice-cream in the hand of the little bombardier sunshine entered our frankie's days gone his worries his hopeless maze his life was fun and his life was full of joy two young children had changed his aims he gave them toffees and played their games he brought them presents with every coins he made then two gentlemen called him asked him for his name why was he friends with the children were they just a game leave them alone or we'll get sore we've had blokes like you in the station before the hand of authority said no more to the little bombardier packed his bags his heart in pain wiped a tear caught a train not to be seen in the town again
