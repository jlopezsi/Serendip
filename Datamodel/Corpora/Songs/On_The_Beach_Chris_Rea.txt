between the eyes of love i call your name behind those guarded walls i used to go upon a summer wind there's a certain melody takes me back to the place that i know down on the beach the secrets of the summer i will keep the sands of time will blow a mystery no-one but you and i underneath that moonlit sky take me back to the place that i know on the beach forever in my dreams my heart will be hanging on to this sweet memory a day of strange desire and a night that burned like fire take me back to the place that i know on the beach
