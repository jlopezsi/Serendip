time flowing like a river time beckoning me who knows when we shall meet again if ever but time keeps flowing like a river to the sea goodbye my love maybe for forever goodbye my love the tide waits for me who knows when we shall meet again if ever but time keeps flowing like a river on and on to the sea to the sea till it's gone forever gone forever gone forevermore goodbye my friends maybe forever goodbye my friends the stars wait for me who knows where we shall meet again if ever but time keeps flowing like a river on and on to the sea to the sea till it's gone forever gone forever gone forevermore
