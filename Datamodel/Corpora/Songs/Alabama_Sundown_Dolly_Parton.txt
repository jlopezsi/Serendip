the cold december wind seems bent on rockin new york city the town that's got me down to my last dime and everywhere i go the people seem in such a hurry to keep this mobile girl from feelin fine chorus lord what i'd give to see an alabama sundown the sun just seemed to drop in mobile bay new york town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down but that never was the mobile way no no that never was the mobile way a flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar in anybody's town that price is cheap it's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards cause i need ninety cents to go to sleep chorus i felt so big the day i left that mobile couldn't hold me i thought there had to be a better way but if i could find that man that first called lady luck a lady that gentleman would surely learn to pray chorus x2
