lyrics:bosson music bosson going down to the water some time alone some time for my heart and soul when i think of the moment you shed a tear and said i deserve much more you must try to put some faith in yourself i swear to god you are the best a man can get now and forever chorus i love you i love you i love you and i'll show you that it's true i'm crazy about you i love you i love you i love you and you know that it's true i'm crazy about you baby i love you we can find a solution i know it's hard you have to go back in time but when you trust your emotions then let me in i'll give you this heart of mine you must try to put some faith in yourself i swear to god you are the best a man can get now and forever chorus when you wake up in the morning i love you when you come home in the evening i want you when you are angry and shouting i need you when i find you with another i love you chorus
