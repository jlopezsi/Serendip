from the day we arrive on the planet and blinking step into the sun there's more to be seen than can ever be seen more to do than can ever be done some say eat or be eaten some say live and let live but all are agreed as they join the stampede you should never take more than you give chorus in the circle of life it's the wheel of fortune it's the leap of faith it's the band of hope till we find our place on the path unwinding in the circle the circle of life some of us fall by the wayside and some of us soar to the stars and some of us sail through our troubles and some have to live with the scars there's far too much to take in here more to find than can ever be found but the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky keeps great and small on the endless round chorus x2 on the path unwinding in the circle the circle of life
