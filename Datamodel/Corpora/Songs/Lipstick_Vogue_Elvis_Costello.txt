don't say you love me when it's just a rumor don't say a word if there is any doubt sometimes i think that love is just a tumor you've got to cut it out you say you're sorry for the things that you've done you say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it i wouldn't worry i had so much fun sometimes i almost feel just like a human being it's you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue it's you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue oh yeah get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival just hit me one more time with that live wire maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million you say i've got no feelings this is a good way to kill them select the control and then insert the token you want to throw me away but i'm not broken you've got a lot to say well i'm not joking there are some words they don't allow to be spoken sometimes i almost feel just like a human being it's you not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
