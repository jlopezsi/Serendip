this is a man's world this is a man's world but it wouldn't be nothing nothing without a woman or a girl you see man made the cars to take us over the road man made the trains to carry heavy loads man made electric light to take us out of the dark man made the boat for the water like noah made the ark this is a man's world this is a man's world but it wouldn't be nothing nothing without a woman or a girl man thinks about little baby boy and baby girl man makes them happy cause man makes them toys and after man has made everything everything he can you know that man makes money to buy from other man this is a man's world but it wouldn't be nothing nothing without a woman or a girl he's lost in the wilderness he's lost in bitterness
