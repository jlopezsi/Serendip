i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play the guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder and any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re-stacks is what the speakers play i'll be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites and we needed to breathe we used each other's air just for the people to see and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep we go anywhere our minds would take us and also you are beautiful without your make-up and you don't even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way god made us and time's the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face in the cold taking day trips to the local where we eat on the road cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits and if we were two rabbits and then you vanish back to burgh with all the celtics i'd dissapear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job before everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane but in the day we'll have to say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me nina oh won't you leave me now now love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back oh won't you leave me now oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now
