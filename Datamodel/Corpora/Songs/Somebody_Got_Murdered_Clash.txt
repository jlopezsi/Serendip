someone lights a cigarette while riding in a car some ol guy takes a swig and passes back the jar but where they were last night no-one can remember somebody got murdered goodbye for keeps forever somebody got murdered somebody's dead forever and you're minding your own business carrying spare change you wouldn't cosh a barber you're hungry all the same i been very tempted to grab it from the till i been very hungry but not enough to kill somebody got murdered his name cannot be found a small stain on the pavement they'll scrub it off the ground as the daily crown disperses no-one says that much somebody got murdered and it left me with a touch somebody got murdered somebody's dead forever sounds like murder those shouts are they drunk down below it's late and my watch stopped some time ago sounds like murder those screams are they drunk down below
