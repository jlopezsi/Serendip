don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart love blooms at night in daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes or keep your heart from me for some day i'll return and you know you're the only one i'll ever love too many miles too many days too many nights to be alone please keep your heart while we are apart don't linger in the moonlight while i'm gone too many miles too many days too many nights to be alone oh please keep your heart while we are apart don't stand in the moonlight while i'm gone don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart love blooms at night in daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes or keep your heart from me for some day i'll return and you know you're the only one i'll ever love too many miles too many days don't let the stars get in your eyes
