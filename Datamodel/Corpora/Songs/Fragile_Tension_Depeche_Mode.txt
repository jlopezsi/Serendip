well it's a fragile tension that's keeping us going it may not last forever but oh when it's flowing there's something magical in the air some things so tragic we have to care it's a strange obsession that's's drawing us nearer we don't understand it it never gets clearer there's something mystical in our genes so simplistic it kicks and screams oh when we're teetering on the edge of the collapse nothing can keep us down it's a dizzying feeling that's keeping us flying some glittering galas without even trying there's something radical in our hands nothing logical to our plans
