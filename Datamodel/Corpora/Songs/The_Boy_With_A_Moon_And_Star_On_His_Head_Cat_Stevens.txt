a gardener's daughter stopped me on my way on the day i was to wed it is you who i wish to share my body with she said we'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed and for my joy i will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun her hands were like the white sands and her eyes had diamonds on we left the road and headed up to the top of the whisper wood and we walked till we came to where the holy magnolia stood and there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love with the naked earth beneath us and the universe above the time was late my wedding wouldn't wait i was sad but i had to go so while she was asleep i kissed her cheek for cheerio the wedding took place and people came from many miles around there was plenty merriment cider and wine abound but out of all that i recall i remembered the girl i met cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget a year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before as if was a year before until the gift that someone left a basket by my door and in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed i got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head as years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe they'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before and people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread i'll tell you everything i've learned and love is all he said
