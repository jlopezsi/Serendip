we're walking in the air we're floating in the moonlit sky the people far below are sleeping as we fly i'm holding very tight i'm riding in the midnight blue i'm finding i can fly so high above with you far across the world the villages go by like dreams the rivers and the hills the forests and the streams children gaze open mouthed taken by surprise nobody down below believes their eyes we're surfing in the air we're swimming in the frozen sky we're drifting over icy mountains floating by suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep and walking in the air we're dancing in the midnight sky and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly we're walking in the air we're walking in the air
