why does the gay little dicky bird sing what put the zing in a butterfly's wing what's the reason for the smile of a troubadour why does a breeze have a barrel of fun even the bee who's a son-of-a-gun it's all because they're free and stringless the same as me i've got no strings to hold me down to make me fret or make me frown i had strings but now i'm free there are no strings on me hi-o the merri-o i'm as happy as can be i want the world to know nothing ever worries me i've got no strings so i have fun i'm not tied up to anyone how i love my liberty there are no strings on me i've got no strings so i have fun i'm not tied up to anyone how i love my liberty there are no strings on me
