two am where do i begin crying off my face again the silent sound of loneliness wants to follow me to bed i'm a ghost of a girl that i want to be most i'm the shell of a girl that i used to know well dancing slowly in an empty room can the lonely take the place of you i sing myself a quiet lullaby let you go and let the lonely in to take my heart again too afraid to go inside for the pain of one more loveless night for the loneliness will stay with me and hold me till i fall asleep i'm a ghost of a girl that i want to be most i'm the shell of a girl that i used to know well dancing slowly in an empty room can the lonely take the place of you i sing myself a quiet lullaby let you go and let the lonely in to take my heart again broken pieces of a barely breathing story where there once was love now there's only me and the lonely dancing slowly in an empty room can the lonely take the place of you i sing myself a quiet lullaby let you go and let the lonely in to take my heart again
