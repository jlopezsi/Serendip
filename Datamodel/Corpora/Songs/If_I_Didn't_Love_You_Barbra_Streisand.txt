if i didn't love you i'd be safe from harm i would never find myself lost inside your arms if i didn't love you i'd never feel the pain of sunny days without you drowning in the rain if i didn't love you if i didn't love you peace would rule the day all the dark and out would surely go away if i didn't love you i wouldn't pay the cost of living every endless day if our love is lost if i didn't love you if i didn't love you and yet you make me breathless at the way you move i never knew that i could ever love the way we do i don't know how you reach me in that place in my heart belonging to only you if i didn't love you i wouldn't lose control the danger loving brings a word never touch my soul if i didn't love you perhaps i wouldn't die if you should ever say to me i'm sorry goodbye if i didn't love you how can there be music in the way you touch i can't believe that somehow i believe in you so much now you've come and taught me how to give you my heart and make me feel at last that the end will never start you're the only reason i'm not afraid to fall for if i didn't love you if i didn't love you i wouldn't love at all
