ten years ago on a cold dark night someone was killed beneath the townhall light there were few at the scene but they all agreed that the slayer who ran looked a lot like me she walks these hills in a long black veil she visits my grave when the night winds wail nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me the judge said son what is your aliby if you were somewhere else then you won't have to die i said not a word though it meant my life for i'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife oh she walks these hills in a long black veil she visits my grave when the night winds wail nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me oh now the scaffold is high eternity is near she stood in the crowd and shed not a tear and sometimes at night when the cold winds blow in a long black veil she cries over my bones she walks these hills in a long black veil she visits my grave when the night winds wail nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me oh she walks these hills in a long black veil she visits my grave when the night winds wail nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me nobody knows nobody knows but me nobody knows but me
