thunder cracks the sky is crying on her back she's pushing trying he holds her hand and kneels beside her bed break the silence baby screaming in slow motion she ain't dreaming she closed her eyes looked up to god and says chorus should i cry a little more should i try a little more i'd pay the cost and laugh it off i'd do it all a thousand times again no regrets living's hard and dying's easy my mistakes they won't defeat me i like to burn the candle at both ends i've broke some hearts been broken hearted i've run away from fires i've started i didn't break but tried my best to bend chorus should i cry a little more should i try a little more i'd pay the cost and laugh it off i'd do it all a thousand times again no regrets no regrets-for things i've done no regrets-for wars i've won no regrets-for fires i've started no regrets-for faith departed should i cry a little more should i die a little more should i lie a little more should i get high a little more should i cry a little more should i try a little more i'd pay the cost and laugh it off i'd do it all a thousand times again no regrets
