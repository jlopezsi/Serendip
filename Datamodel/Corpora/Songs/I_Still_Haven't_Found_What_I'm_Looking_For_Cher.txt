i have climbed highest mountain i have run through the fields only to be with you only to be with you i have run i have crawled well i have scaled these city walls these city walls only to be with you but i still haven't found what i'm looking for but i still haven't found what i'm looking for well i have kissed honey lips felt the healing fingertips it burned like fire this burning desire i have spoke tongue of angels and i have held hand of the devil it was warm in the night i was cold as a stone but i still haven't found what i'm looking for but i still haven't found what i'm looking for i believe in the kingdom come when all the colors bleed into one bleed into one and yes i'm still running you broke the bonds and you loosed the chains carried the cross of my shame of my shame and you know i believed it but i still haven't found what i'm looking for but i still haven't found what i'm looking for but i still haven't found what i'm looking for but i still haven't found what i'm looking for what i'm looking for what i'm looking for what i'm looking for what i'm looking for
