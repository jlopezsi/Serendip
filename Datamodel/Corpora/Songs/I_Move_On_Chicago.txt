catherine zeta-jones while truckin down the road of life although all hope seems gone i just move on renee zellweger when i can't find a single star to hang my wish upon i just move on i move on catherine zeta-jones i run so fast a shotgun blast can hurt me not one bit renee zellweger i'm on my toes cause heaven knows a movin target's hard to hit both so as we play an ex-ballet we're not the dyin swan we just move on we move on renee zellweger just when it seems we're out of dreams and things have got us down catherine zeta-jones we don't despair we don't go there we hang our bonnets out of town both so there's no doubt we're well cut out to run life's marathon we just move on we just move on so light of foot we can't stay put we just move on yes we move on
