soft breeze whispering trees the summer winds are sighing the leaves are lullabying violins are all around you i can hear the chords resound of sounding brass that seems to say i've found i've found you i've found you strange music in my ears only now as you spoke did it start strange music of the sphere could its lovely hum be coming from my heart you appear and i hear song sublime song that i'm incapable of so dear let me hold you near while we treasure ev'ry measure so that time can never change the strange new music of love so dear let me hold you near while we treasure ev'ry measure so that time can never change the strange new music of love
