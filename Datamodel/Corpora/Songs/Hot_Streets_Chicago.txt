hot streets down below me all the people moving slowly as they search each other's faces for a trace of hope concealed beneath their laughter and it's only love they're after mountains lie before me skies ahead are looking stormy as the highway driver braces for a race with time to reach a destination of his own imagination a child of the sky a rider on the wind i can fly a prisoner of time a dimensional crime lost am i winter stars above me with a woman who can love me and moonlight swept embraces fill my space with joy and peace the sweet vibrations of a lover's celebration
