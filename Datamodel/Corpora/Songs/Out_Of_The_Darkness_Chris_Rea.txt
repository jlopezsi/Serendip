there's an empty street in an empty town there's an old boutique selling ageing gowns some words on the walls that were written by the light of the moon so bright can you hear me can you her me tonight take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light the rain that falls doesn't make me cry and the wind that blows cannot hurt my eyes but the things that i see when i turn on tv make me want to lie down and die can you hear me can you her me tonight take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light can you hear me take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light
