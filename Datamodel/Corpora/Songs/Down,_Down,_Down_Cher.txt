every now and then i begin again i push the rock up the mountain though i'm learning slow now i think i know how to step aside when the rock begins to slide chorus down down down to the bottom of the valley down down down but i know it won't crush me anymore every now and then i think i see a friend i push the rock up the mountain ah getting close to what i never knew i just step aside when the rock begins to slide chorus love's not a simple thing if you're all alone and finding someone to care and when you reach him he's not there it slides chorus here i go again faith has time to lend i push the rock up the mountain hope it won't be just another joke on me but i just step aside if the rock begins to slide chorus x2
