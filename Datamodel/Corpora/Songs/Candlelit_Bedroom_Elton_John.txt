the sound of one heart breaking the sound of someone waking to the cold hard truth before the sun goes down if i could ever catch you a little bit of that i'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground on the ledge with one last chance to beg to the deepest root of the oldest tree if we could only bottle a little bit of rain wrung out from the history in it's ancient leaves chorus all we need is a candlelit bedroom all you ever wanted was a state of grace every waking moment you believe that love will always lead you to a better place the never ending stories of the victor and the spoils the treasure and the lesson to be learned if i could ever wrap up a little piece of this i'd strike a match and watch the contents burn chorus x2 love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom only if you want it bad enough every waking moment you believe that you must have a little faith in the light of love every waking moment you believe that you must have a little faith in the light of love
