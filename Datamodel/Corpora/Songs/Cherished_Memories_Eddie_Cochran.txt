you're goin away away from me but here in my heart is a memory the way we met the way we kissed the way we fell in love oh the little secrets that we shared when i was sad the way you cared to let me know you'd understand the way you'd hold my hand cherished memories the things that a fellow can't forget cherished memories you're leaving but i love you yet and now you say that we must part and even though it breaks my heart there's one thing you can't take from me that's my cherished memories
