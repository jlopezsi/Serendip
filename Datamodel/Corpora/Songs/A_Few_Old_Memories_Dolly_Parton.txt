just a few old memories slipped in through my door though i thought i had closed it so tightly before i can't understand it why it should bother my mind for it all belongs to another place and time just a few old keep-sakes way back on the shelf no they don't mean nothin well i'm surprised they're still left just a few old love letters with the edges all brown and an old faded picture i keep turned upside-down just a few old memories going way back in time well i can hardly remember i don't know why i'm cryin i can't understand it well i'm surprised myself first thing tomorrow morning i'll clean off that shelf just a few old keep-sakes way back on the shelf no they don't mean nothin well i'm surprised that they're left just a few old love letters with their edges all brown and an old faded picture i keep turned upside-down
