i've dance alone a thousand times to songs that no one else could even hear i've reached into the flame of love i couldn't hold it and it disappeared i've lived to learn to hate the blues i've lived with everything but you i can't believe my eyes i see you here lookin just the way you should ooh so good it's too good to be true i lived my life to be lyin here with you ooh i can't believe my eyes i've felt the empty hands of time as they were stealin all my life away i've heard the silence here inside waiting for words that lovers could not say you turn a little into stone with every night you spend alone i can't believe my eyes i see you here lookin just the way you should ooh so good it's too good to be true i lived my life to be lyin here with you ooh still when i see you lyin here i can't believe my eyes
