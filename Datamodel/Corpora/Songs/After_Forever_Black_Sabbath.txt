have you ever thought about your soul can it be saved or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave is god just a thought within your head or is he a part of you is christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school when you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope do you think he's a fool well i have seen the truth yes i've seen the light and i've changed my ways and i'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say if they knew you believe in god above they should realize before they criticize that god is the only way to love is your mind so small that you have to fall in with the pack wherever they run will you still sneer when death is near and say they may as well worship the sun i think it was true it was people like you that crucified christ i think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced will you be so sure when your day is near say you don't believe you had the chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve perhaps you'll think before you say that god is dead and gone open your eyes just realize that he's the one the only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate or will you still jeer at all you hear yes i think it's too late
