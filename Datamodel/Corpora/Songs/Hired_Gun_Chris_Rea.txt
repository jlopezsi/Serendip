morning light meet the day nervous eyes look both ways and it just won't matter spring or fall there's bread to win and shots to call and there ain't nobody out there just a wild uncertainty it's in your stride but it ain't no fun sometimes i feel just like a hired gun i feel just like a hired gun always on the run and how it started well you can't recall did someone push you did someone stall whatever the reasons there was lots to learn to get home safely and not get burned and it's all so cold and empty as you watch the setting sun you've picked up every dirty trick just to keep yourself always on the run and i feel just like a hired gun always on the run i dream of comfort and friendship long but i can't trust you or anyone the scars still hurt me and i don't let them heal each one's a lesson each one's a shield and i may even love you dearly and i loathe what i have to do you see i've picked up every dirty trick in my fear of you cause you make me feel just like a hired gun always on the run
