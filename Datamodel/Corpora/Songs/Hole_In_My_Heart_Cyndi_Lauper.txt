i've got a ticket no turning back my destination the sea of trouble the land of pain you're sending me where it always rains oh reconsider i'm begging you some hesitation i'm holding on to my sanity i feel the beginning of emergency my hands are slipping oh please don't let me fall into chorus this hole in my heart that goes all the way to china you gotta fill it up with love before i fall inside of this empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to china and though you can't see the bottom believe me it's a long way down i'm on a planet without a plan it's oh so lonely i need to see you to get out of here there's something deadly in this atmosphere i'm in a desert without a drink of your sweet water you're my oasis in the burning sand i'm out of danger when you touch my hand throw me a lifeline i'm standing on the edge of chorus the gun was loaded i didn't know i pulled the trigger i heard a noise then the room went dark i felt the bullet going in my heart i feel so dizzy oh please don't let me fall don't leave me in chorus i've got a hole in my heart you've got to fill it up with love
