when i was a younger i used to dream a lot staring into my coffee about how you'd love me and write me poetry and want to be with me yeah well momma done told me you might wander far yeah but nobody warned me the road would own your heart and so i'm saying if you have to go away i will be waiting by the phone and if you have to go away i'll put your records on pretend you're still at home now that i'm older i sit at home a lot with the kid we've got yeah the radio's playing he really loves his wife i hear the d.j saying well momma done told me you might wander far oh as long as you hold me more than you hold that guitar i'll keep on saying if you have to go away i'll leave your shoes beside the bed and if you have to go away i'll want to be with you i'll be with me instead if you have to go away i won't be sleeping very well but if you have to go away i'll be loving you till it's cold in hell maybe you'll write me this time maybe you'll call on a static line saying don't you ever worry your pretty mind cause you and me are gonna be fine and so i'm saying if you have to go away i will be waiting by the phone and if you have to go away i'll put your records on pretend you're still at home if you have to go away i'll leave your shoes beside the bed and if you have to go away i'll want to be with you i'll be with me instead if you have to go away i won't be sleeping very well but if you have to go away i'll be loving you i'll be loving you if you have to go away
