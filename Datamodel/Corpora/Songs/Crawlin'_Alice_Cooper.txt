your dress is hangin on a hook on the door my jeans are lying in a pile on the floor yeah flat on my back tryin to catch my breath when we were rockin tonight i thought that we were gonna rock to death but what's that in your eyes i'm no longer paralyzed here we go again crawlin you come crawling to me i go crawling to you we come crawling you come crawling to me i go crawling to you your hair is tangled and your lipstick is gone you're stretched out calling my name with just your high heels on we hunt each other on our hands and our knees well i'm an alley cat and you're a hot little siamese but what's that in your eyes i'm no longer paralyzed here we go again crawlin you come crawling to me i go crawling to you we come crawling you come crawling to me i go crawling to you
