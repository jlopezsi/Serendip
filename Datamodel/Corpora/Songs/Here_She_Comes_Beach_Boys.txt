here she comes breathing life in to my thoughts there she goes leaves a portrait in my soul rolling in madness she does everything to me wherever she goes you know the devil dances and the gods lay down in defeat am i living crazy woman can't you see that i'm giving giving to you can you dig me i want to live to learn the truth before my door don't you know i'm a simple man for all i know this might be the hard way but it's easier for me to take all the changes that are always amazin but to never let em fence me in am i living crazy woman can't you see that i'm giving giving to you can you dig me me i'm only searchin for the things i really need i can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds i started out on empty promise i was living on my dreams i was a runaway son and now i'm up out of the water and i can barely barely breathe rolling down the road rolling down the road rolling down the road rolling down the road rolling down the road listen listen hear the music play listen listen hear the music play yeah listen listen hear the music play listen listen hear the music play am i living crazy woman can't you see that i'm giving giving to you can you dig me
