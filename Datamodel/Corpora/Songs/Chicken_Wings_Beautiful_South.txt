well i always knew you'd take the crutches and not the skis 1 always knew you'd take the stilts and then your knees when god gave you the sky i knew you'd take the trees son you've grown those chicken wings you just can't fly they anchored our dream yacht to ocean bed chained our ideal home to bicycle shed clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree we could've courted einstein could've courted marx we could've gone for strolls like other families do in parks son you were born a dud in a family without sparks yes you've got those chicken wings you just can't fly the checkered flag that losers despise never flew in our port or harbored in our eyes cause we always formed that queue for second prize this family's got those chicken wings we just can't fly our winning tickets ripped up into shreds the tale of this family is its heads we're bouncing on a pogo stick without any springs it hurts me to admit this but we've got those chicken wings yes you've got those chicken wings and all the luggage that the failure brings is a swallow flying high that sings look he's got those chicken wings he may as well die
