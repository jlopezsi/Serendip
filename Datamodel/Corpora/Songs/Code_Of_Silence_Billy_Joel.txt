everybody's got a million questions everybody wants to know the score what you went through it's something you should be over now everybody wants to hear the secrets that you never told a soul before and it's not that strange because it wouldn't change what happened anyhow but you swore to yourself a long time ago there were some things that people never needed to know guess there's one that you keep that you bury so deep no one can tear it out and you can't talk about it because you're following a code of silence you're never gonna to lose the anger you just deal with it a different way and you can't talk about it and isn't that a kind of madness to be living by a code of silence when you've really got a lot to say you don't want to lose a friendship there's nothing that you have to hide and a little dirt couldn't hurt no one anyway and you still have a rage inside you that you carry with a certain pride in the only part of the broken heart that you could ever save but you've been through it once you know how it ends you don't see the point of going through it again and this ain't the place and this ain't the time and neither's any other day so you can't talk about it because you're following a code of silence you're never gonna to lose the anger you just deal with it a different way so you can't talk about it and isn't that a kind of madness to be living by a code of silence when you've really got a lot to say i know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons that's not the kind of code you're inclined to break some things unknown are best left alone forever and if a vow is what it takes haven't you paid for your mistakes after the moment passes and the impulse disappears you can still hold back because you don't crack very easily it's a time honored resolution because the danger is always near it's with you now but that ain't how it was supposed to be and it's hard to believe after all these years that it still gives you pain and it still brings tears and you feel like a fool because it's part of your rules you've got a memory but you can't talk about it because you're following a code of silence you're never gonna to lose the anger you just deal with it a different way but you can't talk about it and isn't that a kind of madness to be living by a code of silence when you've really got a lot to say
