we've got our little fingers workin hard on the trains and dolls and cars hurryin cause santa's a-waitin soldiers marchin out the door carryin the toys galore for santa's reindeer ride this is more than just another reindeer ride not a practice run in july we've got to load up all the festive gear peace and hope and yuletide cheer for santa's reindeer ride polish the runners shine rudolph's nose tighten the harness brush off the snow we'd love to sing our little working songs wish that we could tag along just to see the children's faces tonight the world is filled with joy deeper than the games and toys it's time to load up the sleigh tonight the world is filled with joy deeper than the games and toys it's time to load up the sleigh it's time to load up the sleigh for santa's reindeer ride
