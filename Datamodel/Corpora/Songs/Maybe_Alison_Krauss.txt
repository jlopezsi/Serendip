yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations flyin above the rest never fallin from the nest tuesday came and went and now i'm in a little situation maybe it's for the best i can live alone i guess chorus maybe i can stand alone maybe i'm strong as stone even though the bird has flown maybe he'll fly on home forgive me if i'm keeping you apart from better conversation i'm hung up on all my doubt trying to sort the whole thing out tell me that i'm smart enough to deal with all the information spinning inside my head every word he ever said chorus x2
