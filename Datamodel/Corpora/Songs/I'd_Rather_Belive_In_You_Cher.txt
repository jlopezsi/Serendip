i'd rather belive in you writers thom mchugh bruce miller i should go out tonight and get on with my life break these chains of solitude a little luck and a little help i might even find myself in the arms of someone new but once you've loved somebody it ain't that easy to do once you've somebody like i've loved you look what you've gone and done you've ruined it for anyone who tries to steal this heart away i can't get you off my mind i've told myself a million times a little time is all it takes but once you've loved somebody it ain't that easy to do once you've somebody like i've loved you i gave you everything that i had to give i don't know if i can go that far again but once you've loved somebody it ain't that easy to do once you've somebody like i've loved you oh once you've loved somebody oh like i've loved you
