there was backstreets of birmingham taking my clothes and my food and a trash can sleeping in alleys at night making love to a bottle of wine cause you know life is to succeed but that was back when judy loved me somewhere in yesterday seems a million miles away back in the days judy used to beg me to take her away but i was too young and livin was fun i didn't know how time would change me life slid by me too fast the fun didn't last it's too late to get back to the days when judy loved me riding a freight train goin nowhere don't use mirrors anymore they show my grey hair giving my place in the welfare line trading my soup for a bottle of wine cause you know life is to succeed but that was back when judy loved me somewhere in yesterday seems a million miles away back in the days judy used to beg me to take her away but i was too young and livin was fun i didn't know how time would change me life slid by me too fast the fun didn't last it's too late to get back to the days when judy loved me back when judy loved me back when judy loved me
