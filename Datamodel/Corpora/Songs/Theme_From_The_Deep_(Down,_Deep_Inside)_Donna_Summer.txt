down deep inside there's a place in me i'm yearning to explore look in my eyes and remember wine the music and amour the days grow stronger and longer with every glance it's what a stare and the dance were to find romance while dancers dance so close deep inside to our dream of dreams our theme of themes romance yes i'm falling watch me falling something warm is turning inside of me something warm is burning inside of me
