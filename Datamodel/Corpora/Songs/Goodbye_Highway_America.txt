in this world of lost horizons where your dreams burn fast but your nights go slower ever find that you're compromising all your hopes and fears just to get to know her so you take a walk down the goodbye highway the hello goodbye way it's a long long road ever take a stroll down the goodbye highway the some other time way try to ease your load she was never one for social graces and hangin out with the midnight faces wore me out i guess the thoughts of the nights alone or the time waiting for the telephone removed the doubt so we took a ride down the goodbye highway the hello goodbye way it's the longest road soon you're fighting over the yours or my way the do or die way's the only way you know so you stand up for the things that you're losing out on but it's all so confusing you hold on but it slips right through your hands guess it's so long with a change of direction goodbye gotta make my connection solo as you head on out the door forever more so you take a walk down the goodbye highway the hello goodbye way it's a one way road ever find yourself down the goodbye highway the some other time way nowhere left to go nowhere left to go
