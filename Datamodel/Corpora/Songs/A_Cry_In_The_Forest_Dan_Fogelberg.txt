there's a cry in the forest it's feathered and brown and it echoes off of nothing as the trees come down it's the sound of a sparrow hittin the ground it's the sound of one eternity bound it's the sound of one eternity bound there's a cry in the oceans it's plaintive and blue and it rises from the depths breaks my heart in two it's the dreams of the great whales running aground for they know that they're eternity bound for they know that they're eternity bound whoa eternity bound once they've passed into the timeless they can never more be found is there anybody listening tell me can you hear the sound of the gentle ones eternity bound of the gentle ones eternity bound there's a cry in the heart of every woman and man we've been crying in the darkness since the world began will we ever seek forgiveness will we ever earn the crown or are we in turn eternity bound or are we in turn eternity bound whoa eternity bound once we've past into the timeless we can never more be found is there anybody listening tell me can you hear the sound of the lonely ones eternity bound of the lonely ones eternity bound of the lonely ones eternity bound
