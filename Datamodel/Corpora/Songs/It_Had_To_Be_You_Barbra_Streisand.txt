seems like dreams like i always had could be should be making me glad why am i blue it's up to you to explain i'm thinking maybe baby i'll go away someday some way you'll come and say it's you i need and you'll be pleading in vain it had to be you had to be you i wondered around finally found somebody who could make me be true could make me be blue and even be glad just to be sad thinking of you some others i've seen might never be mean might never be cross i tried to be boss but they wouldn't do cause nobody else gave ma a thrill with all your faults i love you still had to be you crazy old you had to be you
