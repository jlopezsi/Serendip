every night i lay my head on my pillow on my bed and i just cry myself to sleep i know i shouldn't cry over words that were all lies but still i cry myself to sleep each night i fight the tears but still they fall and all the memories linger on he's gone he's gone and now there's nothing but to cry cry myself to sleep still i cry myself to sleep each night i fight those tears but still they fall and all the memories linger on he's gone he's gone he's gone and now there's nothing but to cry ah cry myself to sleep ah cry myself to sleep ah cry myself to sleep
