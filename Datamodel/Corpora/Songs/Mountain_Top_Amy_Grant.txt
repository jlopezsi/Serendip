i love to sing and i love to pray worship the lord most every day i go to the temple and i just want to stay to hide from the hustle of the world and its ways and i'd love to live on a mountain top fellowshipping with the lord i'd love to stand on a mountain top cause i love to feel my spirit soar but i've got to come down from that mountain top to the people in the valley below or they'll never know that they can go to the mountain of the lord now praising the father is a good thing to do to worship the trinity in spirit and truth but if we worshiped all of the time there would be no one to lead the blind but i'd love to live on a mountain top fellowshipping with the lord i'd love to stand on a mountain top cause i love to feel my spirit soar but i've got to come down from that mountain top to the people in the valley below or they'll never know that they can go to the mountain of the lord now i am not saying that worship is wrong but worship is more than just singin a song it's all that you say and everything that you do it's letting his spirit live through you still i'd love to live on a mountain top fellowshipping with the lord i'd love to stand on a mountain top cause i love to feel my spirit soar but i've got to come down from that mountain top to the people in the valley below or they'll never know that they can go to the mountain of the lord
