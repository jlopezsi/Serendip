i once held her in my arms she said she would always stay but i was cruel and i treated her like a fool i threw it all away once i had mountains in the palm of my hand and rivers to drink through everyday but i must have been mad i never knew what i had until i threw it all away love is all there is that makes the world go round love as only love can't be denied not matter what you think about it just won't be able to do without it take a tip from one who's tried so when you find someone who gives you all of her love take it to your heart don't let is stray cause one thing for certain you will surely be hurting if you throw it all away if you throw it all away
