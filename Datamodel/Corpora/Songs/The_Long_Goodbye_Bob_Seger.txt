the silent fall of evening snow another thing you can't control does it chill or warm you soul tonight you've become a mystery will i earn your honesty i'll never know if we agree if you're not here and we travel separate roads and we carry different loads and in the end we stay or go the long goodbye continues on through fog and rain and far beyond you stay awhile and then you're gone again i look into your restless eyes you turn away it's no surprise i wonder if it's even wise but i'm still here
