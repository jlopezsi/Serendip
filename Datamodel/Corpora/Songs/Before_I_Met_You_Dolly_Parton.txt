i thought i had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before i met you i never saw one that i wanted for mine but that was before i met you i thought i was swinging the world by the tail i thought i could never be blue i thought i'd been kissed and i thought i'd been loved but that was before i met you i thought i'd stay single always be free but that was before i met you i said that no sweet thang could ever hold me but that was before i met you i thought i was swinging the world by the tail i thought i could never be blue i thought i'd been kissed and i thought i'd been loved but that was before i met you that was before i met you
