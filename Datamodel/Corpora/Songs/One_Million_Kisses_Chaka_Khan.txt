if i could only shake the hand of time cause time has been good to us bringin us closer together i know our love is of a special kind a real everlasting love that keeps getting better and better chorus night after night night after night day after day the closer we get with every minute just tickin away our love has come to see maturity and from the very day we said hello i washed out our love for all one million kisses later our love is so much greater one million kisses after we share more love than laughter we've been through a lot together you and i but time has been good to us givin us so much to treasure so many tomorrows we have left behind the future becomes harsh but this kind of love will last forever chorus
