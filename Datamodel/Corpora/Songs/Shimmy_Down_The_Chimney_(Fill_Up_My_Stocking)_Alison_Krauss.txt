tonight i waited but my heart is so cold cause you never stay more than a minute so i'm told i know you're just doing your job but what am i supposed to do when all i want for christmas darling is to be with you i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby i watch you fill up my stocking but when i offer you some christmas greetings you just keep on walking yeah i'm not asking for a miracle just a night and if you just look in my eyes you just might there'll be no other woman who'll treat you like i can come on over here i'll be your loving darling you'll be my loving man oh i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby i watch you fill up my stocking but when i offer you some christmas greetings you just keep on walking i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby i watch you fill up my stocking but when i offer you some christmas greetings you just keep on walking keep on walking i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby you just keep on walking i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby i watch you fill up my stocking i watch you shimmy down the chimney baby
