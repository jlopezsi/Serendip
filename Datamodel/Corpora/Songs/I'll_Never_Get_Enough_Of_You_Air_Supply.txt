all last night we lay in bed making love i never felt so much before with anyone never had to say a word it was all right there the warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere and if i never have another love well at least i had last night now i know how the feeling grows cause you made me come alive chorus i'll never get enough never get enough never get enough of you i'll never get enough never get enough never get enough of you i only want to give you more now you're gone i'm all alone just lying here waiting for the moment when i'll feel you near never asked if you'd come back i was too damn proud i just smile and touched your hair as you went out chorus
