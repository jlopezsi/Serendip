ah ha ah gonna let you go my angel though i could make you stay i could use my blind self-pity throw it in your way but the times have turned between us and you know i don't believe that it makes one bit of difference if you stay or if you leave why can't i be lonely like that lonely rushing river pushing down a mountain on it's way to meet the sea why can't i need somebody like that river needs that ocean why did you have to get so mixed up baby with a mixed up girl with a mixed up girl like me yeah gonna make it short now angel though i could make it long i could take through all the changes and show you where you're wrong but our dreams don't flow together and you'll never never see the light so it really really doesn't matter who is wrong or who is right oh why can't i be lonely like that lonely rushing river it's pushing down the mountain on its way to meet the sea oh why can't i need somebody like that river needs that ocean why did you have to get so mixed up baby with a mixed up girl with a mixed up girl like me mmm oh mmm oh
