when i first saw you you looked alien like someone in mid dance like a little old man when you first held me in your tiny grip you seemdd just like popeye with your cap and your souint chorus shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way and i'll take this old man by the hand to begin again to begin again when i first looked into eyes like mine i wondered what i learn to see through them in time when you first smiled with your toothless grin you broke my heart break open all the flood gates rushed in chorus shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way and i'll take this old man by the hand to begin again to begin again
