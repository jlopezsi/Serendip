chorus all clear wail the sirens sunshine on the wasteland old man sitting in the white sand think we're in for a big surprise right between the eyes seemed a good idea to drop a bomb on the wasteland here only one man could be seen and he was old and so serene captain sat in his deck chair and the red light flashed beware pilot felt quite big-time as the bomb sailed through the air well they danced and sang when the bang went bang when the lights popped out and the smoke began to clear it was positively queer chorus die said the general cobblers said the man so the pentagon sent a cable and the queen a telegram a-bombs h-bombs even very small ones ripped apart that sand til the stench was just revolting and the sky a greenish tan but the soldier said sir there's a crack in the world and the figures went squash and the bits flew far and wide how the universe sighed chorus x2 when the smoke had blown away there was nothing left to view except a man dear lord who looked like you floating high up in the sky
