the day is my enemy the night my friend for i'm always so alone till the day draws to an end but when the sun goes down and the moon comes through to the monotone of the evening's drone i'm all alone with you all through the night i delight in your love all through the night you're so close to me all through the night from a height far above you and your love brings me ecstasy when dawn comes to waken me you're never there at all i know you've forsaken me till the shadows fall but then once again i can dream i've the right to be close to you all through the night
