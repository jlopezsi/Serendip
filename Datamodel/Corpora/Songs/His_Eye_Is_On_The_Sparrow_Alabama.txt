why should i feel discouraged and why should the shadows come and why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home when jesus is my portion my constant friend is he his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me and i sing because i'm happy i sing because i am free his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me let not your heart be troubled his tender word i hear and resting on his goodness i lose my doubts and fears though by the path he leads us but one step i may see his eye is on the sparrows and i know he watches me and i sing because i'm happy and i sing because i'm free his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me
