o to sleep you weary hobo let the towns drift slowly by can't you hear the steel rail humming that's a hobo's lullaby do not think about tomorrow let tomorrow come and go tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar safe from all the wind and snow i know the police cause you trouble they cause trouble everywhere but when you die and go to heaven you won't find no policemen there i know your clothes are torn and ragged and your hair is turning grey lift your head and smile at trouble you'll find happiness some day so go to sleep you weary hobo let the towns drift slowly by don't you feel the steel rail humming that's a hobo's lullaby
