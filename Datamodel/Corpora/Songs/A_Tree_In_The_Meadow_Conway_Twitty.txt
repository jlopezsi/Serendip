in the country lies a meadow in the meadow stands a tree neath the tree flows a river but my fondest memory is the tree in the meadow with a stream drifting by and carved upon that tree i see i'll love you till i die i will always remember the love in your eyes the day you carved upon that tree i'll love you till i die and farther on down lovers lane a silhouette i see i know you're kissing someone else i wish that it were me by the tree in the meadow my thoughts always lie and wherever you go you'll always know i'll love you till i die
