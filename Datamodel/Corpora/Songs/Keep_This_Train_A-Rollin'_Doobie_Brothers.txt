michael mcdonald sure as that old whistle's blowin there's a tug upon my heart somewhere in that misty mornin light there's another brand new start sometimes i'd love to see this end and watch it fall apart cause it's still such a long road and we're a long way from the start you know anyone can say what's wrong that don't make it right to me we weren't born into this life to walk away from everything once you get the blues in your stride all you need's a song to survive you think by now we would know that we're gonna keep this train a-rollin we ain't gonna break down on this highway we could sit here waitin worried wonderin wishin we were somewhere other than right her but we're right here
