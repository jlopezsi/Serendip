she's got her independence in a hard fast way she's got me chasing shadows with everything i try to say some say she's far too quick some say she's slow to learn but all i know is she gave me love that left afterburn and it's fire feeds me i'm hungry still so baby listen now i'm at your will but i'm not a flower on your windowsill don't want your best friend don't need a godsend don't want your new trends i want you she's got a silver sabre with a diamond shine it's not an ego-trip just her frightened way to keep you blind shadow dancing nowhere fast you got to meet me half way girl if it's gonna last i remember that first night i dream of it still i want that feeling and i want that thrill i've always loved you and i always will take me home
