touched by thoughts as cold as ice like some bathroom floor no love can be worth this price still i ask for more endless days and restless nights and forgotten scenes hopelessly i tried to find escape from this deam baby i miss you when are you coming home no matter where you are i hate being alone love is sweet and bitter too the taste can leave cold you know i hate it but i cannot refuse to capture control how it seems there's no way out i guess i never knew emptiness has left no doubt now i want you baby i miss you when are you coming home no matter where you are i hate being alone baby i miss you when are you coming home no matter where you are i hate being alone baby i miss you when are you coming home you've been gone for so long baby i miss you when are you coming home tell me you're coming back
