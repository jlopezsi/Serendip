there's a time when the heart can no longer give in you try to stand up and fight you've known pain for so long and you know what's gone wrong but you can't make it right another broken heart is all you're feeling how can you go on but the memories of the times there was love in your eyes keep leading me on chorus if it were you would you hold on and hope that it might bring back the dreams we once knew or just give up forever that part of your life tell me what would you do if it were you you can never take back all you've given in love no matter how hard you try once it's over and done you just have to let go though a part of you died another waste of time is all that's left now but life must go on all the nights that we spent never thought they would end why can't they go on chorus if it were you would you hold on and hope that it might bring back the love we once knew or just give up forever that part of your life tell me what would you do if it were you if it were you tell me what would you do if it were you over and over i go back through time didn't we promise our love till we die asking you deep down inside did we really try another broken heart is all that's left but life must go on all the nights that we spent never thought they would end why can't they go on chorus
