spoken you know tonight is a very important night for me for a number of reasons my little girl is here tonight and i don't think you understand what it's like being the daughter of someone who's always gone it's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely and i guess she thinks to herself sometimes is mummy ever going ever gonna come home and so my daughter looked up at me last week and she said mummy when are you just gonna stay home one day and be with me and so it kinda struck me funny and i didn't realize that i hadn't spent anytime with her for a long time so i sat down and wrote down this song after she went to bed and i told her tonight when it was bedtime i would sing her son i bet you ask yourself why i'm never there it's not because i like being away you see i've made a spectacle of myself and it seems that the whole world needs me i understand when you cry alone and mama's not there to wipe your eyes you see it's only because i'm out being someone to make you cry i got a little letter and i read it on the plane and in my heart i felt a funny kind of pain i wish that i could be there to touch your face again mimi you're beautiful mimi you're mine and other things that i do in my life seem to take up all your precious time there's so much i long to say so much more i long to do but i guess it's all just have to wait till i can get to see you mimi you're mine oh mimi you're mine oh mimi you fill my life you fill my life with so much love cause you're beautiful and you love me and you'll understand mimi it's bedtime say goodnight goodnight
