i'm just a wandering gypsy i'll sing for you tonight and when the seats are empty i'll turn and walk into my spotlight and i'll be in the place where i belong for who will tell the story except someone like me of tragedy and glory of lovers as they walk so blindly and try to find a place where they belong we all must find a place where we belong everybody knows me everone shows me and i'll be here when you have gone for the road to carry on we all must find a place where we belong if destiny has spoken if finally the dawn has broken we all must find a place where we belong i'm just a wandering gypsy i've sung for you tonight and now the seats are empty i'll turn and walk into my spotlight and i'll be in the place where i belong
