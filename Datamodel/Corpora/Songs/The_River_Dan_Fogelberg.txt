i was born by a river rolling past a town given no direction just told to keep my head down as i took my position a man fired a gun i was so steeped in tradition that i could not run i was raised by a river weaned upon the sky and in the mirror of the waters i saw myself learn to cry as my tears hit the surface i saw what had been done i gave feet to my freedom and i did run someday later i saw the writing in the dust it told me how i should travel it told me who i was i ran far from the river far as i could see and as the sun hit my shoulders i felt it burning me how i longed for the waters as the fire raged how i longed for the river as i aged i will die by a river as it rolls away bury me in the nighttime do not waste the day high above the waters that roll on to the sea all the angels in heaven will laugh at me they will laugh at me my life was naught but a river rolling through my brain made of so many teardrops made of so much pain
