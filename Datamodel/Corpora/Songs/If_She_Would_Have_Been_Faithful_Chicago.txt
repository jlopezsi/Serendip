i was thinking about her visiting the past reconstructing details with old photographs i was studying the faces with an objective point of view suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me i'll follow the sun and now the time has come and so my love i must go and though i lose a friend in the end you will know oh one day you'll find that i have gone but tomorrow might rain so i'll follow the sun all the time you couldn't tell me that one day i'd be glad that something that i thought was love was misinterpreted but they were doing me a favor a blessing in disguise if she would've been faithful if she could have been true then i would've been cheated i would never know real love i would've missed out on you i watch you sleeping your body touching me there's no doubt about it this is where i want to be you know it's so ironic i had to lose to win i want to thank her if she would've been faithful if she could have been true then i would've been cheated i would never know real love i would've missed out on you it's a paradox full of contradiction how i got from there to here it defies a logical explanation if she would've been faithful if she could have been true then i would've been cheated i would never know real love i would've missed out on you if she would've been faithful if she could have been true then i would've been cheated i would never know real love i would've missed out on you
