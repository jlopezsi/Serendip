where could i go where could i run even if i found the strength to fly and if i rose on the wings of the dawn and crashed through the corner of the sky if i sailed past the edge of the sea even if i made my bed in hell still there you would find me cause nothing is beyond you you stand beyond the reach of our vain imaginations our misguided piety the heavens stretch to hold you and deep cries out to deep singing that nothing is beyond you nothing is beyond you time cannot contain you you fill eternity sin can never stain you death has lost its sting and i cannot explain the way you came to love me except to say that nothing is beyond you nothing is beyond you if i should shrink back from the light so i can sink into the dark if i take cover and i close my eyes even then you would see my heart and you'd cut through all my pain and rage the darkness is not dark to you and night's as bright as day nothing is beyond you you stand beyond the reach of our vain imaginations our misguided piety the heavens stretch to hold you and deep cries out to deep singing that nothing is beyond you nothing is beyond you and time cannot contain you you fill eternity sin can never stain you and death has lost its sting and i cannot explain the way you came to love me except to say that nothing is beyond you nothing is beyond you nothing is beyond you
