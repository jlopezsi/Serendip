sling your hook in with him baby he's a real sharp-shooter now if he's out there hiding in the tall grass tell him i said he was a coward this ain't any old western honey it's the twentieth century now but if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy and he's hurt her then i want to know how did he shoot her with his compromise like a heart attack he can paralyze or did he hang her in a noose on the telephone line did he shoot her with a forty five did he leave his mark right between her eyes oh did he shoot that girl that used to be mine tell him i'm ready any time he chooses the pay-off for the things for the things he's done he ain't messing with no two-bit bandit armed with a couple of guns if he wants to see it as a two reel movie he's living in the head of someone else but better take him down and dust him honey i want to hear the truth for myself did he shoot her did he shoot her
