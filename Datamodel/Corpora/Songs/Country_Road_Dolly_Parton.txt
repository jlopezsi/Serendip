saw you turnin down main street in your big black fancy car you were dressed up fit to kill with a pretty girl on your arm you spun around and you headed up town where the neon lights all shine left me choking in a cloud of dust you never pay me no mind chorus you're livin in the fast lane i guess i'm just too slow i never wore silk or fancy furs just plain ole calico i'll never be a fast lane lover and they're the only kind you take up town i am just a country road that you keep turnin down if you ever hit a dead end street if it's love that you're looking for you can always turn around and beat a path right to my door do i have to draw you a map you seem to know your way around so when you're tired of spinnin your wheels baby we can go to town repeat chorus i'll never be a fast lane lover and they're the only kind you take up town i am just a country road that you keep turnin down i am just a country road that you keep turnin down repeat chorus
