let me love you tonight let me tell you how much i adore all your charms though you leave me tomorrow for this night we'll borrow a love song let me love you tonight let me thrill to the touch of your sheltering arms til the scent of the roses caresses and closes your eyes let me kiss you tonight while the stars in the sky give a heavenly light so when love is an ember my heart will remember this sight live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight then forget me darling only let me love you tonight live a lifetime of love in a moment holding me tight then forget me darling only let me love you tonight let me love you tonight let me love you tonight
