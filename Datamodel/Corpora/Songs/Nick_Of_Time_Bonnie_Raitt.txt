a friend of mine she cries at night and she calls me on the phone sees babies everywhere she goes and she wants one of her own she's waited long enough she says and still she can't decide pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside she's scared scared she'll run out of time i see my folks they're getting old and i watch their bodies change i know they see the same in me and it makes us both feel strange no matter how you tell yourself it's what we all go through those eyes are pretty hard to take when they're staring back at you scared to run out of time chorus when did the choices get so hard with so much more at stake life gets mighty precious when there's less of it to waste hummmm scared to run out of time just when i thought i'd had enough and all my tears were shed no promise left unbroken there were no painful words unsaid you came along and showed me how to leave it all behind you opened up my heart again and then much to my surprise i found love baby love in the nick of time i found love darling love in the nick of time i found love baby love in the nick of time
