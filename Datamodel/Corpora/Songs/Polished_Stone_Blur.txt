now i fall to the ground i can't get up well never mind i know you'll pull me up by my bones and say i'm sand to polished stone today's gone and it won't be long before we fall asleep and forget what we've done we won't get up cause today is fun we're alone now you bite my tongue and when the alcohol's gone i won't feel a thing so you can't carry on today's gone and it won't be long before we fall asleep and forget what we've done we won't get up cause today is fun we're alone it's numb it's numb it's numb
