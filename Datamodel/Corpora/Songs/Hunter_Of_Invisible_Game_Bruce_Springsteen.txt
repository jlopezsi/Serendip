i hauled myself up out of a ditch i built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain honey i'm the hunter of invisible game well i woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack and a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks there were empty cities and burning plains honey i'm the hunter of invisible game we all come up a little short and we go down hard these days i spend my time skipping through the dark through the empires of dust i chant your name honey i'm the hunter of invisible game through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on down into the valley where the beast has his throne i sing my song and i sharpen my blade honey i'm the hunter of invisible game strength is vanity and time is illusion i feel you breathing the rest is confusion your skin touches mine what else to explain honey i'm the hunter of invisible game now pray for yourself and that you may not fall when the hour of deliverance comes on us all when high hope and faith and courage and trust can rise or vanish like dust and dust now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed honey i'm the hunter of the invisible game honey i'm the hunter of the invisible game honey i'm the hunter of the invisible game
