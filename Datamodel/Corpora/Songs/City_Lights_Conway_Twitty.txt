a bright array of city lights as far as i can see the great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me the cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite a broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine they paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright but it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights the world was dark and god made stars to brighten up the night but god who put the stars above i don't believe made those lights for it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights
