away from the city that hurts and knocks i'm standing alone by the desolate docks in the still and the chill of the night i see the horizon the great unknown my heart has an ache it's as heavy as stone with the dawn coming on make it last i cover the waterfront i'm watching the sea will the one i love be coming back to me i cover the waterfront in search of my love an i'm covered by a starlit sky above here am i patiently waiting hoping and longing oh how i yearn where are you have you thought back time will you remember will you return will the one i love be coming back to me
