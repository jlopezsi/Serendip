daybreak i can't hide the truth it seems i'm not so strong and suddenly there's no more to lose so where did i go wrong i should have known before her love for me was gone now i'm waiting for the light to fill this empty room i need you now to break through the night whose shadows came too soon i waited far too long and now i feel i can't go on chorus daybreak oh daybreak i let her walk away i should have said don't go i know i should have found another way now i don't know what to do so daybreak please break through daybreak i feel so alone why won't you come to stay i waited far too long and now i feel i can't go on repeat chorus
