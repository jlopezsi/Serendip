they tell me somewhere this life isn't crazy but i've traveled the world far and wide and i say they're wrong don't sell me stories that music's a lady it's not when the singer's alone at the end of a song chorus at the end of a song there's no one after the last note is played only the memory stays then even that fades away and there's nothing so hard as convincing your heart that you should start singing again you told me nothing could change perfect lovers but like every promise you made it broke before long it's lonely falling away from each other but we've come to the last of your words and the end of a song chorus
