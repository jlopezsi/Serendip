you've given me a true love and ev'ry day i thank you love for a feeling that's so new so inviting so exciting whenever you are near i hear a symphony a tender melody pulling me closer closer to your arms then suddenly oo your lips are touching mine a feeling so divine til i leave the past behind i'm lost in a world made for you and me oo love me whenever you are near i hear a symphony play sweet and tenderly ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby baby baby i feel a joy within don't let this feeling end let it go on and on and on now baby baby baby those tears that fill my eyes i care not for myself but for those who've never felt the joy we've felt whenever you are near i hear a symphony each time you speak to me i hear a tender rhapsody of love love baby baby as you stand up holding me whispering how much you care a thousand violins fill the air now baby baby don't let this moment end keep standing close to me oo so close to me baby baby baby baby i hear a symphony a tender melody ah it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
