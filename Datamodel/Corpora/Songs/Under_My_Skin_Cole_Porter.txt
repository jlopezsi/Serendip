i've got you under my skin i've got you deep in the heart of me so deep in my heart you're really a part of me i've got you under my skin i've tried so not to give in i've said to myself this affair never will go so well so why should i try to resist when darling i know so well i've got you under my skin i'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats repeats in my ear don't you know little fool you never can win use your mentality wake up to reality but each time i do just the thought of you makes me stop before i begin cause i've got you under my skin
