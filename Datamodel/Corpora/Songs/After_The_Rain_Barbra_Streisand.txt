after we love we bathe in a glow remembering what happened a moment ago like after the rain when the wind breezes a sigh while it's resting on pillows of sky deep in your arms it's peaceful and warm together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm in a moment or two we can hear the stars coming through i love the quiet right after the rain here with you after the rain the birds want to fly the trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry like puddles and pools what your eyes let me see are their loving reflections of me after a while you touch me and then i feel like a flower that longs for a shower again and then lost in a kiss i could stay for hours like this though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain i know that everything's wonderful after the rain
