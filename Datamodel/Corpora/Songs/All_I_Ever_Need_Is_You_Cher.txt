sometimes when i'm down and all alone just like a child without a home the love you give me keeps me hanging on oh honey all i ever need is you you're my first love you're my last you're my future you're my past and loving you is all i ask,oh honey all i ever need is you winters come and they go and we watch the melting snow sure as summer follows spring all the things you do give me a reason to build my world around you some men follow rainbows i am told some men search for silver some for gold i have found my treasure in your soul honey all i ever need is you without love i'd never find a way through ups and downs of every single day i won't sleep at night until you say my honey all i ever need is you
