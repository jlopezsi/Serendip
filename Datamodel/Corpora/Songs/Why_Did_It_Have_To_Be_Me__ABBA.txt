when you were lonely you needed a man someone to lean on well i understand it's only natural but why did it have to be me nights can be empty nights can be cold so you were looking for someone to hold that's only natural but why did it have to be me i was so lonesome i was blue i couldn't help it it had to be you and i always thought you knew the reason why i only wanted a little love affair now i can see you are beginning to care but baby believe me it's better to forget me men are toys in the game that you play when you get tired you throw them away that's only natural but why did it have to be me falling in love with a woman like you happens so quickly there's nothing to do it's only natural but why did it have to be me i was so lonesome i was blue i couldn't help it it had to be you and i always thought you knew the reason why i only wanted a little love affair now i can see you are beginning to care but baby believe me it's better to forget me
