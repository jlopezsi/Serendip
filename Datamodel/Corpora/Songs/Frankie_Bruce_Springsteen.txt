dark weekends in the sun out on chelsea road descending the stairs frankie my one check your makeup in the mirror c'mon babe let's go we'll dance round this dirty town til the night is all done let all the finer things sleep alone tonight let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight don't worry about us baby we'll be alright well everybody's dying this town's closing down they're all sittin down at the courthouse waiting for em to take the flag down i see strange flashes in the sky up above gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that i love at dusk the stars all appear on the screen yeah just like they do each night in my dreams but tonight's no dream frankie i can feel myself too well now and forever my love is for you walk softly tonight little stranger yeah into these shadows we're passing through talk softly tonight little angel you make all my dream worlds come true well lately i've been standing out in the freezing rain readin them want ads out on chelsea road i'm winging down the street in search of new games hustling through these nightlights diamond glow well frankie i don't know what i'm gonna find maybe nothing at all maybe a world i can call mine shining like these streetlights down here on the strand bright as the rain in the palm of your hand walk softly tonight little stranger into the shadows where lovers go talk softly to me little angel whisper your secrets so soft and low
