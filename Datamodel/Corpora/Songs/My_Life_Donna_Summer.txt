when i was young i used to dream of going far having my once in a lifetime chance to prove i was a star a thousand times i stood in the wings dreaming it was me i heard the people going wild but it was just my fantasy life is a dance maybe we're all players so stand up and smile and don't be afraid this is my night this is my song standing right here out on the stage is where i belong this is my song this is my night standing right here out on the stage in the spotlight whoo hoo i traveled the road wherever the road would lead i made mistakes but i wouldn't quit i made myself believe dreams come true for those who dream so one day you can say if the music be the fruit of life then let my music play life is a dance maybe we're all players so stand up and smile and don't you be afraid this is my life this is my song standing right here out on the stage is where i belong this is your life this is my song this is my life standing right here out on the stage in the spotlight
