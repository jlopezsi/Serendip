i can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray lyin cold the way you left em but at least your lips caressed them while you packed or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink but at least you thought you wanted it that's so much more than i can say for me what a good year for the roses many blooms still linger there the lawn could stand another mowin funny i don't even care as you turn to walk away as the door behind you closes the only thing i have to say it's been a good year for the roses after three full years of marriage it's the first time that you haven't made the bed i guess the reason we're not talkin there's so little left to say we haven't said while a million thoughts go racin through my mind i find i haven't said a word from the bedroom the familiar sound of a baby's cryin goes unheard what a good year for the roses many blooms still linger there the lawn could stand another mowin funny i don't even care as you turn to walk away as the door behind you closes the only thing i have to say it's been a good year for the roses
