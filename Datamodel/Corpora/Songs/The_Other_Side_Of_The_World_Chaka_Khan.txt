i had known you for quite some time but the thought of love never crossed my mind it seemed to be on the other side of the world too many times had i loved and not cared at all about love just to have something to do then i saw a different you and oh my there's so many stories of love all with the wonders of love and so very sad i would be cause none belonged to me could be it's all for the best so i finally let it rest sad but i felt that maybe love wasn't meant for me so crazy how things can change your life now that love is you everything is right and loneliness is the other side of the world
