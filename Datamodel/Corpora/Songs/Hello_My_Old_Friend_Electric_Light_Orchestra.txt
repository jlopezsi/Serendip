early morning day is dawning cooling towers and factory gates dirty streets and laughing people skinny dogs and beer crates hello my old friend hello my old friend sad canals green black water somewhere bicycles and beds wet and windy afternoons and pigeons coo in garden sheds hello my old friend hello my old friend high-rise tower blocks with panoramic views of trains and coal tiehead railway tracks tread faithfully the gas works to behold hello my old friend hello my old friend just to see the sunset pretty rainbows over your majestic towers to feel your earth beneath my feet here i could stand for hours and hours young girls sing fara jacka in the background big machines that once were champions turn to dust under the sky broken windows choking chimneys factory walls for miles and miles bye bye my old friend bye bye my old friend just to see the sunset pretty rainbows over your majestic towers to feel your earth beneath my feet here i could stand for hours and hours
