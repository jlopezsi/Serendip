i was folding up your letters unpacking winter clothes searching for my hat i thought i left it by the door so i tore around the room like a bird without a head i saw your picture waving back at me from underneath the bed from a long long time ago when all i had was a hat full of stars the one i'll always treasure the one that you wore you loved the look but you never looked inside you would have seen us there you could've seen far you should've seen the magic in my hat full of stars i'm trying to live in the present but i keep tripping on the past finding out reality well clarity comes in dribs and drabs no we never had the time for everything we had so it felt like we had nothing that's what makes this hat so sad it was a long long time ago when all we had was a hat full of stars you would have seen us there you could've seen far you should've seen the magic in my hat full of stars now whenever i'm alone and i think i might forget i wear my lucky hat just like a crown up on my head cause all i have is a hat full of stars if you could see me now you would've seen far you should've seen the magic in my hat full of stars
