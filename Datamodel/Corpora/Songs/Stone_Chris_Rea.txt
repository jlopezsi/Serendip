tangled dream and endless highways bang the drum in a foreign land sometimes i wonder what i'm chasing when all i need is the touch of your hand i've got no fixed abode out of own babe it gets so cold without your love i'm just a stone and we all laugh and the jokes get wilder staying up staying out drinking till you fade away in to the morning and the strangest cold eats deeper still without you sweet kiss i'm gone forever without your touch i've no control without your love i'm just a looser without your love i'm just a stone
