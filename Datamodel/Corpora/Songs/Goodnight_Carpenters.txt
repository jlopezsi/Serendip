when i was young i'd listen to the radio waitin for my favorite songs when they played i'd sing along it made me smile those were such happy times and not so long ago how i wondered where they'd gone but they're back again just like a long lost friend all the songs i loved so well every sha-la-la-la every wo-o-wo-o still shines every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin to sing's so fine when they get to the part where he's breakin her heart it can really make me cry just like before it's yesterday once more lookin back on how it was in years gone by and the good times that i had makes today seem rather sad so much has changed it was songs of love that i would sing to then and i'd memorize each word those old melodies still sound so good to me as they melt the years away every sha-la-la-la every wo-o-wo-o still shines every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin to sing's so fine all my best memories come back clearly to me some can even make me cry just like before it's yesterday once more every sha-la-la-la every wo-o-wo-o still shines every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin to sing's so fine every sha-la-la-la every wo-o-wo-o still shines every shing-a-ling-a-ling
