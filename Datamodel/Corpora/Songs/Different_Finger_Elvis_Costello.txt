please put your rings on a diffrent finger if you meet me tonight cause i can't stand those suspicious glances cause i know the things they're saying are right they're saying why don't you straighten up and see what youve got to lose put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose i don't want to hear your whole life story or about my strange resemblance to some old flame all i want is one night of glory i don't even know your second name please put your rings on a diffrent finger cause weve got so much at stake i can't stand those suspicious glances cause they seem to cover evry move i make but if i can be alone with you completely tonight put your rings on a diffrent finger before i turn out the light
