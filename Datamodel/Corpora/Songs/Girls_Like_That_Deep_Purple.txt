i'm in a bad spot babe i can't hear what you say i'd love to stop and talk you keep fading away just the way she said it something in her tone always so convincing but she's good on the phone i'll wait until she's ready that could be a while she always takes her time then she turns up in style something not right didn't recognize the car women being what they are there is no sense of reason in a reasonable world makes any sense at all to a reasonable girl she said you know what i mean but i couldn't understand didn't know what she said i'm a reasonable man it wasn't meant that way i was only having fun she looked me in the eye but the damage was done i got the vague impression she was under my thumb i looked the other way and i had to succumb girls like that i want girls like that girls like that i like girls like that
