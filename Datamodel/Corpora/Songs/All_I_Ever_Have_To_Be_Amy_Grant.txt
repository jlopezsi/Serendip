when the weight of all my dreams is resting heavy on my head and the thoughtful words of help and hope have all been nicely said but i'm still hurting wondering if i'll ever be the one i think i am i think i am then you gently re-remind me that you've made me from the first and the more i try to be the best the more i get the worst and i realize the good in me is only there because of who you are who you are and all i ever have to be is what you've made me any more or less would be a step out of your plan as you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind that i only have to do what i can find and all i ever have to be all i have to be all i ever have to be is what you've made me
