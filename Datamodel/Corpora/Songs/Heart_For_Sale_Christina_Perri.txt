i've got a heart for sale it's a little worn and torn and pale if it beats then i'll make you a deal i'll give it to you for free if you can love it carefully and get it away from me chorus i know that i should keep it for a while and learn what it may need to survive but i can't no i won't make it through one more loveless bruise i can't seem to get it right but i try and try and try in the end i just lose all the fights and crawl back home to hope my heart can make it through another night of the same oh pain chorus i know that i should keep it for a while and learn what it may need to survive but i can't no i won't make it through one more loveless bruise bridge i'll give you a try if your not satisfied then send it back and i'll mend the cracks and i'll look for another buyer chorus i know that i should keep it for a while and learn what it needs to survive but i can't no i won't make it through one more loveless bruise tired of being used you don't know what i've been through
