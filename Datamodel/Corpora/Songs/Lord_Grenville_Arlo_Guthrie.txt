go and tell lord grenville that the tide is on the turn it's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern we'll be gone before the dawn returns like voices onthe wind go and tell lord grenville that our dreams have run aground there's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town none of us are caring where we're bound like voices on the wind and come the day you'll hear them saying they're throwing it all away nothing more to say just throwing it all away go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out we're on our way to nowhere now can't bring the helm about none of us are left in any doubt we won't be back again send a message to the fleet they'll search for us in vain we won't be there among the reaches of the spanish main tell the ones we left home not to wait we won't be back again and come the day you'll hear them saying they're throwing it all away nothing more to say just throwing it all away our time is just a point along a line that runs forever with no end i never thought that we would come to find ourselves upon these rocks again go and tell lord grenville that the tide is on the turn
