there's no method in my madness no craft no guile no expertise no self assuring smile no wizardry or witchcraft no crass deceit no dark conspiracies i stand on my own two feet i'm coming through just like jack ruby i ragged around the edges but i got control there's no way around it and i got control i reach out for my program still got control straight down to business who needs control i've got panache just like jack ruby i don't beg forgiveness i don't beg at all but i beg to differ cause i got the ball there was no invitation you're not my type and what's gone it ain't worth having kiss it all goodbye right on the money just like jack ruby
