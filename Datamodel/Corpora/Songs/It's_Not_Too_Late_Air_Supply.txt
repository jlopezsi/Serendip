i stand alone i'm just a face in the crowd i get lonely if the truth be said sometimes i want to cry out loud but i try to understand instead i wish i had the strength inside to walk right up to you i'd never have to hide behind these doubts i know are true it's not too late to fall in love accept your fate i'm the one you're thinking of it's not too late so don't run away i need you too but it's hard for me so hard for me to say so i listen for the perfect moment to rush to you but my heart's too slow everybody here can see me stumble better wait until the lights get low wish i had the strength inside to walk right up to you i wouldn't have to hide behind these doubts i know are true it's not too late to fall in love accept your fate i'm the one your thinking of it's not too late so don't run away i need you too but it's hard for me yes it's hard for me yes it's hard for me so hard for me to say it's not too late to fall in love accept your fate i'm the one you're thinking of it's not too late so don't run away i need you too but it's hard for me so hard for me to say
