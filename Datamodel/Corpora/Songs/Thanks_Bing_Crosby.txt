we used to dwell in love's own palace a palace of dreams come true now that we're through i bear no malice though we've called it a day all i can say is thanks for all the lovely delights i found in your embrace i'm thankful though i know it's ending all too soon and thanks for unforgettable nights i never can replace and memories that linger like a haunting tune it is better to have loved you dear and lost than never to have loved at all yes it's better for no matter what the cost i held the world in sway an emperor for a day and thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise we lost our road but still i must convey our thanks it is better to have loved you dear and lost than never to have loved at all yes its better for no matter what the cost i held the world in sway an emperor for a day and thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise we lost our way but still i must convey my thanks
