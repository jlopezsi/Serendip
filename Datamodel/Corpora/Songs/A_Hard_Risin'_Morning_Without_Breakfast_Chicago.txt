today when i awoke the morning blues hung over me so i looked it straight in the eye i jumped into the shower for bout an hour aw it was fine yeah it helps me all the time it's soothin to my mind just to see those blues go slippin down the drain now i usually have my breakfast which consists of tasty spam yeah i could eat it all day long but i only love one brand and i can't find it way out here so i have to take a pass and settle for some hash when i drive and you're not here oh sweet sweet spam
