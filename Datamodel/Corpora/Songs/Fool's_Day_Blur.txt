wake up straight caught out by the sun on the first day of april out of bed thought there was a plane crash but i'm sure that i was dreaming tv on of course caffeine a science of submission again another day on this little island just a bell hangs on porridge done i take my kid to school past the pound shop woolworth's under bridge where the subway the daytime and the westway flies by then on my bike down the ladbroke grove to the forthcoming dramas a studio and a love of all sweet music we just can't let go let go let go let go let go so meditate on what we've all become on a cold day in springtime civil war is what were all born into raise your left hand right sing don't capitulate to the forces of the marketplace they've long departed consolidate the love we have together on a cold day in springtime
