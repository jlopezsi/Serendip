thinking out of line just to make the sun shine anyway i can be like you fighting with the truth trying to hide a fool in a fantasy i'm dreaming lay me down and take me now our lady of the skies hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality aiming high at my dream but i can get along she makes me strong anyway i'm dreaming and there is no other way our lady of the skies flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity i can hear your song offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity i'm dreaming let me go our lady of the skies
