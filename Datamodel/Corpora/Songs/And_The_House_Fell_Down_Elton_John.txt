the sun is up and the shades are all pulled down i'm more paranoid with every little sound like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around and a siren wailing on the other side of town oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head if i could think straight i'd wish that i was dead or curled up naked in my lover's bed instead i'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread chorus and i don't recall who said it at this time that your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind i built it up and the wolf he came around he huffed and puffed and the house fell down with a rolled up note i'm hovering on that line three days on a diet of cocaine and wine and a little weed just to level me sometime i put the clock in the drawer cause i've cancelled out the time chorus so don't knock on my door don't try to call i'm holed up in this room talking to the wall when you're high as this you think you know it all when you're this deep in there's no place else to fall chorus and still that saying gets inside my mind that your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind i built it up and the wolf he came around he huffed and puffed and the house fell down
