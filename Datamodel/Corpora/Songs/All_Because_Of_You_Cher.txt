sometimes a heart has a mind of it's own sometimes i can tell myself that i'm better off being alone sometimes but this time i can't hide from the thought of it it's around every corner i turn right there in lights in black and white staring at me chorus it's all because of you that i feel this way all because of you that my heart wants to break if every other love can be forgotten it's all because of you all because of you tonight i can't feel any magic inside tonight cause i can't reach out for the stars lookin up at the moon on my own no signs of life no nothing's right since you've been gone chorus all because of you i can't sleep at night oh no i can't sleep at night and there ain't no rest living second best without your love you don't know what it's like to feel this way all because of you that my heart wants to break if every other love can be forgotten it's all because of you
