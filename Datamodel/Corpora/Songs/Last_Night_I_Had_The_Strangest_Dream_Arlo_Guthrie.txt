words and music by ed mccurdy last night i had the strangest dream i'd ever dreamed before i dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war i dreamed i saw a mighty room filled with women and men and the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again and when the paper was all signed and a million copies made they all joined hands and bowed their heads and grateful pray'rs were prayed and the people in the streets below were dancing round and round while swords and guns and uniforms were scattered on the ground last night i had the strangest dream i'd never dreamed before i dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war
