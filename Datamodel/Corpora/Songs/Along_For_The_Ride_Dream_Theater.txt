at this moment words fail me and my vision's unclear blind to the truth like hands reaching out in the darkness chorus i can't stop the world from turning around or the pull of the moon on the tide but i don't believe that we're in this alone i believe we're along for the ride i believe we're along for the ride through the gift of surrender i'm embracing the fight breaking the code there's clarity on the horizon chorus i can't stop the world from turning around or the pull of the moon on the tide but i don't believe that we're in this alone i believe we're along for the ride i believe we're along for the ride i will not live under a shadow of fear never be crippled by chaos and doubt fall prey to your madness i am not shattered out of the ashes i rise knowing that nothing is stronger than faith finding hope in our hopeless lives chorus i can't stop the world from turning around or the pull of the moon on the tide but i don't believe that we're in this alone i believe we're along for the ride i can't stop the world from turning around or the pull of the moon on the tide but i don't believe that we're in this alone i believe we're along for the ride i believe we're along for the ride i believe we're along for the ride
