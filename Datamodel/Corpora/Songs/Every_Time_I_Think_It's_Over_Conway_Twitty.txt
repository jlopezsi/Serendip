when we run into problems it's always hard for me to compromise i get to thinkin bout my freedom and all the ways that i could start another life and i wonder if our forever could be coming to an end so everytime i think it's over i think it over again too many hearts get broken i know that happens all the time but when you split love down the middle tell me where do you draw the line anyway you look at it does anybody win so everytime i think it's over i think it over again i've finally come to realize that ups and downs are all a part of love and there's just no better feelin when the angers dies and we start making up and from that new beginning we come back to being friends and everytime i think it's over i think it over again too many hearts get broken i know that happens all the time but when you split love down the middle tell me where do you draw the line anyway you look at it does anybody win so everytime i think it's over i think it over again and everytime i think it's over i think it over again
