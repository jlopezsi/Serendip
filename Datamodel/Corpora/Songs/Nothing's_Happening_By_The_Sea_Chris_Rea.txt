salty river falls asleep in the bay always gets there never early never late nothing's happening nothing's happening by the sea white waves tumble down and gently roll back into blue on wooden seats outside the bar the couples make their rendezvous nothing's happening nothing's happening by the sea the trouble has been found there's too far ups and too many downs i found a level that feels just right there's no mistaking where i'm going tonight nothing's happening nothing's happening by the sea
