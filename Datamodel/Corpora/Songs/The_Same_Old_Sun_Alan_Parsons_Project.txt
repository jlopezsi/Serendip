tell me what to do now the light in my life is gone from me is it always the same is the night never ending tell me what to do all the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me there's a smile on my face but i'm only pretending taking my life one day at a time cause i can't think what else to do taking some time to make up my mind when there's no one to ask but you the same old sun would shine in the morning the same bright eyes would welcome me home and the moon would rise way over my head and get through the night alone and the same old sun will shine in the morning the same bright stars will welcome me home and the clouds will rise way over my head i'll get through the night on my own tell me what to do now there's nobody watching over me if i seem to be calm well it's all an illusion tell me what to do when the fear of the night comes over me there's a smile on my face just to hide the confusion taking my life one day at a time cause i can't think what else to do taking some time to make up my mind when there's no one to ask but you the same old sun would shine in the morning the same bright eyes would welcome me home and the moon would rise way over my head and get through the night alone and the same old sun will shine in the morning the same bright stars will welcome me home and the clouds will rise way over my head i'll get through the night on my own
