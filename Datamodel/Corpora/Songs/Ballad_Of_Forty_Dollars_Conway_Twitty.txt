the man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die he laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes they hired me and fred and joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs it took us seven hours and i guess we must have drunk a case of beer i guess i oughta go and watch em put him down but i don't own the suit and anyway when they start talkin bout the fire and hell well i get spooked so i'll just sit here in my truck and act like i don't know him when they pass and anyway when they're all through i've got to go to work and mow the grass well here they come and who's that ridin in that big ole shiny limousine hm look at all that chrome i do believe that that's the sharpest thing i've seen that must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm when they get parked i'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that that sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black he's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale they say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps i think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like that well here i am and there they go and i guess you'd call it my bad luck i hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks
