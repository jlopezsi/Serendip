the streets were cold and barren the nights were dark and dank and the sky hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years the buildings were dead and the alleys stunk from things that used to live there ahhh that wasn't the city i remembered a child in the street barefoot pullin at his mama's tattered coattails like a rat dogs existence with not a scrap left on the plate and so much like a fable their lives so unstable cause the only thing left was their faith and there sure as hell ain't much i can do about it there's a meltdown in the sky there's a new day comin and i don't know why there's a fear that gets me high and the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by so sad was the scene that my eyes did behold made me wonder just who was the foe and was it all to come true what nostradamus had predicted such a long long time ago you could hear screams and moanin from the people atoning for their sins of a guilt ridden life and the final door shuts from the wind that leaves cuts from the edge on the blade of god's knife and there sure as hell ain't much i can do about there's a melt down in the sky there's a new day comin and i don't know why there's a tear stuck in my eye there's a new day comin and i don't know why battle lines had been drawn mother nature how she cried by her side till the dawn couldn't kill her if they tried how they tried open eyed genocide then she died battle lines had been drawn mother nature how she cried by her side till the dawn couldn't kill her if they tried how they tried open eyed genocide then she died there's a meltdown in the sky there's a new day comin and i don't know why there's a fear that gets me high and the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by
