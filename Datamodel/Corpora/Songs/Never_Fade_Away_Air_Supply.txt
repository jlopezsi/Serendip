walking along the boulevard speaking into the air where can i find the life i know that only dreams can share i close my eyes and see you there calling me far beyond wrapped in a robe of mystery you wave your magic wand maybe it's real only life is illusion don't break my heart hold out your hand and i'll never lose you don't break my heart yes i'm a man and just flesh and bone but you do not love all my dreams are your home i stare through a veil so thin yet so near and walk in your footsteps as you cast off my fear walk with me through the gates of time to eternity and our love will never fade away we can fly to a bridge across the sky where the souls that would always cry will never fade away walking along the boulevard wishing we were complete why are some things so very hard to witness and believe the victor of this universe the victim of the wind where does a dream begin and end and where does life begin maybe it's real only life is illusion don't break my heart hold out your hand and i'll never lose you don't break my heart yes i'm a man and just flesh and bone but you do not love all my dreams are your home i stare through a veil so thin yet so near and walk in your footsteps as you cast off my fear walk with me through the gates of time to eternity and our love will never fade away we can climb to a bridge across the sky where the souls that would always cry will never fade away we can climb to a bridge across the sky where the souls that would always cry will never fade away
