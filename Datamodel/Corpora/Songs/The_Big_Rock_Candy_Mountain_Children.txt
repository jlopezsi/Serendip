in the big rock candy mountains there's a land that's fair and bright where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out ev'ry night where the boxcars are all empty and the sun shines ev'ry day oh i'm bound to go where there ain't no snow where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow in the big rock candy mountains oh the buzzin of the bees in the peppermint trees round the soda water fountains where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings in the big rock candy mountains in the big rock candy mountains you never change your socks and little streams of lemonade come a-tricklin down the rocks the hobos there are friendly and their fires all burn bright there's a lake of stew and soda too you can paddle all around em in a big canoe in the big rock candy mountains oh the buzzin of the bees in the peppermint trees round the soda water fountains where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings in the big rock candy mountains
