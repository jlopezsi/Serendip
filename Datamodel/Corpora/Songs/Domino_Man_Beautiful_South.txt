through ugly pints and sunday breath sit men whose stare is cold as death through wide lapels and glued up eyes through made up kids and made up wives sitting in the heart of them is a man who's not like other men don't you know just who i am a nod a wink i am the domino man and if you pull a double one i'll pack my bags and i'll be gone if you pull a three and four i'm flying off to singapore where women dance and tigers roar i'm lying on a distant shore i'm living life just as as i can a nod a wink another drink i am the domino man through a twenty deep screen of humorists through slavering jaws and angry fists through tales of mishap and the clickety-clack is fully paid member of the brother of the tap through heavy smoke and idle bets through heaving lungs and heavy debts sits a man who knows he can a nod a wink i am the domino man and if you pull a two and a six i'll pack my bags and take that risk and if you pull a four and five they'll never take this man alive i'll go far east and i'll survive the market streets i'll duck and dive i'm living life as fast as i can a nod a wink another drink i am the domino man and when he's off to sail the seven seas he just stay indoors or hides up trees he's been to places that you've never seen but his mind is blank and his passport's clean but if you pull a two and a six i'll pack my bags and take that risk and if you pull a four and five they'll never take this man alive i'll go far east and i'll survive the market street i'll duck and dive i'm living life just as fast as i can a nod a wink another drink i am the domino man
