easy come and easy go hard to get a hold on searching for what you don't know blind to where you belong feel the power in your dreams vision in your sight nothing's dark as it may seem we can make it right chorus i have faith in your love i have faith in your heart you don't need to hide from what you want you've just got to give it all you got the first thing that you need you got to have faith truth hidden between the lies we both know the chances nothing comes from compromise only strength advances i will be here at your side for everything you do when the world tears at your pride i'll be there for you chorus when the world's coming at you like a hungry alligator you got to have faith when you've got to pay them now or they'll take it from you later you got to have faith when you feel like the future's hiding on a distant cloud you got to have faith and you feel like shouting at the good lord out loud you got to have faith chorus when you know that you're ready but the time is not right you got to have faith and you lie awake staring at the ceiling all night you got to have faith
