i can't answer the questions you ask me i don't know what to say the answers are somewhere lost in the stars when the night has turned to day but i know if the silence of night could be here it would drift through my soul and calm all my fear and i could reach out and draw you so near to me touch me and warm me and i will lie still and all that you ask me to give you i will one living moment we'll have for our own a brief flash of time that we spent all alone but you ask me for nothing and give what you can and we're wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again and my memory drifts through the universe when we are one closely we're falling through time and the earth will turn in the silence of space always in motion yet always in place and all things will change yet remain what they are and far will be near and near will be far and the ages will darken and blend into time and all that is poetry will no longer rhyme but our moment together is forever sublime for the time has arrived when we must understand that we're lost in a void on this sad speck of sand and nobody knows where we are no one cares and the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares and the madmen who plunder this world for their fame have forgotten that no one remembers their name but time and the universe are always the same closely we're falling through time
