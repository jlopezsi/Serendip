tell me is it really true there's something goin on outside i just can feel it i heard it on the radio i'm not allowed to go outside i can't believe it there's a big hole in the sky where the radiation's breaking through and we just sit and stare like the rabbit at the snake there's so much we could do but we gotta do it now cause it's gettin pretty late better hurry now we all need the sun we need love and light for everyone we need our atmosphere to live in here we could be so strong we overthrow the government and stop what's goin wrong we're fighting for the sun it's really hard to understand the change of sister sun as if your sunny smile would turn into a deadly one it's not a quality of life to live inside a mighty trap to have that ice-cold coke beyond the radiation gap there should be more resistance against industrial trusts and if there's no solution there should be revolution i wonder if we start in time we're racing with the seconds i wonder if we've got enough to talk to stupid politicians we all need the sun hold on to revolution members of the earth lets fighting for the sun
