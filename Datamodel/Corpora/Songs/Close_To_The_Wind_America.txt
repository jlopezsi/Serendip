ah lately it hasn't been easy i've been wanderin all night searchin tryin to find an answer why i'm in this situation i've been sailing close to the wind trying to keep my head above water close to the wind without you i've been sailing close to the wind everyday it just gets harder but you're all i need to survive for so long it felt like i was walking on the water i found the hard part is waking without you in the morning i've been sailing close to the wind the weight of the world's on my shoulders everyday now close to the wind without you i've been sailing close to the wind the loneliness it's neverending yes i'm falling open your heart come aboard and if we're back together i know our love will be everlasting i still believe that there's a chance for us to have a happy ending peace will reign on earth life for all it's worth oh yeah i pray every single morning that this time we will be much stronger i've been sailing close to the wind help me try to find a shelter to protect you close to the wind without you i've been sailing close to the wind but inside it's safe and warm now we're together don't be afraid of the storm i've been sailing close close to the wind been sailing in close to the wind don't be afraid of the storm i've been sailing close close to the wind been sailing in close to the wind don't be afraid of the storm
