some need gold and some need diamond rings or a drug to take away the pain that living brings a promise of a better world to come when whatever here is done i don't need that sky of blue all i know's since i found you i'm happy when i'm in your arms happy darling come the dark happy when i taste your kiss i'm happy in a love like this there's a house upon a distant hill where you can hear the laughter of children ring guardian angels they watch from above watching over the love that they bring but at night i feel the darkness near i awake and i find you near i'm happy with you in my arms i'm happy with you in my heart happy when i taste your kiss i'm happy in love like this in a world of doubt and fear i wake at night and reach to find you near lost in a dream you caught me as i fell i want more than just a dream to tell we're born in this world darling with few days and trouble never far behind man and woman circle each other in a cage a cage that's been handed down the line lost and running neath a million dead stars tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars happy in each other's arms happy baby come the dark happy in each other's kiss i'm happy in a love like this
