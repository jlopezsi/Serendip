one day away from you i'm feeling something new the way you look at me says everything it's much too late to hide what's building up inside hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul chorus love is the strongest emotion no one can stop what we do love is the strongest emotion that you'll ever feel when your love is real i've been awake all night my eyes are open wide i never dreamed you you're no fantasy oh don't make me wait too long cause you're the only one girl you change my wishes to reality chorus and i want to touch and i want to feel what you do to me cause nothing on earth can move me like you come on baby show me cause i need to give my love to you i want to touch and i want to feel what you do to me cause nothing on earth can move me like you come on baby show me cause i need to give my love love is the strongest emotion no one can stop what we do love is the strongest emotion that you'll ever feel when you know your love is real
