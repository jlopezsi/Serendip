i still can remember the last time i cried i was holding you and loving you knowing it would end i never felt so good yet felt so bad you're the one i love and what makes it sad is you don't belong to me and i can remember the last time i lied i was holding you and telling you we could still be friends tried to let you go but i can't you know and even though i'm not with you i need you so but you don't belong to me chorus comin in and out of your life isn't easy when there are so many nights i can't hold you and i've told you these feelings are so hard to find comin in and out of your life will never free me cause i don't need to touch you to feel you it's so real with you i just can't get you out of my mind but i can remember the last time we tried each needing more than we could give and knowing all the time a stronger love just can't be found even though at times this crazy world is turning up-side-down you'll always belong to me chorus
