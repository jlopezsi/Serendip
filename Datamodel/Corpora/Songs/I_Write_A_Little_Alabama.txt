i lay out some paper i take out my pen turn on my table lamp and here i go again it's time to write a letter i'm in the mood tonight gotta find a way to tell you how i feel inside so i write a little and i cry a little it's so hard to find a way to say goodbye a little but somewhere in the middle my emotions interfere so i write it a little and cry a little tear and i've died a little wishing you were here god i miss you can't be with you i would kiss you oh so good cause you're my only cure for lonely i'd call if i could well i've died a little wishing you were here wishing you were here well i'm writing a little and wishing you were here and i write a little and i cry a little tear and i'm writing and wishing you were here
