i do believe in fate cause that's how we met it was raining and we were soaking wet you took the last of cabs on an empty street then you smiled at me and said take a seat i said do you believe in love at first sight you said if you give me a reason i might ok well your hair is wet and your clothes are a mess and your makeup is all over your face and still you're so chorus beautiful so sweet and just adorable you are a miracle simply irresistible you are so beautiful so sweet and just adorable you are the finest thing that i've seen in my life you're everything that i've ever dreamed of now it's been seven years 1 month and a day since we met and i'm so happy to say today we'll be man and wife and dedicate our lives to the precious thing we have called love so now i'm standing here well dressed and prepared in a black suit that you told me to wear and when you're walking in you amazing thing you take my breath away cause you are so chorus for richer and poorer till death do us part in sickness in health you are always in my heart till the day when we're old and grey i will cherish and love you in every kind of way cause you are so chorus
