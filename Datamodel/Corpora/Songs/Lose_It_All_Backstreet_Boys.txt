oh no take what you need cause i can't hold my breath say what you feel cause i got nothing left oh i made a promise to myself last night i'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right chorus and if i lose it all there'll be nothing left to lose and i would take the fall cause knowing you are out there breathing it's so wonderful it's a chance i take even if i break it i lose it all if i lose it all wouldn't matter anyway don't change a thing perfect as you are time has a way time is all i've got if my heart should shatter watching you that'd be one less thing i'd have to prove chorus and we will be waiting when i fall into your open arms i believe you'll find me there you'll find me there chorus x2 wouldn't matter anyway
