this old house is falling down around my ears i'm drowning in a river of my tears when all my will is gone you hold me sway i need you at the dimming of the day you pull me like the moon pulls on the tide you know just where i keep my better side what days have come to keep us far apart a broken promise or a broken heart now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away i need you at the dimming of the day come the night you're only what i want come the night you could be my confidant come the night you're only what i want come the night you could be my confidant i see you on the street in company why don't you come and ease your mind with me i'm living for the night we steal away i need you at the dimming of the day i need you at the dimming of the day
