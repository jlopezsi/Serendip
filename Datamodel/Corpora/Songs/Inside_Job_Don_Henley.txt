while you were sleeping they came and took it all away the lanes and the meadows the places where you used to play it was an inside job by the well-connected your little protest summarily rejected it was an inside job like it always is chalk it up to business as usual while we are dreaming this little island disappears while you are looking the other way they'll take your right to own your own ideas and it's an inside job favors collected your trusted servants have left you unprotected it was an inside job like it always is just chalk it up to business as usual you think that you're so smart but you don't have a fucking clue what those men up in the towers are doing to me and you and they'll keep doin it and doin it and doin it and doin it and doin it and doin it and doin it and doin it until we all wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up i know what i've done wrong i am acquainted with the night i know how hard it is to always walk out in the light and it's an inside job to learn about forgiving it's an inside job to hang on to the joy of living they know the road by which you came they know your mother's maiden name and what you had for breakfast and what you've hidden in the mattress insect politics indifferent universe bang your head against the wall but apathy is worse it's an inside job it's an inside job it's an inside job yeh yeah it's an inside job it's an inside job it's an inside job it's an inside job it's an inside job it's an inside job
