put your money down take your choice that's the way it is every time with these boys and you sense no shame and you feel no disgrace somebody wins somebody loses it's a dirty dirty race oh my life it's a dog's life one empty monday out of the blue took a good luck turn started something new out of the gutter out of the rain out of my head and i'm feeling no pain oh my life feeling no pain take the strain it's a dog's life ducking in the shadows diving in the dark rolling with the punches striking at the heart touching all the senses breaking those taboos bursting at the seams blowing all my fuses the turning of a page the burning of a book if you're talking out of turn it's just the way you look when the time is right but the shape is wrong and you find yourself where you don't belong back to reality back on the line back into this and you'll feel no pain you wanna do it one more time we can do it once again oh my life it's a dog's life
