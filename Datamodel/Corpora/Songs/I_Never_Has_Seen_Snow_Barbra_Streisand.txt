i done lost my ugly spare i am cheerful now got the warmth all over to smoother my worried brow oh the girl i use to be she ain't me no more i closed the door on the girl i was before hmm feelin fine and full of bliss what i really wanna say is this i never has seen snow all the same i know snow ain't so beautiful can't be so beautiful like my love is like my love is nothin do compare nothin anywhere with my love a hundred things i see a twilight sky that tree but none so beautiful not one so beautiful like my love is like my love is once you see his face none can take the place of my love a stone rolled of my heart when i laid my eyes on that near to me boy with that far away look and right from the start i saw a new horizon and a road to take me where i wanted to be took needed to be took needed to be took oh oh i never have seen snow all the same i know nothin will ever be nothin can ever be beautiful as my love is like my love is to me nothin is as beautiful to me
