don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart the love blooms at night in the daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes oh keep your heart for me for someday i'll return and you know you're the only one i'll ever love too many nights too many stars too many moons to change your mind if i'm gone too long don't forget where you belong when the stars come out remember you are mine don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart the love blooms at night in the daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes oh keep your heart for me for someday i'll return and you know you're the only one i'll ever love too many miles too many days too many nights to be alone ah please keep your heart while we are apart don't you linger in the moonlight when i'm gone don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart the love blooms at night in the daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes oh keep your heart for me for someday i'll return and you know you're the only one i'll ever love you're the only one i'll ever love
