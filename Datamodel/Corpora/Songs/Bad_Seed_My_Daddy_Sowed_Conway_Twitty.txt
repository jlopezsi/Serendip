i was found in wilson county just a mile outside of town on the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where i am i was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows and as far as they concern i'm just a bad seed daddy sowed they brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know and since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow but they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads and they asked the lord to light my path and guide each step i made but the path you're walking on becomes a mighty rocky road when you know that all you'll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed at thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age and with love so strong i could see no wrong in decision that i made and you know i learned that there was truth in all i always been told because you can't judge a book by its cover and everything that's shinin sure isn't gold yes i guess i'm guilty of dreaming an impossible dream because the way the things turned out sure isn't way it seemed and so tonight i'm leavin behind the only thing i ever had to call my own and i know as long as you live you're always be a reminder of all my wrongs but i hope that he'll forgive me when he's old enough to know that just like me he'll always be the bad seed his daddy sowed
