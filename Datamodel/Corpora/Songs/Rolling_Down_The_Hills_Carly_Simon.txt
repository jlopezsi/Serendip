people who have bad times write hard luck songs but when their days are green they think about love sunshine flowers in a garden did i bump you sir i'm beggin your pardon have you seen such a day let's begin it by startin and rollin down the hills with me people who have short hair write short hair songs but when their hair gets long they think about winding it around in daisy chains waitin for the showers just to wash it in the rain have you seen such hair well let the wind play as you're rollin down the hills with me people who have no hills write songs about plains but if that's not what you want to do well you can jump aboard a bus or boat or wooden canoe i know just the mountain that's been waitin for you too write songs about the peaks and the beautiful views as you're rollin down the hills with me
