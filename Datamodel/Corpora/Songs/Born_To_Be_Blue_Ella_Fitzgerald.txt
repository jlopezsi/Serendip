some folks were meant to live in clover but they are such a chosen few and clover being green is something i've never seen cause i was born to be blue when there's a yellow moon above me they say there's moonbeams i should view but moonbeams being gold are something i can't behold cause i was born to be blue when i met you the world was bright and sunny when you left the curtain fell i'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny now my world's a faded pastel well i guess i'm luckier than some folks i've known the thrill of loving you and that alone is more than i was created for cause i was born to be blue
