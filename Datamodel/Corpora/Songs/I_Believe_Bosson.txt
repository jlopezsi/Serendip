you say of love there's no such thing you've only known the pain it brings you question why i give your heart you stay alone you stay apart i've seen i know i trust i feel love is alive and for real and i believe i believe in love i believe two hearts can learn to beat as one and i believe i believe that time can tie your soul to mine i see the doubt there in your eyes but i believe in love i know you're scared i understand please take my word and take my hand if there's no faith inside of you i can believe enough for two i've seen i know i feel i trust love has a future for us i believe i believe in love two hearts can beat as one i believe i believe that time can tie your soul to mine
