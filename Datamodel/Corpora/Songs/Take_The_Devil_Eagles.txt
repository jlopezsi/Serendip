open up your eyes take the devil from your mind he's been holding on to you and you're so hard to find the wind outside is cold restless feeling in my soul tempting me to get away but there's no place a man can go god will you lead me where i roam help me not to let my feelings show no no you are the one oh how could you be so blind the devil prays on runaways he's never far behind the many years i've tried now have been revealed to me closer is the love you'll find waiting so patiently god will you lead me where i roam help me not to let my feelings show no no take the devil take the devil from your mind
