when the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls and the stars begin to flicker in the sky through the mist of a memory you wander back to me breathing my name with a sigh in the still of the night once again i'll hold you tight though you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams and as long as my heart will beat love we'll always meet here in my deep purple dreams and as long as my heart will beat love we'll always meet here in my deep purple dreams
