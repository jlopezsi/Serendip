careless talk that's what you heard about me jealous talk that's what i heard about you everybody's telling lies i don't even know why why can't people find something better to do careless talk i don't believe what they say i heard them talk they say you've been putting me down in the shadows on the phone they won't leave us alone they've been talking ever since you came around careless talk telling you i'm doing wrong jealous talk follows wherever you go i'm aware of what you heard every terrible word everybody's making believe that they know all of the intimate things that we ever might have said in the heat of a passionate moment in a conversation shared for the ears of nobody else there are some things they will never hear there are secrets i'll never tell careless talk going around on the streets jealous talk i know how bad it can be let them stand where they fall they don't know us at all all that talking won't make a difference to me
