somewhere up above the stars the wreckage of a universe floats past somewhere up above my heart a tiny little seed is sown a government is overthrown who knows when we'll be coming home at last and i heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars and i heard it on a tv show that somewhere up above and in my heart they'll be tearing us apart maybe moving us to mars past the satellites and stars maybe moving us to mars we won't see the earth again in these seconds just remain unchanged 8 to 9 9 to 10 we are meeting for the first time we might never meet again you and me we are meeting for the first time can't you see 76543 we are meeting for the first time singing this space symphony they'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars past the satellites and stars they're moving us to mars
