met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast she said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast drove around for a while smoked a few cigarettes took her back to my place she slipped off her party dress she sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin loose change in my pocket loose change in my pocket pint of gin in my boot cuff i'm drivin for a drink and a dance sittin on the next stool miss a little time on her hands yeah i knew she was trouble but trouble sure was lookin fine and when i pulled her close what i knew kinda slipped my mind we lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling loose change in my pocket loose change in my pocket i pour another drink wait for the night to get through stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue now i'm sittin at a red light i feel somethin tickin way down the night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town got my bags packed in the back and i'm tryin to get going again but red just goes to green and green goes red and then then all i hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking loose change in my pocket loose change in my pocket
