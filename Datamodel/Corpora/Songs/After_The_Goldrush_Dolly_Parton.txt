well i dreamed i saw the knight in armor coming saying something about a king there were peasants singing and drummers drumming and the archer split the tree there was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze look at mother nature on the run in the twenty-first century look at mother nature on the run in the twenty-first century i was lying in a burned out basement with the full moon in my eyes i was hoping for replacement when the sun burst through the sky there was a band playing in my head and i felt like i could cry i was thinking about what a friend had said i was hoping it was a lie thinking about what a friend had said i was hoping it was a lie well i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flyin in the yellow haze of the sun there was laughing crying and colors flying all around the chosen one all in a dream all in a dream the loading had begun flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun they were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home
