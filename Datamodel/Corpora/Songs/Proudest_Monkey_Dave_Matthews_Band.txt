swing in this tree oh i am bounce around so well branch to branch limb to limb you see all in a day's dream i'm stuck like the other monkeys here i am a humble monkey sitting up in here again but then came the day i climbed out of these safe limbs ventured away walking tall head high up and singing i went to the city car horns corners and the gritty now i am the proudest monkey you've ever seen monkey see monkey do then comes the day staring at myself i turn to question me i wonder do i want the simple simple life that i once lived in well oh things were quiet then in a way they were the better days but now i am the proudest monkey you've ever seen monkey see monkey do monkey see monkey do
