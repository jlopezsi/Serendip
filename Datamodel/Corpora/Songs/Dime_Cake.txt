in the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel in the dark and dusty corner by the tv shelf is a small reminder of a simpler time when a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime well you ask me how i made it through and how my mint condition could belong to you when i'm on the ground i roll through town i'm a president you don't remember getting kicked around i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine i'm freshly minted i am determined not to be dented by a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine in the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds as the afternoon commuters drive their cars around there's a ringle jingle near the underpass there's a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine i'm freshly minted i'm silver-plated i'm underrated you won't even pick me up because i'm not enough for a local phone call i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine i'm a dime i'm fine and i shine
