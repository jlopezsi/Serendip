i got no regret right now i'm feeling this the air is so cold and low i'm feeling this let me go in his room i'm feeling this i want to take off his clothes i'm feeling this show me the way to bed i'm feeling this show me the way you move i'm feeling this fuck it it's such a blur i'm feeling this i love all the things you do i'm feeling this fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna where do we go from here turn all the lights down now smiling from ear to ear i'm feeling this our breathing has got too loud i'm feeling this show me the bedroom floor i'm feeling this show me the bathroom mirror i'm feeling this were taking this way too slow i'm feeling this take me away from here i'm feeling this fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna this place was never the same again after you came and went how can you say you meant anything different to anyone standing alone on the street with a cigarette on the first night we met look to the past and remember your smile and maybe tonight i can breathe for awhile i'm not in this scene i think i'm falling asleep but then all that it means is i'll always be dreaming of you fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna fate fell short this time your smile fades in the summer place your hand in mine i'll leave when i wanna are we alone do you feel it so lost and disillusioned
