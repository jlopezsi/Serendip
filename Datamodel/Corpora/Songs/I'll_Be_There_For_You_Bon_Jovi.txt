i guess this time you're really leaving i heard your suitcase say goodbye and as my broken heart lies bleeding they say true love is suicide you say you've cried a thousand rivers and now you're swimming for the shore you left me drowning in my tears and you won't save me anymore now i'm praying to god you'll give me one more chance girl i'll be there for you these five words i swear to you when you breathe i want to be the air for you i'll be there for you i'd live and i'd die for you steal the sun from the sky for you words can't say what love can do i'll be there for you i know you know we've had some good times now they have their own hiding place i can promise you tomorrow but i can't buy back yesterday and baby you know my hands are dirty but i wanted to be your valentine i'll be the water when you get thirsty baby when you get drunk i'll be the wine i'll be there for you these five words i swear to you when you breathe i want to be the air for you i'll be there for you i'd live and i'd die for you steal the sun from the sky for you words can't say what love can do i'll be there for you and i wasn't there when you were happy i wasn't there when you were down i didn't mean to miss your birthday baby i wish i'd seen you blow those candles out i'll be there for you these five words i swear to you when you breathe i want to be the air for you i'll be there for you i'd live and i'd die for you steal the sun from the sky for you words can't say what love can do i'll be there for i'll be there for you these five words i swear to you when you breathe i want to be the air for you i'll be there for you i'd live and i'd die for you steal the sun from the sky for you words can't say what love can do i'll be there for you
