i've spent my life lookin for you findin my way wasn't easy to do but i knew there was you all the while and it's been worth every mile chorus so lay down beside me love me and hide me and kiss all the hurtin of this world away hold me so close that i feel your heart beat and don't ever wander away mornings and evenings all were the same there was no music till i heard your name i knew when i saw you smile and now i can rest for a while chorus and hold me so close that i feel your heart beat and don't ever wander away love me and hide me till i feel your heart beat
