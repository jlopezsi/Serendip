it's you i'm in love with it's not what you are it's not how you treat me or your fancy car but there's something about you i keep yearning for i i do really love you just thinking about you gives me such a thrill let alone to be with you or know that i will and know that i'll tremble when i should be still um um i i do really love you give me what i live for your sweet lips pressed to me and transform this yearning into ecstasy and send me oh send me most humbly um um i i do really love you
