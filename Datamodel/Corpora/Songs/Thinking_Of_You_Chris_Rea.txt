3 30 somewhere in this crazy night with all this noise and all this light i'm out upon the crowded street i play the game and i keep the beat woo-oo but i'm thinking of you woo-oo but i'm thinking of you and i remember the summer days your strenght and yet your gentle ways now i'm back on the crowded street through the darker days i keep the beat woo-oo but i'm thinking of you woo-oo but i'm thinking of you through all the grey i see skies of blue i close my eyes cause i'm thinking of you and i pray to god that what we had we will have again someday so i telephoned to tell you what i'd hoped you'd like to hear me say woo-oo but i'm thinking of you woo-oo but i'm thinking of you written and performed by chris rea vocals guitars bass by silvan marc keyboards by max middleton drums and percussion by martin ditcham transcribed by iiti
