by the light of the moon to a 50's tune he pledged his love to her a girl so rare a girl so fair the girl for him for sure he could see himself getting up every mornin for the rest of his life just to look in those eyes so blue it was all he ever wanted to do she was all he'd ever need to see him through they were still in their teens when he gave her the ring they were married late one may and they moved into a little house on the far end of town out by the big highway and all through the days and all through the nights the cars and trucks rolled on by and he slept through it all just fine every night he slept just fine sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window sometimes she'd walk neath the moon sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping hoping the dawn would come soon she'd done well in school she'd followed the rules and she'd always stood out from the rest she'd go off to college and work her way through then move to some city out west she had it all planned she'd have her career she'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked she'd wake up one morning all packed and leave here and never look back most of her friends thought it soon would be over not many thought it would last most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other and soon it would pass soon it would pass now twenty years have gone and her kids have moved on and she's still on the far end of town her youngest she's livin somewhere in l a and her oldest he works on a nearby farm her husband comes home and they talk over supper he's usually the first to turn in another day comes to an end another day just ends and sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down she'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing and she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture but not at the ring not at the ring she never looks at the ring
