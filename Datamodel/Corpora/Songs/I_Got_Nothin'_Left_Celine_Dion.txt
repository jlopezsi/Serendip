anybody ever tell you that you're not whole a hollow shell of man without a soul never ever felt your warmth cause you're always cold only thing that makes sense is letting go anybody ever tell you that you've got nerve treatin my love like just another word tired of giving love to you that you don't deserve so this is one way of saying it's over chorus cause i got nothing left i got nothing left i got nothing left i gave you my best and you treated it worthless so i got nothing left anybody ever tell you that you're gonna learn trust and respect are two things you must earn when it came to lovin me you just weren't concerned you never gave a damn so i guess now it's my turn chorus so done with you maybe we're through so done with you chorus so done with you so done with you
