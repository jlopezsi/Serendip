there are angels singing low inside my head cool tango blue and samba red i want to scratch your name upon my wall cause i'm drowning here beneath love's waterfall deep water deep water baby you're love's got a hold on me you row my boat right out to the sea see the woman inside the girl dancing on the roof of the invisible world we are walking like the waves beside the sea there are oceans in my eyes that you can't see and my arms reach out for you into the dark i feel your skin where my nails left their mark deep water deep water baby you're love's got a hold on me you row my boat right out to the sea see the woman inside the girl dancing on the roof of the invisible world souls alike hands alike baby you're love's got a hold on me you row my boat right out to the sea see the woman inside the girl dancing on the roof of the invisible world baby you're love's got a hold on me you row my boat right out to the sea see the woman inside the girl dancing on the roof of the invisible world souls alike hands alike
