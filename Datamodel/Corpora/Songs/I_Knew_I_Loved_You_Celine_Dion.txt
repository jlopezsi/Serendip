i knew i loved you before i knew you the hands of time would lead me to you an evening star watched from afar it guided me here it knew you'd be here now wrapped in moonlight at last together here in the incandescent glow we are all we need to know as we softly please each other til the stars and shadows glow and we sing with our dreams among us ahhhhhhhh ohhhhahhhhhhhh it guided me here it knew you'd be here i knew i loved you before i found you and you had built my world around you now all my days they're now my nights and my tomorrows will all begin and end with you ooooooo
