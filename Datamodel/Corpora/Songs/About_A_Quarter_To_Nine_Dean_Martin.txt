the stars are gonna twinkle and shine this evening about a quarter to nine my loving arms are gonna tenderly twine twee twee twine around you around a quarter to nine i know i won't be late cause at half past eight i'm gonna hurry there i'll be waiting where the lane begins waiting for you on needles and pins and then the world is gonna be mine oh all mine this evening about a quarter to nine then the world is gonna be mine this evening about a quarter to nine
