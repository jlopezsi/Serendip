chorus ain't nothing like the real thing baby ain't nothing like the real thing no no ain't nothing like the real thing baby ain't nothing like the real thing oh honey i've got your picture hanging on the wall but it can't see or come to me when i call your name i realize it's just a picture in a frame i read your letters when you're not here but they don't move me and they don't groove me like when i hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear don't you know ain't nothing like the real thing baby ain't nothing like the real thing no no i play my game of fantasy and i pretend that i'm not in reality i need the shelter of your arms to comfort me no other sound is quite the same as your name no touch can do half as much to make me feel better so let's stay together i've got the memories to look back on and though they help me when you're gone i'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there so glad we've got the real thing baby so glad we've got the real thing oh darling ain't nothing like the real thing baby ain't nothing like the real thing tell tell me ain't nothing like the real thing baby ain't nothing like the real thing
