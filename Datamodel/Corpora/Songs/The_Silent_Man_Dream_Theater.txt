a question well served is silence like a fever a voice never heard or a message with no receiver pray they won't ask behind the stained glass there's always one more mask has man been a victim of his woman of his father if he elects not to bother will he suffocate their faith desperate to fall behind the great wall that separates us all when there is reason tonight i'm awake when there's no answer arrive the silent man if there is balance tonight he's awake if they have to suffer there lies the silent man sin without deceivers a god with no believers i could sail by on the winds of silence and maybe they won't notice but this time i think it'd be better if i swim when there is reason tonight i'm awake when there's no answer arrive the silent man if there is balance tonight he's awake if they have to suffer there lies the silent man there lies the silent man
