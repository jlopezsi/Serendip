our little boy is four years old and quite a little man so we spell out the words we don't want him to understand like t-o-y or maybe s-u-r-p-r-i-c-e but the words we're hiding from him now tear the heart right out of me our d-i-v-o-r-c-e becomes final today me and little j-o-e will be goin away i love you both and this will be pure h-e double l for me oh i wish that we could stop this d-i-v-o-r-c-e watch him smile he thinks it's christmas or his 5th birthday and he thinks c-u-s-t-o-d-y spells fun or play i spell out all the hurtin words and turn my head when i speak cause i can't spell away this hurt that's drippin down my cheek our d-i-v-o-r-c-e becomes final today me and little j-o-e will be goin away i love you both and this will be pure h-e double l for me oh i wish that we could stop this d-i-v-o-r-c-e
