looking at your picture from when we first met you gave me a smile that i could never forget and nothing i could do could protect me from you that night wrapped around your finger always on my mind the days would blend cause we stayed up all night yeah you and i were everything everything to me chorus i just want you to know that i've been fighting to let you go some days i make it through and then there's nights that never end i wish that i could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me but still i have to say i would do it all again just want you to know all the doors are closing i'm tryin to move ahead and deep inside i wish it's me instead my dreams are empty from the day the day you slipped away i just want you to know that i've been fighting to let you go some days i make it through and then there's nights that never end i wish that i could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me but still i have to say i would do it all again just want you to know that since i lost you i lost myself no i can't fake it there's no one else chorus x2
