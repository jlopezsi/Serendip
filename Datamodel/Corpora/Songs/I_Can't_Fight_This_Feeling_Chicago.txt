i can't fight this feeling any longer yet i'm still afraid to let it flow what started out as friendship has grown stronger i only wish i had the strength to let it show i tell myself that i can't hold out forever i say there is no reason for my fear cause i feel so secure when we're together you give my life direction you make everything so clear even as i wander i'm keeping you in sight you're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might and i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forever cause i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fightin for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through the door baby i can't fight this feeling anymore my life has been such a whirl wind since i saw you i've been running around in circles in my mind and it always seems that i'm following you girl cause you take me to the places that i thought i'd never find even as i wander i'm keeping you in sight you're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night and i'm getting closer than i ever though i might and i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fighting for it's time to bring this ship into the shore and through away the oars forever cause i can't fight this feeling anymore i've forgotten what i started fightin for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through your door baby i can't fight this feeling anymore oohhhh
