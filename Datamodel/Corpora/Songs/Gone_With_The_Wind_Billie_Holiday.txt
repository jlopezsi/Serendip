gone with the wind just like a leaf that has blown away gone with the wind my romance has flown away yesterday's kisses are still on my lips i had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips now all is gone gone is the rapture that filled my heart gone with the wind the gladness that thrilled my heart just like a flame love burned brightly then became an empty smoke dream that has gone with the wind
