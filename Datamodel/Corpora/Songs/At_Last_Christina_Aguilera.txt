at last my love has come along my lonely days over and life is like a song at last the skies above are blue well my heart was wrapped up in clover the night i looked at you i found a dream that i could speak to a dream that i could call my own i found a thrill to press my cheek to a thrill that i have never known well you smile you smile oh and then the spell was cast and here we are in heaven for you are mine at last i found a dream that i could speak to a dream that i could call my own i found a thrill to press my cheek to a thrill that i have never known well you smile you smile oh and then the spell was cast and here we are in heaven for you are mine at last ooo yea you are mine you are mine at last at last at last at last
