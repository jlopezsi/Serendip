when love is new and the world is out reaching for you we try hard to hold it all in our hands but it slips through like soft drifting sands but drying the tears can build it all like new chorus now and forever remember the words from my heart will always be true now and forever together and all that i feel here's my love for you learning each day that the right time was so far away to tell you the things i knew now it's clear that the moment we searched for is here and counting the years is all i want to do chorus hold me as close as love will allow until all your fears are gone what has all passed is over now i'm here with you i'm here with you i'm holding on i'm holding on is my love for you chorus
