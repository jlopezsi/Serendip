where are you i love you where are you i love you where are you to keep me warm i had a dream of a place far away i followed a river where the dead man would play and i'm leaving in the morning and i'm leaving in the morning and i won't die so don't cry i'll be home those big black diamonds that lie there for me by the tall white mountains which lie by the sea and you a man who's as tall as the sky followed a river where thousands have died he was leaving in the morning he was leaving in the morning if i come home and my women has flown those big black diamonds that lie there for me by the tall white mountains which lie by the sea oh oh oh oh oh say goodbye to auld lang syne repeat until fade
