i've been thinking it over so many times they say you got it made they never understand the answer lies within your soul cause no one know which side the coin will fall big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning turning save it for a rainy day for when the cold wind blows just to see how they run i thought they'd know i tried my best all i could do but somehow it was not enough for you big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning turning turning turning i remember the dead of night a lonely light that shines upon the window i see it all so clear the tenderness the silent tears out here in the pouring rain through cold dark waiting days i see you standing there i see the big wheels turning never ending on and on they go i think i'm going home i think i'm gonna have to start again it's rather sad because i've looked around can't seem to find whatever's always rolling through my mind big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning baby i know big wheels turning turning turning turning i remember the dead of night a lonely light that shines upon the window i see it all so clear the tenderness the silent tears out here in the pouring rain through cold dark waiting days i see you standing there i see the big wheels turning never ending on and on they go
