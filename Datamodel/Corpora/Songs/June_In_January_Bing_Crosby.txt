a clouded moon creeps across the clouded sky winds of january sigh and moan and yet it's june i can see a sky of blue dear the miracle is due to you just you it's june in january because i'm in love it always is spring in my heart with you in my arms the snow is just white blossoms that fall from above and here is the reason my dear your magical charms the night is cold the trees are bare but i can feel the scent of roses in the air it's june in january because i'm in love but only because i'm in love with you oh the night is cold won't it be too bare but i can feel the scent of roses in the air it's june in january because i'm in love but only because i'm in love with you
