you passed me by one sunny day flashed those big brown eyes my way and oh i wanted you forever more now i'm not one that gets around i swear my feet stuck to the ground and though i never did meet you before chorus i said hello mary lou goodbye heart sweet mary lou i'm so in love with you i knew mary lou we'd never part so hello mary lou goodbye heart i saw your lips i heard your voice believe me i just had no choice wild horses couldn't make me stay away i thought about a moonlit night my arms about good an tight that's all i had to see for me to say chorus
