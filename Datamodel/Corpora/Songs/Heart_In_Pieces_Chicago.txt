only you can touch me with your dark eyes with a look that burns like fire through the lonely night sometimes i run but i can never hide from the pieces of my heart that fall like rain from the sky when you hear the thunder when you hear the sound of a mountain crashing down it's just my heart in pieces when i feel the hunger when i'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands it's my heart in pieces no one cuts through my soul like you can i'm naked to the bone beside your empty hand i see your face and i remember i'm a prisoner of your fate i'm a loser in the race when you hear the thunder when you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down it's just my heart in pieces when i feel the hunger when i'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands it's my heart in pieces i walk the fine line between fire and the ice the memory lives on there's always something to remind me every teardrop falling when your voice keeps calling when you hear the thunder when you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down it's just my heart in pieces when i feel the hunger when i'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands it's my heart in pieces
