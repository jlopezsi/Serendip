at last my love has come along my lonely days are over and life is like a song at last the skies above are blue my heart was wrapped in clover the night i looked at you and i found a dream that i can speak to a dream that i can call my own i found a thrill to press my cheek to a thrill that i have never known you smile and then the spell was cast and here we are in heaven for you are mine at last oh you smile and then the spell was cast and here we are in heaven for you are mine at last
