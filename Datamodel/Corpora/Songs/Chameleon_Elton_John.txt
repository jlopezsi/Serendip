the last i heard of you you were somewhere on a cruise in the mediterranean so imagine my surprise to see you very much alive in the english rain again and i can still recall wet afternoons when we were small and simply childish but you've created your own ghost and the need you have is more than most to hide it oh chameleon you're stealing your way back into my eyes beyond a shadow of a doubt you're a devil you're a devil in disguise do you really change me or am i going crazy chameleon chameleon chameleon you're free again my child i remember still those lazy summer days we'd kill out hunting danger and we were alien to all outsiders we had no desire to talk to strangers
