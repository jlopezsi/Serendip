well hello mr soul i dropped by to pick up a reason for the thought that i caught that my head was the event of the season why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin i'll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on i was down on the ground when the messenger wrote me a letter i was raised by the praise of a fan who said i upset her any girl in the world could have easily known me much better she said you're strange but don't change and i let her in a while when the smile on my face turned to plaster stick around while the clown who gets sick does the trick of disaster for the race of my head and my face is moving much faster is it strange i should change i don't know why don't you ask her is it strange i should change i don't know why don't you ask her is it strange i should change i don't know why don't you ask her is it strange i should change why don't you ask her fade out
