there's a fly in the window a dog in the yard and a year since i saw you there's a trunk in the corner i keep all my letters my bills and demands i keep too well i can't help thinking about the times you were a wife of mine you aimed to please me cooked black-eyed peas-me made elderberry wine chorus drunk all the time feeling fine on elderberry wine those were the days we'd lay in the haze forget depressive times how can i ever get it together without a wife in line to pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine round a tree in the summer a fire in the fall flat out when they couldn't stand the bottle went round like a woman down south passed on from hand to hand chorus
