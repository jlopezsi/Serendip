you played the part of miss hard-to-get and somehow you knew that i couldn't forget and though i don't think in terms of two i got it bad for you and when you passed me along the way i couldn't speak so you didn't stay and though i don't think in terms of two you're breaking my heart shaking me all apart breaking my heart shaking me all apart again when it appeared to me i was down and nothing i did could bring me around and though i don't think in terms of two i saw it there in you so now if you'd only understand that without you here i'd be half of a man and though i don't think in terms of two you're breaking my heart shakin me all apart breaking my heart shakin me all apart again because of you because of me the time's not right i disagree before you leave i want you to see woah what you've done to me
