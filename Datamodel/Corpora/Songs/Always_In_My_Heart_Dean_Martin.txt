you are always in my heart even though you're far away i can hear the music of the song i sang to you you are always in my heart and when skies above are gray i remember that you care and then and there the sun breaks through just before i go to sleep there's a rendezvous i keep and the dreams i always meet help me forget we're far apart i don't know exactly when dear but i'm sure we'll meet again dear and my darling til we do you are always in my heart and the dreams i always meet help me forget were far apart i don't know exactly when dear but i'm sure we'll meet again dear and my darling til we do you are always in my heart
