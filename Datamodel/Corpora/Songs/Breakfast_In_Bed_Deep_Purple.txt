woke up this morning rain coming down washing the sin from the street sometimes i feel like i'm losing ground just trying to make ends meet well i work every day to sweat out my dreams won't you show me that you understand it's only my life whatever that means and you've got it all in your hands i need someone to pull me through won't you take the pain from my head give me all your loving the way you always do give me breakfast in bed i feel like the good days are numbered and my nights are getting too long my hopes and my fears take their toll on the years and my willpower's almost gone well it's a time full of trouble a time of desperate need sometimes life don't make sense fighting the anger jealousy and greed one day i'll look back and wonder where it all went i need someone to pull me through won't you take the pain from my head give me all your loving the way you always do give me breakfast in bed it don't take much to please me i'm just a simple man won't you please believe me i gotta tell you it don't take much a tender touch so baby do the best that you can
