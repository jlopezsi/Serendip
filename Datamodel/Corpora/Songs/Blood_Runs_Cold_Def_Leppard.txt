i heard this line one time bout tryin to save the world but have you ever tried to save yourself a wide-eyed suicide drive remains a fake as if you'd ever ever go and make the same mistake strung out as the night comes crawlin your halo of thorns is fallin chorus blood runs cold i feel it in my bones but you don't know your time is up blood runs cold somebody somewhere is screamin out the words but do they ever really ease the pain i guess what i'm trying to say is whose life is it anyway because livin living is the best revenge you can play this fall from grace i see your face it's over chorus from you love was kind resolved left scarred and blind wasted and naked in the wings denying twist of fate demanding heaven's gate lying in wait above the wind strung out as the night comes crawlin your halo of thorns is fallin chorus blood runs cold blood runs cold
