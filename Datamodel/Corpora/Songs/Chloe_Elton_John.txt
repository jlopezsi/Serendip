how come you're so understanding when i tell you all my lies and pretending to believe them see through all my alibis and i need you more than ever and i want you till the end chloe how you handle what you live through i can never hope to learn taking all the pain i give you loving blindly in return and i need you more than ever i will always be your friend chloe chloe chorus chloe what you gonna do about me chloe what you gonna do what you gonna do about me you're the lifeline that i cling to when i feel like giving in when the dreams that i rely on start to wear a little thin then i need you more than ever and i want you till the end chloe chloe chorus
