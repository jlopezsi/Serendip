and when i see the sign that points one way the lot we used to pass by every day just walk away renee you won't see me follow you back home the empty sidewalks on my block are not the same you're not to blame from deep inside the tears i forced to cry from deep inside the pain i chose to hide just walk away renee you won't see me follow you back home now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes for me it cries just walk away renee you won't see me follow you back home now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes for me it cries your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall still find a way to haunt me though they're so small just walk away renee you won't see me follow you back home the empty sidewalks on my block are not the same you're not to blame
