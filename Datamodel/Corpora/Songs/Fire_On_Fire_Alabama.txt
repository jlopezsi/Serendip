he was a stranger in a little town she was sittin alone in a crowd listening to the old jukebox playin a song from the moment we walked through the diner door she felt something like never before a feelin so strong right from the start it wouldn't stop it was more than a spark chorus fire on fire they were burnin up over a coffee cup under the table they touched fire on fire in each others eyes they just had to try cause fire on fire just won't die it was gettin late but they had all night they sat there talkin bout their lives he was sellin she uas gettin ready to buy that ole neon light was glowin dim but he could see by the way she was lookin at him tonight would be different somethin had changed his lonely heart was feelin a flame repeat chorus bridge she needed him he needed her and they both knew without a word there was no question there was no doubt there was no way they could put it out fire on fire they were burnin up over a coffee cup under the table they touched fire on fire in each other's eyes they just had to try cause fire on fire fire on fire fire on fire just won't die tag fire on fire just won't die fire on fire
