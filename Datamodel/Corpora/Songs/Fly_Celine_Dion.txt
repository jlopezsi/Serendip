fly fly little wing fly beyond imagining the softest cloud the whitest dove upon the wind of heaven's love past the planets and the stars leave this lonely world of ours escape the sorrow and the pain and fly again fly fly precious one your endless journey has begun take your gentle happiness far too beautiful for this cross over to the other shore there is peace forevermore but hold this memory bittersweet until we meet fly fly do not fear don't waste a breath don't shed a tear your heart is pure your soul is free be on your way don't wait for me above the universe you'll climb on beyond the hands of time the moon will rise the sun will set but i won't forget fly fly little wing fly where only angels sing fly away the time is right go now find the light
