baby i'm through runnin it's true i'd be a fool to try to escape you maybe i'm beat but oh what a sweet surrender you keep your rights i'll take your nights no one can lose when we turn the lights out tastin defeat lovin that sweet surrender i'm givin up myself to you but i didn't really lose at all i gave the only love i've known and it never hurt me to fall now that it's done so glad you won i know our lives have only begun now no more retreat only my sweet surrender
