how many tears do you cry if love should break your heart in two how many tears will i cry now that i know i'm losing you i can't stop wanting you and no matter what you do you're still a part of me even though i'm losing you oh how many years will go by before my heart begins to mend waiting and wondering why i never thought our love could end i try forgetting you but you're still here on my mind it would take a miracle but someday maybe i'll find that i'm in the loving arms of someone that i'll know know he's the someone who'll kiss all the heartache away and come that day i won't mind losing you yes i try forgetting you but you're still here on my mind it would take yeah a miracle but someday maybe i'll find that i'm in the loving arms of someone that i'll know know he's the someone who'll kiss all the heartache away and when he comes to me that day i won't mind losing you oh oh i won't mind losing you yeah i won't mind losing you
