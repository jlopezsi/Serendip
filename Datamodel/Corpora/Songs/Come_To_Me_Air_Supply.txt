if you come to me that's all that i remember come to me before i fade away here we are how did we come so far just tell me how you are i need to know night has come to see the senses run and every single one we all must show and when you feel the flood upon the waters edge and take the leap from bitter sweet do you believe do you believe do you still believe if you come to me that's all that i remember come to me before i fade away if you come to me and wrap me in your splendour come to me and let the music play in the sea of those eyes in the fall of the rise there is no compromise if you come to me that's all that i remember won't you come to me before i fade away if you come to me and wrap me in your splendour come to me and let the music play won't you come to me
