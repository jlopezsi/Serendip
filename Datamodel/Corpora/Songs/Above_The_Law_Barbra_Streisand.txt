this is me talking to you tell me what your heart can do and take me by surprise whatever you see you'll never be alone with me i close or open the door telling you that less is more you cannot disguise whatever you do no one is above the law in these dark and troubled times people just surviving we live a double life you'd be safe and warm at home something else is going on we don't have to kiss and say no more about it and if your eyes are watching me baby life could be so beautiful and we become invisible the pleasure is the punishment for the crime break away the chains that bind it's not enough to be satisfied it's knowing how it all begins or knowing where the heart belongs and we all make mistakes it's your heart and my heart and no one can take part and our love love above the law so you decide we go insane i know what you came here for whether you're mine i'll never be sure we'll ever be above the law on this dark and stormy night where these walls may hide us the walls may hide us you sigh and let me in you let me hold you in these arms of mine one flame inside tomorrow is eternity temtation eyes and we may get to kiss and say no more about it no tears to cry and if my eyes are watching you baby life could be so beautiful so beautiful and everything is possible everything is possible and we become invisible we become invisible it's your heart and my heart and no one can take part i'll always be with you it's what i'm living for the end of my rainbow is outside your window and our love is one love love above the law love above the law it's your heart and my heart and no one can take part i'll always be with you it's what i'm living for it's what i'm living for the end of my rainbow is outside your window love above the law
