i'm driftin down the street asking of all i meet don't you know me from somewhere hazel eyes and curly hair have you seen me anywhere look at me i'm blending into the wall and i wonder if i'm really here at all time goes by so do i but no one blinks an eye mirrors aren't reflecting me laws aren't protecting and no one's expecting me on the edge i feel like i'm going to fall and i wonder if i'll never land at well loneliness comes and stays torturing nights and days people stare but cannot speak hearts are strong but tongues are weak maybe all our minds are meek look at me i'm fading into the floor and wonder if i'm living anymore
