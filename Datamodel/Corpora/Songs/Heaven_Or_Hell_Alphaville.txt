once i awoke the shadow of your smile had crossed my mind how could i know this was your last goodbye that's slipping through the windmills of the night you never understand when she's talking to you little boy you never understand when she's talking to you she's too far away is it heaven or hell we're drifting in the wake of our dreams and the world is a clown who cries and no one can tell is it real once i cried whenever i awoke without you a stranger in the thunder of the dark i'm praying to the sun to shine tonite you never understand when she's talking to you mon amour you never understand when she's talking to you she's too far away
