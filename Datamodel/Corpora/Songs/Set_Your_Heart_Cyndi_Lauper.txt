when your heart is beating black and blue and a cold world's looking back at you when you're fading low around the bend go on turn around you'll see me i will always be your friend set your heart free set your heart free said you can't say much about today just that dark cloud coming back your way and that your dreams are all worn thin well you better stop with all that talk before it all starts happening set your heart free listen to your heart when your heart is beating black and blue and the old world's knocking down on you and you're starting to become unglued don't go there come on you know i love you set your heart free repeats
