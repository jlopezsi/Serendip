i didn't really walk away i had something to explain trying to reach you night and day when i did not know your name shall we promise just to talk of it alone all alone why can't the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight whisper the words i need to know speak to me that way tonight let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you come to me today chorus one step closer forward motion one step nearer our destination one step closer forward motion one step nearer our destination how can i bring myself to sleep till i'm resting by your side sharing the secrets hard to keep when you live them all through the night and then wake up with the words i'll always want you to say come to me today chorus a lonely man has come undone is it wrong to think i understand when you are as close to me and not much further to go let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you come to me today chorus
