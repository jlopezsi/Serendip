fanny i often wonder why he came to me brought such a flame to me then let it die and if another love should find my heart it will remind my heart of your goodbye with every new love you'll come back to me in other eyes it's you i see if i love again though it's someone new if i love again it will still be you in someone else's firm embrace i close my eyes but see your face if i love again i'll find another charms but i'll make believe you are in my arms and though my lips whisper love me my heart will not be true i'll be loving you every time i love again
