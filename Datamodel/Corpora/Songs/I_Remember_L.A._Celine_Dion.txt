i remember l.a seems a lifetime ago we were stars on sunset boulevard what a movie we made there were days in the sun that have stayed forever young nights when passion was invincible we thought love would never die chorus there were moments in that lifetime that my heart still replays there were minutes there were hours there were days there are moments i still love you that same way when i remember l.a i remember goodbye i watched your plane out of sight love was over time to close the book still i go back for one last look chorus
