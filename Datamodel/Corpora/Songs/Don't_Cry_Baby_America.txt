starlight falling through your hair sometimes i wonder if you know i'm there awake in the morning a smile on your face the same old feeling that i just can't place and you say don't cry baby you know i'll always be the one who cares don't cry baby come closer let me wipe away your tears a man came in with a violin he played for me like i've never been courted before and forevermore as the bow touched the strings he made the whole world sing don't cry baby baby don't you cry you know there'll always be someone who cares don't cry baby baby don't you cry come closer let me wipe away your tears i know i've been wrong you've had to be strong i guess i belong to you my baby baby don't you cry you know i'll always be the one who cares don't cry baby baby don't you cry come closer let me wipe away your tears the sound of your voice singing songs in the night have taken me far away and mystified the songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes the words that you'd spoken made me realize
