hanging out behind the club on the weekends acting stupid getting drunk with my best friends i couldn't wait for the summer and the warped tour i remember that it's the first time that i saw her there she's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing i'm kinda nervous cause i think all her friends hate me she's the one she'll always be there she took my hand and i made it i swear chorus because i fell in love with the girl at the rock show she said what and i told her that i didn't know she's so cool better sneak me through her window everything's better when she's around i can't wait until her parents go out of town cause i fell in love with the girl at the rock show when we said we were gonna move to las vegas i remember the look her mother gave us 17 without a purpose or direction we don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation repeat chorus black and white picture of her on my wall i waited for her call she always kept me waiting and if i ever got another chance i'd still ask her to dance because she kept me waiting repeat chorus with the girl at the rock show with the girl at the rock show i'll never forget tonight with the girl at the punk show
