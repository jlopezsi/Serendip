when you first found love was it all that you had wanted for a thousand lonely years was the memory so sweet now your scented touch brings me back to the enchanted all shadows fade away the gypsy is complete chorus someone is walking beside me someone is waiting till i say yes i do someone is living inside me giving me all that i need and i need you someone to cry on my shoulder i just want to stay here forever from the secret pool did i stare at your reflection let the water wash away all the battle from my soul for the bride of spring do i swear to your protection today will be the day that never shall grow old chorus silence broken and the blackbird is free only your voice can i hear speak to me chorus
