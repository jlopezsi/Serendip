walk a cold thin line in the morning hold the fear inside that greets you with the day i can't go with you now i can only watch you now as you sail away sail away i'm going to miss you now so much more then i realised there's a heavy stone of empty where you once lay i can't go with you now i can only watch you now watch you as you sail away sail away i know you need your freedom sail away cause without it you can't survive be on your way disappear into the distance i smile and say sail away i can't go with you now i can only watch you now watch you as you sail away
