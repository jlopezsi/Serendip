it started as a game the bet was on my heart but when i looked away you caught me off guard the tricks were hard to catch but now i see right through no more hurting me no more loving you just wasted all my time empty promises and lies now my fantasy has died i never asked for these broken pieces you left me with you took advantage did so much damage right when you hit you knew just what to target in me when you shot i dropped to my knees how could this be i fell for the enemy a fantastic debut taking part in your masquerade i starred as a fool and while the music played i gave my heart to you boy how was i confused i was only being used i never asked for these broken pieces you left me with you took advantage did so much damage right when you hit you knew just what to target in me when you shot i dropped to my knees how could this be i fell for the enemy i ate the apple off of your tree i can feel the poison running through me i keep getting stronger boy you wish that i was weak but now you're never gonna break me cause i know you're the enemy i never asked for these broken pieces you left me with you took advantage did so much damage right when you hit you knew just what to target in me when you shot i dropped to my knees how could this be that i fell for the enemy i fell for the enemy
