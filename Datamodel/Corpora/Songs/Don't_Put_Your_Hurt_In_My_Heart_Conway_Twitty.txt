don't put your hurt in my heart stop what you're planning before you start yes i loved you once it's true but now i'm over you don't put your hurt in my heart don't put your burning in my eyes cause the burning only stops when i cry once my teardrops fell like rain washed away the burning flame and it washed all your hurt from my heart don't put your sorry in my mind cause it's useless and you're only wasting time i got over you before i can't chance it anymore don't put your hurt in my heart don't put your hurt in my heart
