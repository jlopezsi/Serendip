for a second i was in control i had it once i lost it though and all along the fire below would rise and i wish you could have let me know what's really going on below i've lost you now you let me go but one last time tell me you love me if you don't then lie lie to me remember once upon a time when i was yours and you were blind the fire would sparkle in your eyes and mine so tell me you love me and if you don't then lie lie to me just tell me you love me if you don't then lie lie to me if you don't then lie lie to me and call it true call it true love call it true call it true love
