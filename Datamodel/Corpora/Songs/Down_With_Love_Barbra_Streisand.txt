down with love with flowers and rice and shoes down with love the root of all midnight blues down with things that give you that well-known pain take that moon wrap it in cellophane down with love let's liquidate all it's friends like moon june roses and rainbow's ends down with songs that mourn about night and day down with love take it away away take it away take it away give it back to the birds to bees and the viennese down with eyes romantic and stupid down with sighs down with cupid brother let's stuff that dove down with love down with love liquidate all it's friends like moon june roses and rainbow's ends down with song that mourns about night and day you are the one and i don't stand a chance with a ghost like you ah the promised kiss of spring is here what does my heart go dancin overhead on the ceiling near my bed we go now because i talk to the trees but they don't listen to me i tell them you say either i say i-ther you say neither i say neither i say ni-ther either i-ther neither ni-ther let's call the whole thing off take it away take it away give it back to the birds and the bees and the viennese down with eyes romantic and stupid down with sighs down with cupid brother let's stuff that dove down down down i go on round and round i go in a spin hey in the spin i'm in what is this thing what is this thing called love
