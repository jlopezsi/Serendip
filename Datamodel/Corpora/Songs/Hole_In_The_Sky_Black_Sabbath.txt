i'm looking through a hole in the sky i'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie i'm getting closer to the end of the line i'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine i'm living in a room without any view i'm living free because the rent's never due the synonyms of all the things that i've said are just the riddles that are built in my head hole in the sky take me to heaven window in time through it i fly i've seen the stars disappear in the sun the shooting's easy if you've got the right gun and even though i'm sitting waiting for mars i don't believe there's any future in cause hole in the sky take me to heaven window in time through it i fly yeah i've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast i've seen the western world go down in the east the food of love became the greed of our time but now i'm living on the profits of pride
