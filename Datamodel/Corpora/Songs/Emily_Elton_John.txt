the church bells ring out morning glory when summer bends to the winter's rage emily walks through the cemetery passed a dog in an unmarked grave the old girl hobbles nylons sagging talks to her sisters in the ground i saw a lie in the mirror this morning i heard a prophesy all around and emily they come and go the shadows and the distant sounds but emily don't be afraid when the weight of angels weighs you down emily prays to a faded hero in a little frame clutched to her gown hears the voice of promise in his memory tonight's the night they let the ladder down in a cage sits a gold canary by a wicker chair and a rosewood loom as a soul ascends aboard the evening canary sings to an empty room and emily they come and go the shadows and the distant sounds but emily don't be afraid when the weight of angels weighs you down
