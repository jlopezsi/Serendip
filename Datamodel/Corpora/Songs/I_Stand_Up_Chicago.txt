you'll never lose me to temptation fighting the devil and i beat the dragon too i'm at your rescue i'm your faithful one if it's the last thing that i ever mean to do i'm in deeper than you could know the wise in me won't let it go you can count on me guarantee chorus i stand up i stand up believe in myself if you love somebody stand i stand up i stand up give me a little respect if you need somebody stand out of the shadow yet i'm alright it's not as easy as i know it used to be i don't have time to look behind me i know the truth and it's the truth that set me free one more heart to heart to live for one more time to stop the war inside of me in spite of me chorus x2
