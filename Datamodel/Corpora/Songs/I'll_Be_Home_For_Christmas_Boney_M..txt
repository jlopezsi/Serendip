i'll be home for christmas i'll be home just in time i can't wait till i see you feel your heart next to mine we'll be together again like before you and i all alone i'll hold you close when i walk through that door i'll be home for christmas we can stay by the fire with the lights turned down low we can watch happy children as they play in the snow though i may be far away from you now darling i promise this it wont be long till we're sharing a kiss i'll be home for christmas i'll be home for christmas i'll be home christmas time when you wait christmas morning i'll be there by your side
