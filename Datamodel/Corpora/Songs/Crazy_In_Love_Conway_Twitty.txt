ain't it funny how time steals the feelings from a love affair and there's no place to lay the blame it ain't a case of no one cares helplessly just watch it fade away neither will admit it we're both aching to say ooh i miss the days when we were crazy in love when you weren't so sure of me i had my little jealousies ooh bring back the days when we were crazy in love i need to feel that way again remember when we were crazy in love oh it used to be so easy one touch and you were high and i could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes baby ain't there anything we can do cause i know you're missing me as much as i've been missing you ooh i miss the days when we were crazy in love when you weren't so sure of me i had my little jealousies ooh bring back the days when we were crazy in love i need to feel that way again remember when we were crazy in love we were more than best of friends we were crazy in love crazy in love crazy in love
