so she smiled at you when you saw her today and you're still thinking bout the things she had to say she said leaving you was hard to do and it's sad we had to part but don't let it go to your heart so she told you she thinks of you now and then now you're thinking she might take you back again but it's only cause she's lonely and she's about to fall apart so don't let it go to your heart cause i'm your heart and i can tell you that it doesn't mean a thing she's just like you she hangs on to a helpless hopeless dream she's made the break and it's hard to take as you watch her teardrops start but don't let it go to your heart guitar cause i'm your heart no don't let it go to your heart
