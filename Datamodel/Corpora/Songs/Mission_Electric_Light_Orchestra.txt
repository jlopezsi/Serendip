for many days we travelled from a distant place and time to reach a place they call the planet earth there was to be a celebration on the mission of the sacred heart the planet earth from way up there is beautiful and blue and floating softly through a rainbow but when you touch down things look different here at the mission of the sacred heart chorus watching all the days roll by who are you and who am i on a dirty worn-out sidewalk sits a mother with a baby in her vale of tears she sees no rainbow and someone's singing from a window in the mission of the sacred heart chorus repeat there's a building on a corner in a city in a land on a place they call the planet earth my orders are to sit here and watch the world go by from the mission of the sacred heart chorus repeat
