ain't it strange that we destroy what we embrace and we leave what we seek it's such a shame ain't it strange that we smile when we cry and no one knows why we are here and where we going to ain't it strange we could be we could be so good together ain't it strange that we share what we hate that we break what we love it's such a shame ain't it strange when we pray we betray anyway and no one knows what we are for why we're so tough when we're so fragile ain't it strange ain't it strange still we could fall into a dream i'd wish no one will catch that fall for we could fall for love life is but a dream life is but a dream all the tears in the world not in vain for the pain is gone the shame is washed away when we're all one life is but a dream life is but a dream it's hard to believe after thousands of years the world is still drowning in blood and tears we've been quite advanced but again we fail it is dog eats dog on the ratrace trail it is getting too much and we're getting nowhere while hatred and fear is all that we share i can't take it no more when i'm watching the news we must stick together or we're bound to lose
