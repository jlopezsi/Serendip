hmmmmmm verse the world seems so cold when i face so much all alone a little scared to move on and knowing how fast i have grown and i wander just where i fit in oh the visions alive in my head chorus i will be strong on my own i will see through the rain i will find my way i will keep on traveling this road till i finally reach my dream till i'm living and i'm breathing my destiny verse 2 i can't lt go now even when darkness surrounds but if i hold on yer i will show the world all the things that you never expected to see from little old me,this pittsburgh girl and i wander just where my place is close my eyes and i remind my self this oh yer chorus i will be strong on my own i will see through the rain i will find my way i will keep on traveling this road till i finally reach my dream till i'm living and i'm breathing my destiny it comforts me it keeps me alive each day of my life always guiding me providing me with the hope i desperateley need well i gotta believe there's something out there meant for me o i get on my knees praying i will receive the courage to grow and the faith to love and chorus i will be strong on my own i will see through the rain i will find my way i will keep on traveling this road till i finally reach my dream till i'm living and i'm breathing my destiny yer yer
