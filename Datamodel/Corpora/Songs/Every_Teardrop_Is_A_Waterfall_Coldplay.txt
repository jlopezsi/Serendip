i turn the music up i got my records on i shut the world outside until the lights come on maybe the streets alight maybe the trees are gone i feel my heart start beating to my favourite song and all the kids they dance all the kids all night until monday morning feels another life i turn the music up i'm on a roll this time and heaven is in sight i turn the music up i got my records on from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song don't want to see another generation drop i'd rather be a comma than a full stop maybe i'm in the black maybe i'm on my knees maybe i'm in the gap between the two trapezes but my heart is beating and my pulses start cathedrals in my heart as we saw oh this light i swear you emerge blinking into to tell me it's alright as we soar walls every siren is a symphony and every tear's a waterfall is a waterfall oh is a waterfall oh oh oh is a is a waterfall every tear is a waterfall oh oh oh so you can hurt hurt me bad but still i'll raise the flag oh it was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall every tear every tear every teardrop is a waterfall every tear every tear every teardrop is a waterfall every tear every tear every teardrop is a waterfall
