you were dreamin on a park bench bout a broad highway somewhere when the music from the carillon seemed to hurl your heart out there past the scientific darkness past the fireflies that float to an angel bending down to wrap you in his warmest coat and you ask what am i not doing he says your voice cannot command in time you will move mountains and it will come through your hands still you argue for an option still you angle for your case like you wouldn't know a burning bush if it blew up in your face yeah we scheme about the future and we dream about the past when just a simple reaching out might build a bridge that lasts and you ask what am i not doing he says your voice cannot command in time you will move mountains and it will come through your hands through your hands so whatever your hands find to do you must do with all your heart there are thoughts enough to blow men's minds and tear great worlds apart there's a healing touch to find you on that broad highway somewhere to lift you high as music flyin through the angel's hair don't ask what you are not doing because your voice cannot command in time we will move mountains and it will come through your hands
