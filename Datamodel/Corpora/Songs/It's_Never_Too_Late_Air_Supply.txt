take the river to the highest mountain take the ocean to the farthest sea i'd take back everything i've said to hurt you if you'd come back to me i'd bring you fire from the frozen waters leave a flower neath a fallen tree i'd take back everything i said to scare you away from me two hands can feel so much more that's what i'm loving you for i was too blind to see fear was inside of me i'm not afraid anymore chorus it's never too late it's never too late to forgive and forget tell me that it isn't over tell me that it isn't over i'll never hold you again if a broken wing can still be mended then a foolish heart can still be true take the river to the highest mountain that's where i'll wait for you two hearts can feel so much more that's what i'm loving you for the man that you tried to free is still locked inside of me and your heart must open the door chorus
