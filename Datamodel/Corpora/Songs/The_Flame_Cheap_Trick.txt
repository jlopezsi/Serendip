another night slowly closes in and i feel so lonely touching heat freezing on my skin i pretend you still hold me i'm going crazy i'm losing sleep i'm in too far i'm in way too deep over you i can't believe you're gone you were the first you'll be the last chorus wherever you go i'll be with you whatever you want i'll give it to you whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon remember after the fire after all the rain i will be the flame i will be the flame watching shadows move across the wall feels so frightening i want to run to you i want to call but i've been hit by lightning just can't stand up for falling apart can't see through this veil across my heart over you you'll always be the one you were the first you'll be the last chorus i'm going crazy i'm losing sleep i'm in too far i'm in way too deep over you you'll always be the one you were the first you'll be the last chorus
