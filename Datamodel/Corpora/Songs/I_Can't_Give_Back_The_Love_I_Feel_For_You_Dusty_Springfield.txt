here's a tear for a souvenir and a dream torn at the seams here's a promise that you made to me of love it's more than i'll ever see and then you're free to go but i can't give back the love i feel for you gonna be stuck with it no matter what i do take these eyes that once could see now reflections of my misery and happiness i thought would last is now becoming just a thing of the past but i can't give back the love that's a part of me if you want just a little bit you'll have to take all of me simply adore til the world don't go round no more here's the ring that didn't mean a thing and letters you wrote that gave my young heart hope take the pillow where my dreams were made and the mind where the thought of you stayed but baby you should know that i can't give back the love i feel for you gonna be stuck with it no matter what i do take these arms that held you close and follow up the one you need the most take these hands no good to me that used to touch you so tenderly but i can't give back the love that's a part of me if you want just a little bit you'll have to take all of me no i can't give back the love that i feel for you yeah gonna be stuck with it no matter no matter what i do no i can't give back the love that's a part of me yeah gonna be stuck with it no matter no matter what i what i do gonna get stuck gonna get stuck
