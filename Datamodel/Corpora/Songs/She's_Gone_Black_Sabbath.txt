i've been gone a long long time waiting for you i didn't want to see you go oh no no and now it's hurting so much what can i do i wanted you to be my wife the days are passing slowly since you've gone your memories are all i have yes i have i sit here waiting but you'll never show without you i can't carry on oh my baby you said you'd always love me all of my life and then you said your last goodbye yeah goodbye why the sudden changes why all the lies i should have seen it in your eyes the endless hours of heartache waiting for you my summer love has turned to rain all the pain the silent emptiness of one sided love my life means nothing now you're gone ooh my baby
