was a long and dark december from the rooftops i remember there was snow white snow clearly i remember from the windows they were watching while we froze down below when the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show you'd better lie low chorus if you love me won't you let me know was a long and dark december when the banks became cathedrals and the fox became god priests clutched onto bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles and the cross was held aloft bury me in armour when i'm dead and hit the ground my nerves are poles that unfold chorus i don't want to be a soldier with the captain of some sinking ship would stow far below so if you love me why'd you let me go i took my love down to violet hill there we sat in snow all the time she was silent and still chorus x2
