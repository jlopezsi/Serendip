falling and spinning losing and winning keeping my head watching for signals wearisome vigil was i misled i remember you said that you don't want to forget me it doesn't matter which of our fantasies fled every tomorrow looking to borrow a piece of today run a bit faster here comes the catcher making his play you had better not stay you will soon be surrounded it doesn't matter which of our fantasies stay lonely and winsome calling for someone living right now something is shallow ugly and hollow doesn't even allow you to want to know how you might live for the living give for the giving moment by moment one day at a time it doesn't matter it's nothing but dreaming anyhow
