this big town is a shelter for me i found a place to hide my misery i lost my love so long ago and though my heart is hurting so the one i love will never know as long as i stay in this big town i find the peace of mind that only losers in the game of love can find the years have gone crawling by this hurt i feel will never die somehow i know deep down inside i'll never get away from this big town from this big town in this big town there's a street of misery and on the street there's a dwelling place for me in the darkness of my room i try to sleep but all i do is cry and still i realize that i am ever lucky to be here in this big town so no one else can see just what your cheating heart has done to me the glimmer of the city lights the shadows of the lonely nights will help to hide me while i cry a hundred dreaded tears in this big town in this big town in this big town in this big town in this big town
