i stood and saw the judge's gavel fall and much to my dismay these words i've heard him say i've listened to your story boy and it seems to me you'd be better off if you'll set her free but i love her i love her down on my knees i cry and i don't want to lose her heaven knows i try to make her happy but she wants more than me and i'll take her like she is before i'll set her free steel judge i know she loves me in her own kind of way even though she hurts me a hundred times a day you tell me that it's better that i should set her free but judge what would you do if you were me you see i love her i love her in spite of all she's done and i'll keep right on hoping someday that time will come when she'll decide that she wants only me and i'll take her like she is before i'll set her free
