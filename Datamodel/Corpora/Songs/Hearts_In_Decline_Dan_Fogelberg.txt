nothing lasts foreveri know that this is true but i never knew how true it was til i was losing you maybe i'm a dreamer or maybe i'm a fool but i never thought that love could be so careless or so cruel you wrestle with the reasons but the reasons never rhyme or comfort when the heart is in decline and it doesn't really matter if it's chance or it's design it's going to take some time love don't play no favorites you know there's no one that's immune cause she changes her demeanor like the phases of the moon there ain't no easy answers you know there's only shades of grey but when it's love or it's survival i guess you gotta get away the days stretch on forever and the nights are so unkind and endless when the heart is in decline and it doesn't really matter if it's chance or it's design it's going to take some time it's going to take some time
