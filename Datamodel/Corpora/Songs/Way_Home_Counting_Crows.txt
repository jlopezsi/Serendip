if you don't stop lying on the floor you don't know what your dying for the last thing that you need is imbeciles and indecision the discussion nearly ends she says i'm leaving my friend and i don't wanna see you when i'm walking on my way home it is always on my way home maria quietly talks to me she says adam what do you see the people lying in the hours of imperception and i believe i the ground she says hey what have you found and everything i see is only walking on my way home chorus look at all the silly people out there can't you see oh all the silly people lying crying dying believe me and this is what i see and if you don't amuse me we walk in circles and we walk back between indecision between the currents we will swim and then it's over my friend and everything i see is only walking on my way home look at all the silly people out there can't you see oh all the silly people lying crying d-d-d-dying maria she belongs to me in between the garden and the sea i walk in circles and the women walks right here beside me and if we talk about this town i must say i've been feeling down and i've been sliding all the falls i've seen currents on my way home chorus
