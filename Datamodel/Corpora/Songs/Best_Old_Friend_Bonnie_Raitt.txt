fate is mighty cruel where true love is concerned it seems you give out more than you ever have returned lately i have tried to make it on my own another night has passed looks like i'm bound to be alone bound to be alone now solitude is fine when you really need it when your soul is dry sometimes loneliness can feed it when you need a lover you know there's nothing else will do when you need love most you know it turns it's back on you oh i can make it through without your company i only wish i knew why you won't comfort me i thought that i could count on you to hear me crying out i guess that's one comfort i will learn to do without falling love too easily but never quite so fast so you are not the first and lord you sure won't be the last the thing about the situation that makes me feel so sad i could've been the best old friend that you have ever had i could've been the best old friend that you have ever had
