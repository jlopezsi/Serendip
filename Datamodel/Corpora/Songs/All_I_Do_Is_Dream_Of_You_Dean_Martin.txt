all i do is dream of you the whole night through where the dawn i still go on dreaming of you you're every thought you're everything you're every song i ever sing summer winter autumn and spring and where them all and 24 hours a day let be spent in sweet content dreaming away when skies are gray when skies are blue morning noon and nighttime too all i do the whole day through is dream of you and where them all and 24 hours a day let be spent in sweet content dreaming away when skies are gray when skies are blue morning noon and nighttime too all i do the whole day through is dream of you
