it's so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town stones crumbling under my feet i see smoke for miles around oh it's enough to make you weep all that remains of the main street up in the park on sunday dogs chasing and the children played old man with his head down can't see nothing more around no but he remembers how it used to be back in the old days so nice to see you coming back in this town again it's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea in the afternoon so nice to see you coming back in this town again ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man came down on day when no-one was looking and it stole away the land people running scared losing hands dodging shadows of falling sand buildings standing like empty shells and nobody helping no-one else young child with his hands high ain't able to see no reason why no but he remembers how it used to be back in the old days so nice to see you coming back in this town again it's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through you'd better know what you're going through now you came back here to find your home is a black horizon that you don't recognize evil destruction has taken everything you'd better walk on the side while you're still walking just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance from the people you meet oh lord and you'd better watch your eyes cause if smoke gets in them baby you won't rise again where's it leading to freedom at what cost people needing more and more and it's all getting lost i want back i want back back to the time when the earth was green and there was no high walls and the sea was clean don't stop that sun to shine it's not yours or mine no
