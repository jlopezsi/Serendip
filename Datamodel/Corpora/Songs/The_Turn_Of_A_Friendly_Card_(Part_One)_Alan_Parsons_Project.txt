lead vocal chris rainbow there are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains and a wheel in perpetual motion and they follow the races and pay out the gains with no show of outward emotion and they think it will make their lives easier for god knows up till now it's been hard but the game never ends when your whole world depends on the turn of a friendly card no the game never ends when your whole world depends on the turn of a friendly card there's a sign in the desert that lies to the west where you can't tell the night from the sunrise and not all's the king's horse and all the king's men have prevented the fall of the unwise for they think it will make their lives easier and god knows it's been hard but the game never ends when your whole world depends on the turn of a friendly card no the game never ends when your whole world depends on the turn of a friendly card but a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine as he enters inside the cathedral
