darling there is one thing i must tell you you must know it's so hard to say the words i feel this fancy that i'm on has been going on too long it's time to stop pretending things are real cause i've been living deep in sin i've been living blind and i just don't know what's right or wrong to take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do a chance i might wake up and find you gone blue so blue my love is burning blue any private flame could be a lie blue so blue my love still burns for you but i know i'll only make you cry a thief can only steal from you he cannot break your heart he can never touch the precious things inside someone like you should surely be miles and miles away from me then you'd never care how much i lied so try to understand the pain it takes so long when i explain please don't you forget how much i lied how much i lied
