i'm down and i feel depressed sitting here just waiting for next bus travelling downtown it's a crying shame isn't it the beautiful weather if i could have my way well i would not be working on a day like this i know what i'd like to be as free as a bumble bee take a sip from every flower free as a bumble bee while away each lazy hour what a good life lying laid back like an old railroad bum by the track what a good life living outdoors lie in the grass and chew on a straw
