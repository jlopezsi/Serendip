your eyes reflect the sadness inside your broken heart you're afraid to love again so openly i'd gladly spend my lifetime repairing every part oh that's close enough to love for me and if you're hung up on the memory of some other man when you close your eyes if it's still him you see if i can't have you completely i'll cherish what i can oh that's close enough to love for me pickin up the pieces is hard to do alone and now your mind is set on stayin free i just want to hold you until the hurt is gone oh that's close enough to love for me i just want to hold you until the hurt is gone oh that's close enough to love for me
