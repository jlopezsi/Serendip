i don't know why i just know i do i just can't explain in this language that i use something leaves me speechless each time that you approach each time you glide right through me as if i was a ghost if i only could tell you if you only would listen i've got a line or two to use on you i've got a romance we could christen and there's a word in spanish i don't understand but i heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man he said it with devotion he sounded so sincere and the words he spoke in spanish brought the female lead to tears a word in spanish a word in spanish if you can't comprehend read it in my eyes if you don't understand it's love in a thin disguise and what it takes to move you each time that you resist is more than just a pretty face to prove that i exist when manners make no difference and my gifts all lay undone i trade my accent in on chance and fall back on a foreign tongue
