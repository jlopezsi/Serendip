i'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love make me wish that i had wings take me high above and i looked high and saw the empty sky if i could only i could only fly i'd drift with them in endless space but no man flies from this place at night i lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars the cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far if only i could swing upon those twinkling dots above i'd look down from the heavens upon the ones i love hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck some luck i ever got with you and i wouldn't like to bet that sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land by shining your eyes on the wealth of every man and i looked high and saw the empty sky if i could only i could only fly i'd drift with them in endless space but no man flies from this place just send up my love ain't seen nothing but tears now i've got myself in this room for years i don't see no one i never see anyone
