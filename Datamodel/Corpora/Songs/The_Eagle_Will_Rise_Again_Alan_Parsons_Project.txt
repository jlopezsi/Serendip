and i could easily fall from grace then another would take my place for the chance to behold your face as the days of my life are but grains of sand as they fall from your open hand at the call of the wind's command many words are spoken when there's nothing to say the fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way to read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you all that i ask you is show me how to follow you and i'll obey teach me how to reach you i can't find my own way let me see the light let me be the light as the sun turns slowly around the sky till the shadow of night is high the eagle will learn to fly as the days of his life are but grains of sand as they fall from your open hand and vanish upon the land many words are spoken when there's nothing to say the fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way to read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you show me how to follow you and i'll obey teach me how to reach you i can't find my own way let me see the light let me be the light and so with no warning no last goodbye in the dawn of the morning sky the eagle will rise again
