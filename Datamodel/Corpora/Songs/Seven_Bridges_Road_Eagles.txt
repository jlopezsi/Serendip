there are stars in the southern sky southward as you go there is moonlight and moss in the trees down the seven bridges road now i have loved you like a baby like some lonesome child and i have loved you in a tame way and i have loved you wild sometimes there's a part of me has to turn from here and go running like a child from these warm stars down the seven bridges road there are stars in the southern sky and if ever you decide you should go there is a taste of thyme sweetened honey down the seven bridges road
