i have often told you stories about the way i lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day when i'd take your hand and sing you songs then maybe you would say come lay with me and love me and i would surely stay but i feel i'm growing older and the songs that i have sung echo in the distance like the sound of a windmill going round guess i'll always be a soldier of fortune many times i've been a traveler i looked for something new in days of old when nights were cold i wandered without you but those days i thought my eyes had seen you standing near though blindness is confusing it shows that you're not here now i feel i'm going older and the songs that i have sung echo in the distance like the sound of a windmill going round guess i'll always be a soldier of fortune yes i can hear the sound of a windmill going round i guess i'll always be a soldier of fortune i guess i'll always be a soldier of fortune
