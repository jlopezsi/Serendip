graham russell i never saw it happen i never saw the flame i never new how much there was to lose and gain but when the sun was taken you never shone so bright and from a place we'd long forgotten the blind were given sight if there's one thing i must do it's to say i love you to it's the one thing i'm so sure of chorus if i hold you now from my point of view will you show me how to be close to you if the dawn should break and you're far away can you ever know what i need to say i can see how much i was taking it all for granted among the silent victims only the wind would moan and for a time i felt us touch the great unknown for that eternal moment oh what a price to pay with nothing left but all we have we slowly walked away if there's one thing i must do it's to say i love you too it's the one thing i'm so sure of chorus so give life to your dreams for there lies your survival and cast your heart beyond those faded scenes and i'll bring you through that storm yes i'll bring you back chorus news from nowhere news from nowhere news from nowhere
