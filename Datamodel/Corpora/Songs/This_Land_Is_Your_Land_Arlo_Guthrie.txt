words and music by woody guthrie chorus this land is your land this land is my land from california to the new york island from the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters this land was made for you and me as i was walking a ribbon of highway i saw above me an endless skyway i saw below me a golden valley this land was made for you and me chorus i've roamed and rambled and i've followed my footsteps to the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts and all around me a voice was sounding this land was made for you and me chorus the sun comes shining as i was strolling the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling the fog was lifting a voice come chanting this land was made for you and me chorus as i was walkin i saw a sign there and that sign said no tress passin but on the other side it didn't say nothin now that side was made for you and me chorus in the squares of the city in the shadow of the steeple near the relief office i see my people and some are grumblin and some are wonderin if this land's still made for you and me chorus 2x
