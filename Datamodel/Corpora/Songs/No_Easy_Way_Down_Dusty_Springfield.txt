with the music of life my soul is out of tune and i feel like i'm growing old much too soon my love for you i just couldn't convey and the keys to my happiness i let slip away now i'm a man without a dream i've got a heart that has no hope all my senses are numb losing you i've become a man i'm just a man without a dream instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims i got distracted with meaningless games for just an illusion i traded love that was real now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel now i'm a man without a dream i've got a heart that has no hope all my senses are numb losing you i've become a man i'm just a man without a dream sometimes i think i'm a prisoner of fate doomed to find out things a little too late and so i must play this broken man's role unless you come home girl and bring back my soul cause i'm a man without a dream i've got a heart that has no hope all my senses are numb losing you i've become a man i'm just a man without a dream without a dream without a dream
