you're in-between a page of life you never dreamed the answer won't come from that magazine this time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel who can i trust to say should i give love now should i take love now chorus i'm taking the chance and giving myself to you if something's not right then tell me i'm wrong i just want it all to carry on sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near i needed to make this choice on my own to let love in when i'm so scared when things begin don't run away i feel close to you now you know i need you now chorus i'm taking the chance and giving myself to you if something's not right then tell me i'm wrong i just want it all to carry on i'm taking the chance i can't let this feeling leave i don't want those nights of waiting so long i'm taking the chance before it's gone taking the chance taking the chance taking the chance taking the chance on you chorus
