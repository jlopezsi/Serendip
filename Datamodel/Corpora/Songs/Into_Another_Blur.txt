it starts feeling now it makes no inference of difference it still won't see it's his faint from lack of air it makes a whistle with a twistle but no one can hear i didn't stay long i had to go away to stay as long as i could so i'm happy here cause here is where the heart is i know you think that too into another you and me am i dead sleep in harlow's bed into another you and me am i dead sleep in harlow's bed listening to our tune with headphone and volume on i can read your lips and in a clinical term i hear it said everything is beautiful but nothing hurt into another you and me am i dead sleep in harlow's bed into another you and me am i dead sleep in harlow's bed
