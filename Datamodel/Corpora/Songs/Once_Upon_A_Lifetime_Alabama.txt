once upon a lifetime i looked in someone's eyes and felt the fire burning in my heart for the very first time she was scared and young and had never tasted love so i took her by the hand and a boy became a man once upon a lifetime and once upon a lifetime you hold the queen of hearts and if you gamble on a diamond win the dealin starts you stand to lose it all as the cards begin to fall and the lesson learned is hard you're only dealt the queen of cards once upon a lifetime so if you're taking chances know the chance you take a broken heart's a high price to pay foolish ways will make fools of the wise and the best things seldom come along twice once upon a lifetime you know that you've been blessed when you hold your first born tenderly against your chest and through the innocence you see the value of a family and you feel a special bond that only comes along once upon a lifetime so if you're taking chances know the chance you take a broken heart's a high price to pay foolish ways will make fools of the wise and the best things seldom come along twice and people only find love like yours and mine once upon a lifetime
