seems like such a long time since i held you in my arms and felt you close and warm beside me another night is getting late and i'm alone with just the ache and the memory of you inside me darling i've never been so blue i've tried to see it through there's nothing i can do i won't make it on my own so won't you please hurry home cause nothing seems to matter without you last time i saw you there was nothing we could say we knew it was a time for a change a time to think you said that night and i lied and said all right and i left you in the morning i watched you in the window and mexico will never be the same it was time to be apart but somehow it seems this heart of mine will never find a way to live without you and now i'm out here on the road and i'm feeling bought and sold and tonight i just can't but think about you darling i've never been so blue i've tried to see it through there's nothing i can do i won't make it on my own so darling won't you hurry home because nothing seems to matter without you no nothing seems to matter without you
