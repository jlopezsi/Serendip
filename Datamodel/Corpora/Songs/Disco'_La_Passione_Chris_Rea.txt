i stand alone without a care open the door but no-one's there the lonely night my only friend love's wrongs are right i can't defend la passione la passione la passione la passione and now i know what i've become it haunts me so but i'll go on and on i know the pain inside is the price you pay to ride into the brightest flame never the same again la passione la passione la passione la passione you dare to dream take the chance and go desire has taken hold now the passion haunts you so la passione la passione la passione la passione
