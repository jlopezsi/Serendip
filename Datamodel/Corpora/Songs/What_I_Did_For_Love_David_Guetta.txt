verse 1 talking loud talking crazy locked me outside praying for the rain to come bone dry again guess it's true what they say i'm always late say you need a little space and i'm in your way pre-chorus it hurts but i remember every scar and i've learnt that living is the hardest part i can't believe what i did for love i can't believe what i did for us oh crash and we burn into flames stitch myself up and i'd do it again i can't believe what i did for love what i did for love chorus what i did for love what i did for love what i did for love what i did for love verse 2 i'm a fool for your games but i'd always play can't admit it was a waste just too much at stake pre-chorus it hurts but i remember every scar and i've learnt that living is the hardest part i can't believe what i did for love i can't believe what i did for us oh crash and we burn into flames stitch myself up and i'd do it again i can't believe what i did for love what i did for love chorus what i did for love what i did for love what i did for love what i did for love i can't believe what i did for love
