when my world is turning when it's turning upside down when all i see is rain when i think the night won't end i just think of you and i can see the sun again wherever would i be without you tell me if i didn't have you whatever would i do now baby whatever would i be without you i'd be nowhere i'd be nowhere when the dreams i dream all seem a million miles away when i'm sure i'll never win when it's looking like i've left my faith i just look at you baby and i got reason to believe again wherever would i be without you tell me if i didn't have you whatever would i do now baby whatever would i be without you without you to love me i'd just be wasting time and goin out of my mind wherever would i be without you tell me if i didn't have you whatever would i do now baby whatever would i be without you wherever would i be without you tell me if i didn't have you whatever would i do now baby whatever would i be without you wherever would i be without you tell me if i didn't have you whatever would i do now baby whatever would i be without you
