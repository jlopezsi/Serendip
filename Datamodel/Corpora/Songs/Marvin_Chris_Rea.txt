oh marvin seems so long but i still remember you i would have given everything if i could have talked to you for just one small moment in the quiet of the day you took my pain away oh marvin the one who wanted the one that could not stay with a flash of illusion oh the big one that got away just one small moment in the quiet of the day you took my pain away oh marvin oh marvin oh how we miss you oh how we wish somehow i could hold onto your wings and fly away because the pain you knew was the pain i knew too misunderstood like the thorn of a rose before the summer came your beauty washed away like pretty petals in the wind and rain
