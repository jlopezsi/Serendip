wait for your call love the call never came ready to fall up ready to claim i'm ready for it all love i'm ready for the pain meet under sun and meet me again in the rain in the rain the rain behind the walls love i'm trying to change and i'm ready for it all love i'm ready for the change meet me in blue sky meet me again in the rain the rain in the rain in the rain the rain got to find yourself alone in this world you've got to find yourself alone
