chorus in the corner of my mind stands a jukebox it's playing all my favorite memories one by one they take me back to the days when you were mine and i can't stop this jukebox in my mind i don't need no quarters don't need any dimes you filled it up forever when you said goodbye heaven knows i love old melodies they were meant to ease the pain but the kind that's playing on my mind are driving me insane chorus song by song those melodies were meant to ease the pain but the kind that's playing on my mind are driving me insane chorus tag no i can't stop this jukebox in my mind chorus
