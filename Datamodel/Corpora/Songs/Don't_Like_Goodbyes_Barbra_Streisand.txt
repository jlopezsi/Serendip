it's not easy it's never been easy to let anyone see the sentimental side of me hard as i try i can't help but show it's my heart you're takin as you go don't like goodbyes tears or sighs i'm not too good at leavin time i got no taste for grievin time no no no not me you've been my near one ever my dear one i never thought that you would find another love a different kind but it came to be now that your future is looking up forget the past and go fill your loving cup but remember remember leavin is fine and the world overhead has a clear new shine i won't be grievin now that you're leavin it's travelin time and you must move on found someone that you can lean upon and if i could arrange it oh would i care to change it not me not me
