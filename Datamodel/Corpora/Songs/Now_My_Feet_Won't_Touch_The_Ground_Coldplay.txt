let me go boys let me go push my bone from the highest cliff to the sea below rocks are waiting boys rocks are waiting swoop down from the sky and catch me like the bird to prey now my feet won't touch the ground now my head won't stop you wait a lifetime to be found now my feet won't touch the ground singing now my feet won't touch the ground now my head won't stop you wait a lifetime to be found now my feet won't touch the ground now my feet won't touch the ground
