there's a time a for joy a time for tears a time we'll treasure through the years we'll remember always graduation day at the senior prom we danced til three and there you gave your heart to me we'll remember always graduation day though we leave in sorrow all the joys we've known we can face tomorrow knowing we'll never walk alone when the ivy walls are far behind no matter where our paths may wind we'll remember always graduation day we'll remember always graduation day
