caught in the heat of the night there when things ain't goin right no no no you will remember me i came along to see your face but the only thing i got from you was telling me it's fantasy that you would always be with me i can tell you that it's true i'm waiting here but it's alright it's alright with me you better believe me now i guess it's like a mountain side you gotta climb it to the top floating in a sea of dreams the only thing that you can see is the view above the clouds i'm waiting here but it's alright still it's alright with me you better believe me now
