i was cruisin in my stingray late one night when an xke pulled up on my right he rolled down the window of his shiny new jag and challenged me then and there to a drag i said you're on buddy my mill's running fine let's come of the line now at sunset and vine but i'll go ya one better if you've got the nerve let's race all the way to deadman's curve chorus deadman's curve is no place to play deadman's curve you best keep away deadman's curve i can hear them say you won't come back from deadman's curve the street was deserted late friday night we were buggin each other as we sat out the light we both popped the clutch when the light turned green you shoulda heard the whine from my screamin machine i flew past la brea schwabs and crescent heights and all the jag could see were my six tail lights he passed me at doheny and i started to swerve but i pulled it out and there we were at deadman's curve spoken well the last thing i remember doc i started to swerve and then i saw the jag slide into the curve i know i'll never forget that horrible sight i found out for myself that everyone was right won't come back from deadman's curve repeat chorus and fade
