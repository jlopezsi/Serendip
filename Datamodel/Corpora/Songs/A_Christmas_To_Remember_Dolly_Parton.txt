you've made this a christmas to remember springtime feelin's in the middle of december strangers meet and they willingly surrender oh what a christmas to remember almost went to aspen but something told me no i considered mammoth but there wasn't enough snow and i even thought of gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go so i headed up to tahoe for a christmas on the slopes and i had fantasized about christmas in this way curled up by a fireplace in a tahoe ski chalet with a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood but even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and you've made this a christmas to remember springtime feelin's in the middle of december change the radio and i'll turn the lights down dimmer oh what a christmas to remember strangers when we met lovers as we leave christmas to remember too good to believe don't know how or when but i know we'll meet again we'll come blowin back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind and you've made this a christmas to remember springtime feelin's in the middle of december neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender oh what a christmas to remember we loved and laughed and played and joked sang christmas songs and talked to folks sleighed the fields and skied the slopes then to the lodge for dinner but now it's time for us to go as our hearts melt like chimney snow there's just one thing i want to know can we do this next winter oh what a christmas to remember you've made this a christmas to remember springtime feelin's in the middle of december though the fire is hot we'll just have to let it simmer oh what a christmas to remember you've made this a christmas to remember springtime feelin's in the middle of december though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers oh what a christmas to remember
