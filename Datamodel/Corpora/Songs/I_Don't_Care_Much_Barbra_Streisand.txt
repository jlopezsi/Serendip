i don't care much go or stay i don't care very much either way hearts grow hard on a windy street lips grow cold with the rent to meet me so if you kiss me if we touch warning's fair i don't care very much i don't care much go or stay i don't care very much either way words sound false when your coat's too thin feet don't waltz when the roof caves in so if you kiss me if we touch warning's fair i don't care very much
