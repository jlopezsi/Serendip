i saw you looking in the mirror i saw you fighting with your conscious i think you need a little time away and i may give you mine and you could find me in the moon glow you find me underneath your pillow and we can find a little hideaway where we can go i'm in the corner with a friend of mine i stood with my defenses down so many things that bring you close to me that we be led astray the wonder of desire to love the things we cannot touch maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away and then the story can go on without a single tear you take a chance on it and change the history and for a time we fall in love with someone so who am i to say the words that say we have found each other can we imagine any hideaway is right and our adventure down in paradise borne upon the wind and we are one with the night maybe we shuffle off to rio a little rio de janeiro and then i get a little chance to say i'm falling into you one and you and i can change the world if we just try hideaway this lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light in your world to make the sense of it and solve the mystery in my arms it's just the love you forever leave with someone one so who am i to say the words that say we've found each other sunny day can we imagine any hideaway is right in your world and our adventure down in paradise in my arms born upon the wind and we are one with the night and our adventure down in paradise borne upon the wind and we are one with the night
