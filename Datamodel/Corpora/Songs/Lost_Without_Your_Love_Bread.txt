lost and all alone i always thought that i could make it on my own but since you left i hardly make it through the day my tears get in the way and i need you back to stay i wander through the night and search the world to find the words to make it right all i want is just the way it used to be with you here close to me and i've got to make you see that i'm lost without your love life without you isn't worth the trouble of and i'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel a touch without a feel i can't believe its real and someday soon i'll wake and find my heart won't have to break yes i'm lost without your love life without you isn't worth the trouble of all i want is the way it used to be i need you here with me oh darling can't you see if we had love before we can have it back once more
