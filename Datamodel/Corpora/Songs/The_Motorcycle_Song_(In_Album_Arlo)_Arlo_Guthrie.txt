words and music by arlo guthrie chorus i don't want a pickle just want to ride on my motorsickle and i don't want a tickle cause i'd rather ride on my motorsickle and i don't want to die just want to ride on my motorcy cle it was late last night the other day i thought i'd go up and see ray so l went up and i saw ray there was only one thing ray could say was chorus this song is about the time that i was ridin my motorcycle going down a mountain road at 150 miles an hour playin my guitar on one side of the mountain road there was a mountain and on the other side there was nothin there was a cliff in the air now when you're going down a mountain road at i50 miles an hour you gotta be very careful especially if you're playin a guitar especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar because if it's an acoustic guitar the wind pressure is greater on the box side than on the neck side because there's more guitar on the box side i wasn't payin attention luckily i didn't go into the mountain i went over the cliff i was goin at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down at the same time i knew it was the end i looked down i said wow some trip i thought it well i knew it was i knew it was my last trip and in my last remaining seconds in world i decided to write one last farewell song to the world put a new ink cartridge in my pen took out a piece of paper i sat back and i thought awhile then i started writin i don't want a pickle just want to ride on my motorsickle and i don't want a tickle cause i'd rather ride on my motorsickle and i don't want to die just want to ride on my motorcy cle i knew that it wasn't the best song l ever wrote but i didn't have time to change it i was comin down mighty fast but as you all know and as fate would have it i didn't die i landed on the top of a police car and he died i drove away on the road that he was on i came into town at a screamin 175 miles an hour playin the motorcycle song i came into town i jumped off my bike the bike went around the corner by itself went up on the stand by itself turned itself off i walked over to my friend he was standin there eatin pickles i said hi what's happenin he looked at me in the eye and said nothin you gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm like you just squashed a cop chorus
