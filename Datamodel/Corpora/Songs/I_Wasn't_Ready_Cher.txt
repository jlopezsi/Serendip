last night i was in heaven today i'm still on a cloud in his arms i was in heaven and i didn't know what it was all about when he walked out the hurt walked in i guess i wasn't ready for love last night i thought i was gain today i feel so ashamed if he only knew i need him again he would come and ease my pain when he walked out the hurt walked in i guess i wasn't ready for love he said that he loved me he told me he'd protect me he told me he needed me but i was to blind to see yeah i was to blind to see last night i was in heaven but it was hell when he walked out the hurt walked in i guess that i wasn't ready for love wasn't ready wasn't ready
