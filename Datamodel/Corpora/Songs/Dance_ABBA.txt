oh my love it makes me sad why did things turn out so bad was it just a dream everything we did everything we had baby give me one more dance while the music still goes on don't think about tomorrow dance and forget our time is gone tonight's a night we borrow let's make it a memory a night of our own a thing to remember when we're all alone so dance it's our way to say goodbye yes all we have to do is dance while the music still goes on this is no time for crying dance don't you hear them play our song god knows that we've been trying but we didn't make it cause nothing's the same we just couldn't help it nobody's to blame so dance while the music still goes on and let it be our last goodbye yet it seems to make me sad why did things turn out so bad was is just a dream everything we did everything we had baby give me one last dance while the music still goes on just like the night i met you dance and believe me when you're gone you know i won't forget you our love was a snowbird it's flying away you tell me it's over what more can i say so dance while the music still goes on it's gonna be our last goodbye dance while the music still goes on don't think about tomorrow dance and forget our time is gone tonight's a night we borrow let's make it a memory a night of our own a thing to remember when we're all alone so dance while the music still goes on and let it be our last goodbye dance while the music still goes on this is no time for crying dance don't you hear them play our song god knows that we've been trying dance while the music still goes on just like the night i met you dance and believe me when you're gone you know i won't forget you fade
