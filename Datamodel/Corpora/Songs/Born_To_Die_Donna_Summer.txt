just a baby on a doorstep it's how they found me cold and hungry raised on hatred fed by strangers as a young girl i often wondered chorus am i born to die never having lived am i born to die without love in my life people push me knock me down my foster parents kicked me around they brought me up on loneliness i never had me a single friend chorus must be someone in this world who can save me from myself or am i born to die never having lived am i born to die without love in my life chorus
