they were sitting they were talking in the strawberry swing every moment was so precious they were sitting they were talking in the strawberry swing everybody was for fighting wouldn't wanna waste a thing cold cold water bring me round now my feet won't touch the ground cold cold water what ya say it's such it's such a perfect day it's such a perfect day i remember we were walking up to strawberry swing i can't wait til the morning wouldn't wanna change a thing people moving all the time inside a perfectly straight line don't you wanna curve away it's such it's such a perfect day it's such a perfect day now the sky could be blue i don't mind without you it's a waste of time could be blue i don't mind without you it's a waste of time could be blue could be grey without you i'm just miles away could be blue i don't mind without you it's a waste of time
