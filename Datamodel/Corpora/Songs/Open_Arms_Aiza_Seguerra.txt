intro lying beside you here in the dark feeling your heart beat with mind softly you whisper you're so sincere how could our live be so blind we sailed on together we drifted apart and here you are by my side chorus so now i come to you with open arms nothing to hide believe what i say so here i am with open arms hoping you'll see what your love means to me open arms ii living without you living alone this empty house seems so cold wanting to hold you wanting you near how much i wanted you home but now that you've come back turned night into day i need you to stay repeat chorus
