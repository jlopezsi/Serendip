time and again i've longed for adventure something tn make my heart beat the faster what did i long for i never really knew finding your love i found my adventure touching your hand my heart beats the faster all that i want in all of this world is you are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long you are the breathless hush of evening that trembles on the brink of a lovely song you are the angel glow that lights a star the dearest things i've known are what you are someday my happy arms will hold and someday i'll know that moment divine when all the things you are are mine dah-dah-dah someday my happy arms will hold and someday i'll know that moment divine when all the things you are are mine too-too-mm-dah-dah-dah
