words and music by james rider just me and a friend roamin around him a magician and i was a clown playin the streets for a dollar a day waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way crossed over the border to a mystical land sort of unexpected didn't quite understand on a razor's edge on a grain of sand onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion on a roll of the dice we headed out west where the sage and and the spice attracted us shadows fell down like a dark groping hand saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs on a turn of the cards i lightened my load throwing off fear for the weakness it holds on target and calm the vision was clear beyond the mirage i took for granted was here on a flip of the coins we rode the coast tryin to make the most of every situation that we witnessed near at hand on a drifter's crusade all over the land could it be in the stars in the passing of cars at a table in the bar in a turn of the cards in a change of your mind in the passing of time in a ribbon of rhyme just down the line just me and a friend roamin around him a magician i was a clown playin the streets for a dollar a day waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way
