why do you laugh at me when you know i really care you sometimes act as though i'm not even there and yet if you did to me the things i do to you i would surely say we're through chorus don't you know that i love you i was hoping you'd love me too don't you know that i love you love you if i seem to you indifferent once or twice it's because i was feelin quite that way and the time i hung up the phone and didn't speak again well it's funny to look back then didn't i love you love you didn't i love you all the time didn't you need me need me wasn't it a long hard climb chorus
