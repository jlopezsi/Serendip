i'll never be the same guys have lost their meaning for me i'll never be the same nothing's what it once used to be and when the song birds that sing tell me it's spring i can't believe their song once love was king but kings can be wrong i'll never be the same there is such an ache in my heart i'll never be the same since we're apart but there's a lot that a smile can hide and i know deep down inside i'll never be the same never be the same again
