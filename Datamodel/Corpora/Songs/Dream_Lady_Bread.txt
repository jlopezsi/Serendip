i see her walking in the velvet moonlight but then she hides behind the clock of midnight and as i look to see her face she disappears without a trace sometimes i find myself in endless wandering when i awaken in the misty morning and i must look to find my way as i await the end of day dream lady dream lady and i await the end of day til nighttime comes again to stay dream lady dream lady dream lady
