apples don't fall far from the tree writer bob stone when i was five i put on mama's high heel shoes and paint my face and dance across the living room in ruby's place well the music was always playing girls laugh while the men were sayin chorus apples don't fall far from the tree hey honey come sit on my knee apples don't fall far from the tree and i remember mama's tears when they said in a few years i'd be something to see at seventeen i had me a diamond and a string of pearls the men said they preffered me to the other girls they took me to the best places but i could read it on their faces chorus then when mama died i made up my mind to get on a greyhound get out of this town and leave it all behind but life goes on a child of three smiles up at me while she plays the man i love has never heard of ruby's place when he holds her with affection and he uses that old expression chorus
