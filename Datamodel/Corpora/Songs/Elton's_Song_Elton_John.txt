staring all alone and your grace and style cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile i watched you playing pool it's all around the school that i love you i love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes always unprepared for your pointed replies cynical and lean i lie awake and dream about you if you only knew what i'm going through time and again i get ashamed to say your name it's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there my lips are dry i catch your eye and look away sitting in my room i've got it bad crying for the moon they think i'm mad they say it isn't real but i know what i feel and i love you but i would give my life for a single night beside you
