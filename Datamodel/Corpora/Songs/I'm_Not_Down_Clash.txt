if it's true that a rich man leads a sad life n that's what they from day to day then what do all the poor do with their lives have nothing to say on judgment day i've been beat up i've been thrown out but i'm not down i'm not down i've been shown up but i've grown up and i'm not down i'm not down on my own i faced a gang of jeering in strange streets when my nerves were pumping and i fought my fear in i did not run i was not done and i have lived that kind of day when one of your sorrows will go away it goes down and down and hit the floor down and down and down some more depression but i now there'll be some way when i can swing everything back my way like skyscrapers rising up floor by floor i'm not giving up so you rock around and think that you're the toughest in the world the whole wide world but you're streets away from where it gets the roughest you ain't been there
