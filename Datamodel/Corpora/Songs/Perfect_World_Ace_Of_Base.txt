they say the time has come for us to start again i believe that's true they say the time has come for us to make amends and i believe that too why tell me why is it all so hard to find i pray each day for a perfect world where children are laughing lovers romancing time stands still a perfect world there's nothing to cry for no one to die for wonderful in a perfect world our father's father says that things were better then how easy they forgot on every page in every book of history a thousand tears were shed there's hope in our hearts and love in our eyes day after day i keep searching why tell me why is it all so hard to find i pray each day for a perfect world show me the way i'm to understand that you prove to myself that i'm a man and you love but you can't look from above travel cross the seven seas to be with you passion and desire will see me through the road that i must travel will wind and curl you're all i ever needed in a perfect world
