i have dreams for you and me and wishes that will last and live beyond eternity summer's gone winter's on can we weather everything our eyes have yet to see as the years go by i promise you that i i will be the one to run to when the nights are long i'll be there when winds begin to blow even when it seems that everything is going wrong this i swear i swear i won't be the one to let go life gets tough ooh roads get rough ooh who knows what awaits us round the bend count on me faithfully though everything we have could never end it could never end and through rain or shine and every cloudy sky i will be the one to run to when the nights are long i'll be there when winds begin to blow even when it seems that everything is going wrong this i swear this i swear i won't be the one to let go i'll be there i'll be there anytime you need me you'll know where i am you'll know just where i am and everywhere everywhere anytime you're lost just turn around just turn around and take my hand and i will be your light in the night and i promise that even when it seems that everything is going wrong this i swear this i swear i won't be the one to let go to let go this i swear i swear i won't be the one to let go to let go
