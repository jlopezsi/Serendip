it's alright to cry even my dad does sometimes so don't wipe your eyes tears remind you you're alive it's alright to die cause death the only thing you haven't tried but just for tonight hold on so live life like you're giving all cause you act like you are go ahead and just live it up go on and tell me your path it's alright to shake even my hand does sometimes so inside the rage against the dying of the light it's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried but just for today hold on so live life like you're giving all cause you act like you are go ahead and just live it up go on and tell me your path go ahead and just live it up go on and tell me your path and hold on
