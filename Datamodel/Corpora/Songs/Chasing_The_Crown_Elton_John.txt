i built a wall in china i sank an ocean liner i've wrecked homes i've burned thrones chasing the crown i've put thorns in your feet i spread plague in the streets i've sprung traps confused maps chasing the crown i'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple i was licking my lips till his son come down i'm chasing the crown the crown i'm chasing the crown i'm taking a turn in the right direction by leaving his soul in the lost and found i'm chasing the crown i'm chasing the crown i saw the tea float in boston i saw the live wire shock them i made them float i made them drown chasing the crown i laid the desert sands i froze the polar caps well they'd dry out and i'd shout hey i'm chasing the crown
