chorus mama when my dollies have babies and i am a big lady mama will a prince come and take me away when i said these things i believed in kings then i didn't know love could hurt me so slowly she replied tears had filled her eyes baby not so fast let your young life last chorus i sang to her in fun my teens had just began my age was not the same still we played the game her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride chorus mama will the hurt go away deep inside when i sang this song my poor world had gone along all my early dreams has turned to crystal streams my love it was last and more tears have past and left me just one thing a tender voice i sing chorus
