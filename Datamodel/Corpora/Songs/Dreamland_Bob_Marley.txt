there's a land that i have heard about so far across the sea repeat to have you all my dreamland would be like heaven to me repeat we'll get our breakfast from the tree we'll get our honey from the bees we'll take a ride on the waterfalls and all the glories we'll have them all and we'll live together on that dreamland and have so much fun repeat oh what a time that will be oh yes we'll wait wait wait and see we'll count the stars up in the sky and surely we'll never die
