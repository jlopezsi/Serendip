how many times have you heard someone say if i had his money i'd do things my way hmm but little they know hmm it's so hard to find one man in ten with a satisfied mind hmm once i was wading in fortune and fame everything that i dreamed of to get a start in lifes game but suddenly it happened hmm i lost every dime but i'm richer by far with a satisfied mind hmm when my life is over and my time has run out my friends and my loved ones i'll leave there ain't no doubt but one things for certain when it comes my time i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
