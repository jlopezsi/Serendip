you saw me crying in the chapel the tears i shed were tears of joy i know the meaning of contentment now i am happy with the lord just a plain and simple chapel where humble people go to pray i pray the lord that i'll grow stronger as i live from day to day i've searched and i've searched but i couldn't find no way on earth to gain peace of mind now i'm happy in the chapel where people are of one accord we gather in the chapel just to sing and praise the lord ev'ry sinner looks for something that will put his heart at ease there is only one true answer he must get down on his knees meet your neighbor in the chapel join with him in tears of joy you'll know the meaning of contentment then you'll be happy with the lord you'll search and you'll search but you'll never find no way on earth to gain peace of mind take your troubles to the chapel get down on your knees and pray your burdens will be lighter and you'll surely find the way
