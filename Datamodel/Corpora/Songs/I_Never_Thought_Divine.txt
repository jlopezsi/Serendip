standing with your boys on the corner i see them look at me walking by but they don't understand how i'm feeling cause boy you are the apple of my eye 1 i never thought no never that i'd find someone to love me like you do i never thought in a million years that you would make every one of my dreams come true baby there ain't no need for you to worry cause you can turn your back on me you know that i'll still be waitin right under the sycamore tree 2 you're all i see you're all i see i won't let nobody ever come between you and me see you're all i see every time they step to me i don't pay them any mind it's all about you and me repeat 1 repeat 2 as clear as the sea blow around tropical breeze i see only we seven seas seven stars cooling at the park down in nassau just think you and me love say it's all move your lips slow come close to my ear it's here my dear where your fears come clear there's little time left to escape and make best all i see is three to complete making sweet sugar honey all i see all we need the true life is when we can just be i never thought in a million years that you would make every one of my dreams come true repeat 1 until fade
