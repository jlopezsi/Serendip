down in the depths by cole porter with a million neon rainbows burning below me and a million blazing taxis raising a roar here i sit above the town in my pet-paillated gown down in the depths of the ninetieth floor while the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet and the bars are packed with couples calling for more i'm deserted and depressed in my regal-eagle nest down in the depths of the ninetieth floor when the only one you wanted wants another what's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore why even the janitor's wife has a perfectly good love life and here i am facing tomorrow alone in my sorrow down in the depths of the ninetieth floor
