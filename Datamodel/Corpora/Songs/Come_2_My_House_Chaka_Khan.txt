i've got this feelin inside and it won't go away it'll take time for it to subside and oh by the way come 2 my house where we can play like i'm your flower we'll hide and seek then we will find love's highest power could you stop by for some really good beer or a glass of wine there's no threat there's no danger here if you fore go go the time a look in your eyes and you remind me of my daddy i can't say why i decided tonight yes you can have me love will surrender oh when the heart cries out don't leave me standin here not here not now
