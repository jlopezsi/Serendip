i've been waiting for so long i've been hoping your love's not gone houses are sliding in the mud rivers are raging in your blood where would i be without your love where would i be without your arms around me you were to be the only one if i knew you i would not run you have been cloudy distant and dark i'm thinking of noah and the ark where would i be without your love where would i be without your arms around me
