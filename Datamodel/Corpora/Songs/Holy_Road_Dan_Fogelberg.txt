last night i dreamed i was looking down on the planet earth spinning round and round and as i cast my gaze about i watched her lovely light go out the light went out and floating in the black of space i was looking into god's own face and in his hand he held this tiny earth he said well ain't it a shame what they've done to her after i'd shown them to the holy road the holy road after i'd shown them to the holy road the holy road well i laid a bounty in their hands and only gave them ten commands but they never learned their lessons very well and they drove my garden straight to hell that's when they fell off of the holy road the holy road that's when they fell off of the holy road the holy road let me tell you well the popes were frauds and the kings were fools and your presidents only dupes and tools and the money makers and the chiefs of staff who worshipped of that golden calf they turned their backs upon the holy road the holy road they turned their backs upon the holy road the holy road and then i told him well you made the sun and you made the sky the things that crawl and the things that fly and then you made the human race and he said well everybody makes mistakes i thought they'd want to walk the holy road the holy road i thought they'd want to walk the holy road the holy road and even though it was just a dream it seemed as real as it could seem and often dreams the truth forebodes you got to get back children on the holy road get back children on the holy road get back children on the holy road get back children on the holy road holy road the holy road gotta get back on the holy road the holy road gotta get back on the holy road the holy road gotta get back on the holy road the holy road on the holy road on the holy road on the holy road people on the holy road on the holy road now the holy road on the holy road children on the holy road
