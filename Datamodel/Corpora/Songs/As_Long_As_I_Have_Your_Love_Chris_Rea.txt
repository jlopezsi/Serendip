the word you send today from somewhere far away cut in deep to the bone though i am not with you now i feel you close somehow too many days so far from home and i send my dream to you and i will go on as long as i have your love i see your candle burn you wait for my return i feel your shadow in the night the question still remains oh love its still the same oh i'll get by don't you know i'll be alright as long as i have your love
