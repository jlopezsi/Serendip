bang bang you shot me down bang bang i hit the ground bang bang that awful sound bang bang my baby shot me down i was five and you were six we rode on horses made of sticks i wore black you wore white you would always win the fight bang bang you shot me down bang bang i hit the ground bang bang that awful sound bang bang my baby shot me down seasons came and changed the time i grew up i called you mine you would always laugh and say remember when we used to play bang bang you shot me down bang bang i hit the ground bang bang that awful sound bang bang my baby shot me down music played and people sang just for me the church bells rang after echoes from a gun we both vowed that we'd be one now you're gone i don't know why sometimes i cry you didn't say goodbye you didn't take the time to lie bang bang you shot me down bang bang i hit the ground bang bang that awful sound bang bang my baby shot me down
