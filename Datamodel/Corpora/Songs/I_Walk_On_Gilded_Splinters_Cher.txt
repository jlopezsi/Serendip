some people think they jive me but i know they must be crazy they can't see their misfortune or else they're just too lazy je suie le grand zombie with my yellow chaffen of choisen ain't afraid of no tomcat and gonna fill my guts with poison i walk through the fire and i'll fly through the smoke i want to see my enemies on the end of my rope walk on pins and neeedles and i see what they can do walk on guilded splinters with the king of the zulu chorus come to me get it come come walk on guilded splinters come to me get it come come walk on guilded splinters till i burn up till i burn up till i burn up till i burn up when i roll out in my coffin drink poison in my chalice pride begins to fade and you all feel my malice i put gris-gris on your doorstep so soon you be in the gutter i'll make your heart melt like butter i say i can make you stutter chorus x3
