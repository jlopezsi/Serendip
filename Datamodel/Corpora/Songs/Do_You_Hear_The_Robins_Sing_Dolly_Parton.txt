where you live you say the view is so beautiful and the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around and the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven but do you ever ever hear the robins sing do you hear the robins singing in the springtime while a mockingbird sings his happy song is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing do you ever ever hear the robins sing ac.guitar where i live the butterflies still kiss the roses and forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane and the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze and often i still hear the robins sing do you hear the robins do you ever ever hear the robins sing
