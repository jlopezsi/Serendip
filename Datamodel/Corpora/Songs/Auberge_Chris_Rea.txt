on the hard fast train on the road to gain something gets right through to your telling bone there's a sudden itch an electric twitch sometimes i swear this body's got a mind of its own this is the naked truth this is the light there's only one place left to go auberge you meet a silent type on a windy trail with a shiny cloak and an unseen silver dagger you can talk till you ache give yourself one more break you can tell by the look on his face that it just doesn't matter this is the naked truth this is the light there's only one place left to go auberge give me a weekend give me a day don't like what i'm seeing though i hear what you say think with a dagger and you'll die on your knees begging for mercy singing please mister please this is the naked truth this is the light there's only one place left to go auberge
