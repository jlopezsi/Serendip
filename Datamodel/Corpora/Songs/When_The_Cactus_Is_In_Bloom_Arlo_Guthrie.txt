words and music by jimmy rodgers cattle prowl and the coyotes howl out on the great divide never done no wrong just singin a song as down the trail i ride rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs you can hear that mournful tune cause it's round-up time a-way out west when the cactus is in bloom yodel chorus daylight comes and the cowhands yell they call out every man throw my saddle on my old cow horse i drink my coffee from a can the sun goes down on the cattle trail and i'm gazin at the moon cause it's round-up time a-way out west when the cactus is in bloom yodel now we don't have cold weather it never snows or rains this is where the sun shines best out on the western plains some of the boys are gone away but they will be back soon cause it's round-up time a-way out west when the cactus is in bloom yodel chorus
