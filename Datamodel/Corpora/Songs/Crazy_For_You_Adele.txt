found myself today singing out your name you said i'm crazy if i am i'm crazy for you sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here turns me crazy but it's you who makes me lose my head and every time i'm meant to be acting sensible you drift into my head and turn me into a crumbling fool tell me to run and i'll race if you want me to stop i'll freeze and if you want me gone i'll leave just hold me closer baby and make me crazy for you crazy for you lately with this state i'm in i can't help myself but spin i wish you'd come over send me spinning closer to you my oh my how my blood boils it's sweet taste for you strips me down bare and gets me into my favorite mood i keep on trying fighting these feelings away but the more i do the crazier i turn into pacing floors and opening doors hoping you'll walk through and save me boy because i'm too crazy for you crazy for you
