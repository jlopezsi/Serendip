i listen to my heartbeat and i try to follow where it leads me that's right i don't wake up in the shadows anymore i can finally breathe i dig a little deep down searching took a little time to work it through but i found everything the day that i had you i once was the lost one like a wayward child now you're the light that leads the way i can melt the drops of freezing rain i'll fly in and save the day i will always try to make it better than it was for me you'll always be the first one in my prayers just close your eyes and i am there it's a better world since you're my boy i'll always be your girl i'm picking up all the pieces when i put em back together i'm like new cause my greatest wish has already come true we'll always be connected baby like a button to a sleeve and this lullaby will send you off to sleep it's hard to imagine my life before you cause you're the light that leads the way i can melt the drops of freezing rain i'll fly in and save the day i will always try to make it better than it was for me you'll always be the first one in my prayers just close your eyes and i am there it's a better world since you're my boy i'll always be your girl i'll be holding the wrap if you come on and fall there is love after love after all we'll always be connected baby you're like a button on my sleeve and this lullaby oh i can melt the drops of freezing rain i'll fly in and save the day i will always try to make it better than it was for me you'll always be the first one in my prayers just close your eyes and i am there it's a better world since you're my boy i'll always be your girl your girl
