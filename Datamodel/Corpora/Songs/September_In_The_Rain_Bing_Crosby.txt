the leaves of brown came tumblin down remember in september in the rain the sun went out just like a dying ember that september in the rain to every word of love i heard you whisper the raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain though spring is here to me it's still september that september in the rain to every word of love i heard you whisper the raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain though spring is here to me it's still september that september in the rain that september in the rain
