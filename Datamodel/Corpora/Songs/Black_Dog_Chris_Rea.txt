black dog barking in the cold grey light he pulls the chain and he pulls it tight this ain't no lonesome wail that boy ain't faking he bites the steel and he claws the ground he pulls again and he spins around his eyes are raging and his burning lungs are steaming he want to walk in the sun feel love like anyone no one knows that black dog better than i i said no one knows that black dog better than i when i see his running i can see me teeth in the collar and he's tearing it free spit out the leather and the cold studs that kept you from singing run till you're bleeding run till you're hot till the memory of all this you've long since forgot run till forever till the bells of your freedom are ringing he want to walk in the sun feel love like anyone no one knows that black dog better than i i said no one knows that black dog better than i
