i know i've just gotta get out of this place i can't stand any more of that mechanical grace though you say it's only industrial squeeze it looks like luxury and feels like a disease chorus oh give it to me give it to me i don't want to know much about much give it to me give it to me i need i need i need the human touch left with just a house to hold drinking your way to drydock it's easy to break up a model citizen living in the state of shock i just can't believe i am responsible for this what the makeup hides can't be hidden with a kiss when i'm talking in tongues i go where you lead i don't make you plead oh i need you how i'd like to fix her in a picture of rage how i'd like to catch her when she's acting her age but when she's laying stretched out on the floor it's no mystery to me anymore chorus
