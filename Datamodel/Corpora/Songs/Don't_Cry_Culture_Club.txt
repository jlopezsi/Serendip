you say that you're misunderstood but you like it that way then you say you're lonely well that's the price you pay and i don't think i love you that's the cruelest game we play but i love you that way you're a perfect lover why don't you stay you're a perfect lover ain't it always that way you feel a little twisted you feel a little pain you're a little hateful don't worry you'll feel that way again cry don't cry don't cry for me you say that you're not beautiful but you are in my eyes you say my love's too heavy well that comes as no surprise it's already over there's nothing to say it's already over but you need to love to show you your way
