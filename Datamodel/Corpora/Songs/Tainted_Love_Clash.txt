sometimes i feel i've got to run away i've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me the love we share seems to go nowhere and i've lost my light for i toss and turn i can't sleep at night once i ran to you i ran now i'll run from you this tainted love you've given i give you all a boy could give you take my tears and that's not nearly all oh tainted love tainted love now i know i've got to run away i've got to get away you don't really want anymore from me to make things right you need someone to hold you tight and you think love is to pray but i'm sorry i don't pray that way once i ran to you i ran now i'll run from you this tainted love you've given i give you all a boy could give you take my tears and that's not nearly all oh tainted love tainted love don't touch me please i cannot stand the way you tease i love you though you hurt me so now i'm gonna pack my things and go tainted love tainted love x2 touch me baby tainted love x2 tainted love x3
