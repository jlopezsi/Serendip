i pump poison into my body to forget that i am me feels good wonderful i forget i have feelings at all you're dizzy i floated up fifteen miles high stuck my head through all the holes in our sky i looked out across the universe and thought of you you're dizzy and i am dizzy too i became lunatic with rolling eyes squirming on the ground frozen in ice called to my mother said mother please feed me before the sky falls in on me you're dizzy
