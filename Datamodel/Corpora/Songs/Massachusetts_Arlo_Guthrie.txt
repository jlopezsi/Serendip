like a dream in the night as the snow settles white there's a fire burning bright in massachusetts and there's a house upon a hill that keeps us from the chill and by the grace of god we will be in massachusetts you can tell me about the times you spent in the rockies and on the plains please don't think that i'm the last to say that there ain't lots of other places in this world that still remain beautiful and unchanged but they're just not the same the sun comes up to meet the dawn and there's a day that must go on there's another night that's gone in massachusetts and i could spend all of my days and remain each day amazed at the way each day is phrased in massachusetts you can tell me about the times you spent in the rockies and on the plains please don't think that i'm the last to say that there ain't lots of other places in this world that still remain beautiful and unchanged but they're just not the same now if you could only see i know you would agree there ain't nowhere else to be like massachusetts and there's a house upon a hill that keeps us from the chill and by the grace of god we will be in massachusetts come on tell me about the time you spent in the rockies and on the plains and please don't think that i'm the last to say that there ain't lots of other places in this world that still remain beautiful and unchanged but they're just not the same as massachusetts
