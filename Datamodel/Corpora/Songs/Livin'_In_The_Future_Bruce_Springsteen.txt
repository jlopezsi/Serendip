a letter come blowin in on an ill wind somethin bout me and you never seein one another again and what i knew had come stars struck deaf and dumb like when we kissed that taste of blood on your tongue chorus x 2 don't worry darlin no baby don't you fret we're livin in the future and none of this has happened yet woke up election day sky's gunpowder and shades of grey beneath the dirty sun i whistle my time away then just about sun down you come walkin through town your boot heels clickin like the barrel of a pistol spinnin round chorus the earth it gave away the sea rose towards the sun i opened up my heart to you it got all damaged and undone my ship liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon the grounds keeper opened the gates and let the wild dogs run alone i limp through town a lost cowboy at sundown got my monkey on a leash got my ear tuned to the ground my faith's been torn asunder tell me is that rollin thunder or just the sinkin sound of somethin righteous goin under chorus none of this has happened yet none of this has happened yet none of this has happened yet none of this has happened yet na na na na na na na na-na repeat until fade
