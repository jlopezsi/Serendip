missed the saturday dance heard they crowded the floor couldn't bear it without you don't get around much anymore thought i'd visit the club got as far as the door they'd have asked me about you don't get around much anymore oh darling i guess my mind's more at ease but nevertheless why stir up memories been invited on dates might have gone but what for it's awfully diff'rent without you don't get around much anymore
