i saw you when you came in this morning all chummy with somebody new and i was all alone this morning in sorrrow still loving you i know it shows i'm broken hearted this feelin just won't go away i've been so lonesome since we parted and i'll be blue again in school today lonely school days do i have when you come to school with someone new in my deepest sorrow over losing you lonely school days keep me blue i saw you eating in the lunch room right where we used to sit and dine with someone snugged up close beside you enjoying pleasures that were mine you talk to them along the hallways you walk with them to classes too you leave and go with them of evenings and i go home alone and blue
