i will be walking one day down a street far away and see a face in the crowd and smile knowing how you made me laugh hearing sweet echoes of you from the past i will remember you look in my eyes while you're near tell me what's happening here see that i don't want to say good-bye our love is frozen in time i'll be your champion and you will be mine i will remember i will remember you later on when this fire is an ember later on when the night's not so tender given time though it's hard to remember darlin i will be holding i'll still be holding to you so many years come and gone and yet the memory is strong one word we never could learn good-bye true love is frozen in time i'll be your champion and you'll be mine i will remember you so please remember i will remember you i will remember you i will remember you i will remember you
