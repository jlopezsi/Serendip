lie alone in bed at night feel the pull of a lonely day thoughts like music start to play i wonder where you were today baby blue baby baby blue baby blue eyes i dream of you late at night when the whole world's sleeping i dream of you close to you i feel your sweet heart beating i dream of you late at night late at night honey late at night i dream of you i dream of you baby baby blue baby blue eyes i love you new i hold you in my dreams tonight hold you til morning light baby baby baby blue baby blue baby blue eyes i dream of you baby baby baby blue baby blue baby blue eye i dream of you baby baby baby blue
