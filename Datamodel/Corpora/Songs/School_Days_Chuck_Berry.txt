up in the mornin and out to school the teacher is teachin the golden rule american history and practical math you studyin hard and hopin to pass workin your fingers right down to the bone and the guy behind you won't leave you alone ring ring goes the bell the cook in the lunch room's ready to sell you're lucky if you can find a seat you're fortunate if you have time to eat back in the classroom open your books keep up the teacher don't know how mean she looks soon as three o'clock rolls around you finally lay your burden down close up your books get out of your seat down the halls and into the street up to the corner and round the bend right to the juke joint you go in drop the coin right into the slot you're gotta hear somethin that's really hot with the one you love you're makin romance all day long you been wantin to dance feeling the music from head to toe round and round and round we go hail hail rock and roll deliver me from the days of old long live rock and roll the beat of the drums loud and bold rock rock rock and roll the feelin is there body and soul
