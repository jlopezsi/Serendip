i know the sound of each rock and stone and i embrace what others fear you are not to roam in this forgotten place just the likes of me are welcome here everything breathes and i know each breath for me it means life for others it's death it's perfectly in balance perfectly planned more than enough for this man like every tree stands on it's own reaching for the sky i stand alone i share my world with no one else all by myself i stand alone i seen your world with these very eyes don't come any closer don't even try i've felt all the pain and heard all the lies but in my world there's no compromise like every tree stands on it's own reaching for the sky i stand alone i share my world with no one else all by myself i stand alone all by myself i stand alone all by myself i stand alone
