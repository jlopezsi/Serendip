in the morning when you wake up to a brand new day with a feeling everything is gonna go your day and you open up the window and the air is just seeting with life what a day when the sun is shinning through it's shinning for you what a day when the birds are singing too they're singing for you what a day oh oh what a day oh oh what a day oh oh what a day having breakfast in a garden full of blooming trees it's so quiet you can hear the sound of falling leaves though you close your eyes for a moment light is all that you see what a day you've been searching you've been climbing never give up just to realise you've been standing on the mountain top cause the future's gone tomorrow but your life is right here today what a day the future's gone tomorrow life is here today things gonna go your way this is yor day the future's gone tomorrow life is here today x2
