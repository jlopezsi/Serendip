it wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry he packed his things walked out the door and drove away and she became the girl from yesterday he took a plane across the sea to some foreign land she stayed at home and tried so hard to understand how someone who had been so close could be so far away and she became the girl from yesterday she doesn't know what's right she doesn't know what's wrong she only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long and she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday the light's on in the window she's waiting by the phone talking to a memory that's never coming home she dreams of his returning and the things that he might say but she'll always be the girl from yesterday yeah she'll always be the girl from yesterday
