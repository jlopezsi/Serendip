judy i feel weary now older than a man of thirty-three the gates of hell just opened after twenty years the warden says i'm free revenge was all i wanted when i killed the man that took your life that day i've had my satisfaction but the price was more than love should have to pay lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame and the way you teased the menfolk the jury all agreed you knew no shame knew no shame well i'm glad that you can't see me now you'd probably say that i do not look my best those lawyers took my money that louisiana road gang took the rest and judy i can't even conjure up your picture in my mind today lately i've been thinkin what a fool i was to love you anyway lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame and the way you teased the menfolk the jury all agreed you knew no shame well it all seems kinda useless as i place these flowers on your grave today i don't know what i'm doin here i've forgotten all the things i came to say
