oh my love has no beginning and my love it has no end always plus and always minus it never breaks it never bends you can shape it any way you want you can turn it left or right cause my love it comes in circles and it comes in black and white and the circle remains unbroken and the circle remains unbroken bridge hope my love don't fade away in my soul hope my love don't fade away i don't want it to hope my love don't fade away in my soul hope my love don't fade away chorus circles have ups and downs don't let them turn you round round and round round and round circles circles don't let them bring you down round and round round and round there is ice there's fire always winter always spring cause my love is like a zero it is nothing and everything oh you know it's like the universe no matter how big or small it goes on and on forever it never drops it never falls and forever remains unbroken and forever remains unbroken bridge chorus 2x
