i've been burning and dousing the flames i feel the whiplash of the backlash on my face i melt to sleep at night but i wake to trip the day never for you never for me would i kiss your feet of clay i'm still alive and so should i soak up the wave of compromise am i the victim of youth is this the truth why don't you tell me why don't you tell me there's no conscience in charity or shame the voice deceives me but believe me it's the same i see the black in white and the color in the gray better for me better for you gonna bleach it all away i'm still alive and so should i soak up the wave of compromise am i the victim of youth is this the truth why don't you tell me why don't you tell me left hand gives and the right hand takes away why don't you tell me why don't you tell me i'm still alive and so should i soak up the wave of compromise i see the scars i hear the lies so what's the truth why don't you tell me
