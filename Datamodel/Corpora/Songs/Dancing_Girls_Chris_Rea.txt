it's all become a fantasy she sits and reads about tiffany's i moan all day about the state of the world and the sun beats down her book if full of pastel shades filigree femmes in lusts of jade while all around the bullets flew and the sun beats down oh heavy heart as deep as the endless sea a thought for every fish why don't you let them be your book's so frivol but i'm tired of mine show me some make me laugh and make me sing dancing girls make me laugh and make me sing dancing girls so many years but nothing's changed we curse the fire but we still feed it's flames my cards repeating the same sad song why don't you put them down tonight is young as young as she needs to be there's room for love as much as there needs to be show me a drink show me a smile show me some make me laugh and make me sing dancing girls make me laugh and make me sing dancing girls
