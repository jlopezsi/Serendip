we give we take we bend until we break we touch and feel to hurt or heal and in the end we run so far from who we really are and we starve and thirst we praise and curse and i don't care how near or far i'll find you wherever you are you know i'll find you wherever you go we shout and scream but it's just a silly dream and we hold it inside like its live or die till in the end we learn to wait and we squeeze the hands of fate and we twist and turn we freeze and burn but i don't care how near or far i'll find you wherever you are you know i'll find you wherever you go through the time and space i'll always see your face and if i must count every star how near or far i'll find you wherever you are you know i'll find you wherever you go
