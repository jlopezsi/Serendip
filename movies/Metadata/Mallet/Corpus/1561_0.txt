this movie was great it had good performance and good concept the concept is 2 guys who have locked up in a bomb shelter for twenty years or something reading noir detective books from the forties br br they come out of the bomb shelter in post nuclear world with humphrey bogart attitudes and clothes all you do is imagine bogart in mad max br br sometime you have montage with 80 music that are laughable i don't know if it was intentional but it adds to movie filled with great jokes br br the director has a fan base so do the actors i don't know what is the old up of the dvd
