after 16 minutes anyway not that it detracts from a nice little comedy-mystery but this was an even cheaper affair than usual from rko as they used up a lot of stock rustic mexican background film to lilting music here while the main characters glided or drove about in front tom conway as the falcon looked as handsome and debonair as ever no 9/13 i don't count those last 3 non-rko efforts with john calvert and had to do without the comedy double act of clark and gargan from now on br br investigation of a painting painted by a dead man with an art gallery eerily similar to the one in woman in the window leads to murder and theft the falcon is chased by the cops while he's chasing the baddies all the way into deepest mexico the dead painter's daughter was played chockful of feminine intuition by martha vickers next step for her was the cute big sleep she also uttered my favourite line from all of the falcon films my father lived at this inn while he was alive wonderful stuff nestor paiva played a helpful ambiguous peasant and joseph vitale a rather unhelpful serious dancer some of their best stuff was to come later with paramount the only downer was the climax could've been handled with a little more sensitivity but in these pics time was money br br another excellent and engrossing falcon outing for the cognoscenti serious people shouldn't waste their valuable time
