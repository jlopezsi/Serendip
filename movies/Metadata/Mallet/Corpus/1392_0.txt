joan crawford is a jewel thief trying to break into society in the last of mrs cheyney a 1937 film from mgm also starring william powell robert montgomery nigel bruce frank morgan and jessie ralph it's a remake of a 1929 film which starred norma shearer crawford is a sophisticated and glamorous woman we first meet on board ship as she's maneuvering and flirting her way into the company of a society crowd while doing so she meets lord arthur dilling robert montgomery he and lord kelton morgan pursue her once in london she wangles the one thing that she and her gang of thieves led by william powell as her butler have been waiting for an invitation to lady ebley's country home and a crack at lady ebley's fabulous pearl necklace all doesn't go as planned br br given the star power the film has some interesting moments but for the most part it's played too straight a lighter touch was needed this is perhaps a directorial problem there were several or the fact that joan crawford was better at drama than at comedy and william powell better at comedy than at drama powell does a great job but it isn't much of a role audiences probably left the theater disappointed perhaps part of the reason the film flopped at the box office he doesn't have a lot to play off of and no chemistry with crawford robert montgomery is his usual self in one of those roles that fit him like a glove but the star trio is too somber br br joan crawford looks fabulous and with a strong director who had a concept of the script she would have been fine she didn't have a grasp of playing comedy but she was a hard worker who seemingly took direction well it's a shame mgm spent all that money on what was a first-class production only to have it just lay an egg apparently some of the racier parts of the play version had to be left out due to the code at times the film drags br br several of the comments blamed crawford some the script but i do believe with the right director the last of mrs cheney could have been a lot better
