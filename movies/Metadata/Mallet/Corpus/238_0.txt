i'm pleased that you all like the show i love static shock it is indeed or at least was one of the better toons on tv though every now and then it appears to go a little over-board with the whole racism awareness biz the show was definitely an anchor point for individuals who felt that they were not equally represented in the pool of superheroes that we know of today br br however i must bring forth the fact that static is not a new character he isn't the first african american superhero either in fact his character was taken from an earlier dc character named black steel br br also fyi green lantern cyborg bumblebee herald and hotspot are all african american in addition to static br br but i agree with all of you bring static back induct him into the justice league as a matter of fact bring back the justice league
