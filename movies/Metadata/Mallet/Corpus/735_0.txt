i could tear this piece of crap apart frame by frame but it's not worth the effort to do so mst3k hasn't touched this only because there's not much to work with br br it has no entertainment value at all i pity the people who made this movie because it has got to reflect some part of their bland disconnected below-average life experiences apparently a man named peter spelson is mostly responsible for this crap br br no joy no suspense no horror no pathos no character development no direction plenty of mustaches though this thing is like a 70s porno without the sex
