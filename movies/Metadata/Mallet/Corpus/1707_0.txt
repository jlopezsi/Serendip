mike jitlov sold his soul to devil for this film the agent for the devil in this case was in this case richard kaye(the films producer although this is yet to be confirmed he now cares for his mum in the family home(featured in the film on welfare the hollywood machine chewed this guy up and spat him out(maybe he should of stuck to math language well another talented human gets chucked on the pile while kevin costner roams free to make movies as he pleases its a very very sad world the film its self is a little self congratulatory but jitlov is such an extraordinary talent that this indulgence can be forgiven the love scenes are handle with a tender naivety which was real the kiss shared between mike and paige moore in the film was mike's first ever kiss the special effects were created by hand by jitlov himself and they are unique no cgi here they are not as flashy as say lord of rings rotk but in a different way they are as impressive 300mil vs less than 500,000 its got its weak points but you probably won't see to many films with this much love and devotion poured into them if you haven't seen this wonderful piece of cinematic whimsy then go see it its kinda cheesy 80's but if thats a bad thing for you its definitely worth seeing thru that to see such a unique talent that you may never see again anywhere else on film and to be cheered up despite your self we love ya mike never stop believing love happiness and fine wishes kbj
