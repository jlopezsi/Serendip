werewolf hunter is an elegant gothic horror film that hearkens back to the days of hammer but with the production capabilities of today the film is not an action packed mixture of violence and cgi transformations like many werewolf films of today have degenerated into but an actual leisurely paced film that takes the time to develop its characters at no time during the film is the viewer ever told that yes this is real or no it is not it is up to the viewer to make their own decision the film deals with the true story of manuel blanco romasanta a man arrested in 1851 for the murder of more than 13 people in rural spain he became known as the werewolf of allariz because his defense against these charges was that he could not control his animal urges since he was in fact a werewolf some liberties are taken with the case one character in the film antonio was never actually proved to have existed since he was never found also the ending merely provides a possible explanation since the truth of the matter is unknown to anyone paco plaza has crafted a truly special film that is unfortunately hampered with a dreadful direct to video title but you should get past that and give this one a shot
