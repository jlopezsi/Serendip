i found videos of the six episode series for bbc 4 in 93 gathering dust on local library shelves i watched them and then watched them again i renewed them with the library i've now done this three times and am trying to track down a copy for my own library br br i don't understand how these could have been overlooked they are wonderfully brilliant truly well written with that quirky surreal twist that only dennis potter can create br br i am now on a personal crusade to bring this marvelously entertaining work of art to the attention of anyone who will listen br br how can this have been overlooked in the states i think this may very well be dennis potters best for the small screen br br the uk cast and crew including ewen mcgregor are impeccable do yourself a favour and find a copy to view and you two will be singing songs from the 50's again
