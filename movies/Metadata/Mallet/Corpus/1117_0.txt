just saw this movie and found it very entertaining it was great to see so many talented artist going back to the 60s all say the same thing that the music business is a difficult but a rewarding experience the only thing that bothered me was that steven tyler was a stand out bitter bitch he had the opportunity to point out how lucky he was being dropped in the early 80s and now enjoying a hugely successful career more than 20 years later instead he bitched about downloads and his former manager getting 20 wow sad comments from a guy who owes his sobriety and second career in the music business to that guy having been in the music business it is great to here so many musicians give songwriting credit to an unexplained force i have heard many say that they draw from a nebulous well to create and it was great to here from many brilliant musicians
