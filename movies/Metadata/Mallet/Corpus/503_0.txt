the only way this film can not be awe inspiring is if you watch it on a 10 black and white tv with a 4 watt sound system maybe that's a bit extreme but i watched this on a 70 projection screen and 7.2 pristine and precise surround sound i have seen this film at least 20 times and get the same pleasure from it each time aretha franklin's voice and the musical abilities of almost the entire cast would carry any film but this one doesn't need it the story might not be completely developed euphemism but the russian mobsters and gi joes scenes are gutbustingly funny also for anyone who has ever listened to modern music and wondered where the world was going to dan akroyd's motivational speech is something to behold although i never expected to say this because i'm a non-religious person the gospel choir's rendition of john the revelator sends shivers down your spine i love this film and would recommend it to anyone who likes good music
