okay so people might think i'm crazy for voting this 10 out of 10 the usual response and comment everywhere i look seems to be a negative one but i was sitting here the other night we just moved into a new house i love the new environment and i was ready for the new year i was up late as always and this movie came on tbs i had just watched clueless with alicia in and i thought if i could stay awake long enough i would watch this i love walken and silverstone but had never seen toro in much so i started watching it i thought at first it was funny hilarious and enthralling the way the girl tied herself up and put herself in the trunk and was extorting her dad for money i first thought she really wanted the money then i figured out it didn't matter she wanted attention it was a cry for help then i see sexy del toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there the scene where uncle ray walken saw she framed her fire news article was hilarious and brilliant and the scene at knotty pines where she said you don't have to be drunk to kiss me and he said i'm not drunk absolutely brilliant not too much love scene then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching i loved it whenever he's talking to her dad and he says are you telling me i've only known this girl two days and already i care more about her than you do wonderful and the scene at the end of the movie i totally knew he was in the trunk and they're sitting there in the trunk and he says what a view she says what makes it a view he says you and then dave matthews starts playing crash into me perfect song then he goes to kiss her and he does that come on come on come on come on come on thing and they close the trunk perfect ending okay so i loved the movie i think that's clear but if any person watched this and hated it they need to go back and watch it again without thinking too hard about it you won't hate it then
