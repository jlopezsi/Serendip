my friend picked this gem up for 9.00 and i must say it was definitely only worth that it looks promising at first glance of the case the canadian version is called kinky killers and the woman on the cover is practically in bondage as soon as you pop it in the menu looks horrible the opening credits look like they were done in windows movie maker and they take so long to get over with then there is the ever so needed gratuitous breast shot that pretty much make the movie mind that none of them are nice the story for this film is confusing to say the least one minute people are dying next there having rough intercourse by the time you get to the middle the story goes from weird to just completely out of this world by the time we were nearing the end i said this title is completely irrelevant then once you see the final scene it all makes sense and then everything reaches a point where it's so strange its unexplainable i think this movie is must see for bad horror movie buffs or if you want to see a ton of gratuitous breast shots pick it up
