to be honest this is one of those movies that you can miss it's entertaining not bad acting highly on the marketing though a tough movie needs to have violence sex and lots of situations where the bad guy is a good guy is that true this movie gives you an interesting cast a nice theme but leaves you with a non-content feeling it's ok but there is something about it that makes it quite unnecessary
