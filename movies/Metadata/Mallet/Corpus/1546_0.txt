i loved this movie all the stars were at their peak they looked so glamorous and young and vital in their careers i loved paulette goddard br br in my personal opinion she has been overlooked by so many she was a wonderful beautiful star can't believe in the re-release they put susan hayward ahead of paulette hayward had a very small part paulette was the star of the movie it's not the first time they have put goddard last too bad i think she's terrific she had the ability to do comedy as well as drama and she was a very gorgeous woman that wonderful laugh of hers
