the story started off well enough but after just a bit the fbi's netforce started looking like a bunch of nerds playing in cyber-space trying to bust someone in a vr environment just wouldn't work they told the guy and he just logged off sighs oh well then they went on to imply that the internet was actually controllable and could be shut off by someone attacking hardlines satellites or fiber optic lines as if the users could actually tell what medium was being used for the transmission of their signals shakes his head it could have been better but i couldn't rate it too low after all it did have a very good twist at the end no spoiler here but even that part wasn't played out very well br br i hope to see more like it but with better technical advice/support
