scott bakula quantum leap's sam beckett and kris kristofersson blade pat garett and billy the kid star in this below average tv movie it seems quite a lot of money for a tv movie has been thrown at this but the pace at times is down to a crawl and bakula's character seems to have become head of netforce with a total lack of any computer knowledge it's dated fairly badly but all movies about computers do that look at wargames or tron but it's main problems are down to a flabby script pedestrian direction and lack of tension as for the ending i'm not even going to go there let's just say it ain't great i gave this film a 4/10 as it's not a total lost cause but i cant recommend spending 2+hours watching this when there are better films out there if you want a hacker movie war games mathew broderick or sneakers robert redford river phoenix are better movies in the same sort of area or for a more mtv friendly teen hacker movie then go for hackers angelina jolie tommy lee miller br br 4/10 if there's nothing better on a rainy sunday it might pass the time but thats about all we can only hope the quantum leap movie gets off the ground to save scott bakula
