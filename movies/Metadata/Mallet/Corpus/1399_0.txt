more poo than poe this tiresome horror sees scaredy cat bela lugosi arrive at the home of his old enemy boris karloff with smug honeymooners david manners and julie bishop there's some fun in seeing frankenstein and dracula duff each other up i suppose but other than that there's little to hold the attention nothing much happens and the 70 minute running time seems twice as long lamest of all is the film's dubious morality no one blinks an eye when an otherwise likable lugosi knifes a cat and the ending sees manners and bishop enjoying one of those it's-all-over-now ho-ho epilogues after they've accidentally shot lugosi in the back and made a run for it while everyone else explodes it's all very tiresome
