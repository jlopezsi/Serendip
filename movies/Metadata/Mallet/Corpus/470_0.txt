i saw kinky killers on showtime the other night and i thought the title was totally lame especially given the content i cannot believe this was rated tv-ma it should have been r br br the film and its corn-ball 70s throw-back plot just doesn't live up to its potential the acting is wooden the plot is twisted non-sensical and drawn out to the point of boredom half the cast could have been played by the same person they look that much alike there is so much idiocy going on that you cannot tell who is whom and what they are doing br br and what no one can look up polycarp on the internet i mean how lame is it that the word is such a mystery br br everything about this movie is one clich after another the overworked cop the inattentive spouse the renegade cop the manipulative shrink oh what a waste of time
