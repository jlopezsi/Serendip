during the 1970's the three major networks mostly abc made a slew of made for tv movies many of them were junk some were imitations of hollywood hits at the time and more than a few were excellent films this is one of them br br i'm fortunate to own this movie and watched it just last night i won't recant the plot for you can find that here but i will say this this movie holds up very well as the years have gone by the look and feel of it really captures the isolation and situation the script isn't filled with old 70's clich√©d dialog and is very well paced it's very well shot and very well acted by two solid actors gil melle's synthesizer score while dated fits the film quite well some of the effects are old but there aren't very many and don't detract from the story if you are fortunate to get a look at this old movie you won't be disappointed br br although i see the point of another reviewer who stated this movie's obscurity is part of it's charm abc and the other networks need to dig into their archives and re-master and release some of the good old tv movies to dvd this one a short walk to daylight dying room only many others
