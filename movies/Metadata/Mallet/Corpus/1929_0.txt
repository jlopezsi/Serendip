here is where the jaws franchise takes a downward plunge the story in this one is that dennis quaid plays the now adult son of roy scheider whom played the police chief in the first two films quaid takes a job working at sea world in orlando and begins to strike up a romance with bess armstrong a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park a maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white when the young shark is discovered it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars then the baby dies and momma gets ticked very ticked when momma shows up i have to say that the deaths are done well especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up and we see and hear the carnage from within momma shark's mouth br br the rest of the movie follows quaid armstrong and a few other noteworthy thespians such as lou gosset jr and lea thompson as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak br br this movie was released in the middle of the 3-d revival of 1983 and several scenes are effective the floating arm comes to mind but many are just window dressing the submersibles or just painfully goofy the shark approaches the camera head on but does not swish it's tail back and forth as it swims the shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track br br just forget the earlier two films and just turn your brain on auto-pilot and you'll enjoy this film just fine br br i just have one question to anybody whom may know when i first saw the film in the mid 80's on betamax the title logo of jaws iii was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style and they chomped at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud chomp br br viewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's the swooshing sound is there the chomp sound effect is there but the cool 3-d animated logo is gone it is replaced by a still frame of jaws iii br br that opening gripped me when i was a kid where did it go br br br br br br
