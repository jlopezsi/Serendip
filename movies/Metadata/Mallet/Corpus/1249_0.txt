i thought this was not a very good remake of the book this movie was based on it changed so many things that would have made the story link together more and i was confused at the beginning when hannah's auny eva told her she looked like chaya this didn't make sense till i saw the part were she went back in time and she wasn't with gitl and shmuel,she was with rivka and someone else who i don't know because it confused me i think they could have made it almost exactly like the book and it wouldn't change the length at all maybe only make is about half hour longer but it's not that long to begin with so it wouldn't make a difference within the first 30 minutes they could have shown her with a brother and cut out most of the rest of the family that was at the sader dinner also they could have added what i thought was a key point from the book when her grandpa will is mad when he is watching the news before the dinner the whole part when she first went back in time was completely different the only part that was right was that fayge(leah and shmule were getting married in the book they didn't even get married the nazi's were at the place where they were having the wedding and the nazi's took them when they all arrived in the book she woke up and gitl was making bread shmuel was there and they were talking then gitl helped chaya(hannah get ready for fayge's(leah and shumuel's wedding when she leaves for the wedding she finds a few girls and starts telling them stories of the future when they arrive at the synagog don't know exact spelling there are nazi's waiting there they talk and explain that they are being relocated but chaya(hannah know that they are going to take them to the concentration camps there was never a violent pushing and shoving of the people going into the trucks i thought the movies was acted well but they could have cut out that part when they go get the picture taken and things like that
