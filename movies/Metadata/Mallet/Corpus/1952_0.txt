by far this is the most innovative of the whole series i mean come on sea world terror at sea world you don't get any better than this and i must say the acting the score and the development all written with intellect i do not care what any one says this film is a true piece of work with the same type of opening of a p.o.v shot in the deep blue ocean which was missed in jaws 2 this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning admittingly the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas but not all the very idea of not one but two sharks in sea world as its grand opening takes place is just freaky special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-d glasses however the film is still enjoyable to watch alan parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test and brought to a new level of scary what most call boring is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they being adults must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can different ideas of murder explosions and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed later the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out and all hell breaks loose literally not so much the scares as the shocks are what draws me to this film and every minute is worth while never trust the ocean it is always full of suprises and in all the wrong ways yes the 3rd demension is pure terror and jaws 3-d will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom 9/10
