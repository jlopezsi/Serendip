somewhere in the film entitled birth there is a charming feminine desire to accept the mystic power which promises eternal love a woman has lost her husband and somehow after a ten year period a small boy appears proclaiming he is the reincarnated soul of her deceased husband the premise is palatable and the acting is brought to the point of acceptability with the talents of nicole kidman and lauren becall however during the film one becomes aware that something beyond credulity is being glossed over the age of the two individuals the older woman eventually accepts her late husband's spirit in the form of the young boy and therein lies the problem even if it's accepted that an older woman could in fact love a little boy the fact of the matter is if the roles were reversed and it was an adult man and a ten year old girl in the bathtub women's groups from one side of the country to the other would be screeching at the top of their lungs that this film is nothing short of child molestation so before you praise the overall romance of the film consider what implications are being accepted
