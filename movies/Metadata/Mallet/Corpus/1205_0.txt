if director robert benton thinks this whodunnit is supposed to be an homage to alfred hitchcock he'd better think again it's closer to william castle benton comes nowhere close to the subtle nail-biting tension hitch provided in his heyday where's the inventive camera style the exciting pervasive musical score where's the finesse roy scheider plays a psychiatrist who is drawn to a shady lady who might have murdered one of his own patients br br improbable and tedious to no end it features an ok roy scheider but meryl streep gives the most annoying neurotic unfocused performance of her otherwise luminous career just count how many times she plays brushes away or toys with her hair that's her acting style here more geraldine page than grace kelly the rest of the cast oh who cares br br proceed at your own risk
