have to agree with monumental's rave out of blighty but the consensual 9.3 in view of much more substantial flicks and maybe even some teleseries seems to me effusive this david milch oeuvre merits same certainly for setting and costume and the casting and acting are nonpareil throughout but at heart this too is a fable of unrelenting stance and style and occasionally eyebrow-raising discomfitures of character and/or situation the cussing becomes ho-hum as intended but it's the facile morphings of swearingen and bullock from scary villain to almost-lovable reprobate and stalwart no-nonsense hero to acquiescent second-banana in this view brad dourif's doc is the most consistent and audience-friendly of the lot even if he's almost too worldly and wise it would seem for both period and locale at bottom the series is a direct peel-off from the late great hill street blues template from ensemble characterizations to the true-blue realisms of the respective subjects and themes still none of this takes away from the incredibly maintained mise-en-scene that would do credit to any filmmaker much less mere teleseries wonks what the latter are making monkeys out of the former nowadays oh minor quibbles meseems poor calamity jane has been overworked for comic relief sometimes and i would be curious for the historic citations for the likes of mr wu and his pigpen nice designated pinch hitter though for exotic color the game's underfoot watson br br addendum after turning cartwheels for the likes of season 1 and even extending into season 2 i personally revise my reactions halfway through the season 3 episodes there can be no question about the polished savvy of the creators here indeed their accomplishments seem all that more astonishing but to me the fact of the matter is that by season 3 deadwood had become almost a parody of itself which is to say high camp i can't quite take seriously the evolutions herein including the earp brothers as blackwater types even as seasoned vets like gerald mcraney and brian cox and even gale harold make you sit up and take notice despite your askance all sustaining members of the ensemble cast continue to maintain their individual roles even robin weigard's late-blooming lesbian albeit the writers and directors have a hard time making it convincing someone has posted here the claim that this deadwood is a dead ringer for the historic one coming from a resident there it should matter but skeptic that i remain i have to believe that it can only be half the tale entertaining and theatrical as it is and finally i personally find two racial elements that fail to ring my bell to wit the characterizations of the negro mama and stable owner and more to the point that of wu in that last case the writers did ring in the verity of heng-dai but assembled 150 chinese between cheyenne and deadwood oh well this is a fable no and a damnably satisfying one at that but to me its history"city falls considerably short of that of its fellow stablemate telesries rome which evinces all the strengths and glories and less of the stagings and asides
