i after performing the threepenny opera playing in a german cabaret duo and spending 100 on kw books had to see this film i searched from the sky to the bottom of a very very deep crevace and it was there in the music room on the shelf yoink br br after watching it my love for kurt weill's music was once again rekindled no other composer in the past century has ever been performed and interpreted as much as kw every musician takes a different slant on him the doors pj harvey elvis costello tom waits radiohead the dresden dolls nick cave lou reed and so many more br br this movie is basically a collaboration of heaps of modern musicians taking different slants on his music set in a broken down warehouse if you want a basic idea of what it's like think bertolt brecht verse as a rap september song as a country and western shudder happy end numbers as strange insane interpretive pieces and the alabama song as a strange rock piece brilliant throughout the movie it explains kw's suppression in a fascist society and him being communist his move to america his love life and of course his musical revolution with small narrated interludes interpretively very well done i await the dvd br br in my opinion kurt weill is the greatest thing that has ever happened to musical theatre ever he created revolution and not in a sex pistols kinda way it was intelligent br br a must see for all revolutionists and musicians br br kurt weill shall rise again
