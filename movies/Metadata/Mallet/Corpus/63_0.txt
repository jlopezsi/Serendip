when i first saw this movie i was around 9 or 10 years old this is william castle's first official horror movie there are no monsters in it and no killers at least no graphic killings but for some reason this has always been one of my favorite william castle movies i remember watching it real late at night i think the intro and the end credits were somehow scary to me at the end as the credits are rolling there is a cartoon of a macabre parade walking by i still remember that to this day one of the cartoon characters is carrying his own head i'm 50 years old now and it's funny how a person can remember insignificant stuff like that over the years i sure wish this movie would be released on dvd i would love to see it in crystal clarity like the other william castle movies that have been released on dvd
