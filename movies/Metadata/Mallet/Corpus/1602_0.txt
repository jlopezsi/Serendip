such a wonderful film with davis giving perhaps her best performance on screen no chain smoking or chewing the scenery here she plays her character of julie aka jezebel with a quite reserve showing that still waters do run deep william wyler makes the most of his cast with all delivering except for press wife believable touching performances fay bainter is exceptional here and rightfully took home the oscar for her performance along with davis it's unfortunate that this was not filmed in technicolor i would loved to have seen this in rich saturated color in many ways i find this much more enjoyable than gwtw the old south and it's strange ways never once strikes an odd chord the last scene is very strong and touching with julie pleading to make me clean like you the somber music returns and you hear the cannon fire and you see julie cradling press head as they head toward the leper island no fear in her eyes you have no doubt she'll persevere
