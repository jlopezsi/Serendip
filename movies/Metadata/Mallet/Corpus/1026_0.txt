what is terrific about this film is that it is not a basic blood guts lorenzo llamas story llamas actually does a very effective job as an almost naive nightclub manager in puerto rico who soon finds himself in over his head in a cleverly plotted story filled with unexpected twists and turns i love the photography throughout the film and particularly the wonderful scenes shot in old san juan and the terrific seascapes that the director used as a backdrop brenda strong is an exciting femme fatale and counterpoint to llamas you may remember her as the braless wonder on sienfeld in which she had a recurring role she is certainly more than braless in this film i thought that the supporting cast all fit their roles perfectly particular kudos to christianne gout what a body frank vincent everybody's favorite bad guy from scorsese film fame e.g casino goodfellas and my personal favorite daniel lugo who played a latin columbo-type overall the film exceeded my expectations from both story photography directorial approach and acting afterall hollywood doesn't make b-film thrillers like this anymore
