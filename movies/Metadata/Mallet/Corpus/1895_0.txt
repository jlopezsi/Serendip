a group of college kids travel to the ghost town of hellgate to find out the truth about a young woman who was murdered by a motorcycle gang in the 1950's.there,they are greeted by ghosts and walking dead hellgate is a cheesy horror flick that will satisfy only the most undemanding fans of horror genre.the acting is terrible and the script is cheesy beyond belief.there is a fair amount of blood and gore including a nice decapitation scene,unfortunately the special effects are lame.the only reasons to see this stinker are a fish on steroids and re-animated turtle plus abigail wolcott as a hot zombie girl.4 out of 10.only for fans of truly mindless zombie flicks
