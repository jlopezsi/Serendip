a great absorbing silent film about a boy and girl who meet as adults and are attracted to each other the man teh-en is of a higher station than miss lim played by the beautiful gone way too soon lily yuen you see the sweetness in her eyes and fall in love with her his mom does not approve since she is just a country girl so the love becomes forbidden love to be sure films like this have been done since film began but this is a great one you just want these two to be happy it is tragic but also sweet and so well put together that it is absorbing and eminently watchable if you thought you couldn't watch a silent film much less one with subtitles try this out i saw it on tcm but it is available on dvd really its great
