his name is albert pyun and his movies are crap the ideas for his movies sound cool in a b movie way but they never deliver captain america cyborg mean guns adrenalin brain smasher dangerously close and radioactive dreams have all caused me pain more than any other director i have not seen any ed wood movies but i imagine that they will be similar radioactive dreams is relentlessly annoying if you thought that the word focker was used too many times in meet the parents wait until marlowe repeats we are slick dicks for the tenth time i have always hated the use of period slang and this movie uses 50's 60's 70's and 80's slang in it's horde of cliched characters from four decades notice that movies that used a lot of slang that were made during these decades are now either unintentionally funny or unbelievably inferior there was a hope in me during the movie that michael dudikoff would die a horrible death he is honestly that annoying john stockwell appears to have no spine in both this and dangerously close his voice is whinny no matter what i say you will see it if you want to but i can not imagine an intelligent person that would consider this a good movie
