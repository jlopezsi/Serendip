ring o birthday is a great prequel to the ring series although the director is not nakata it is a good drawback to the previously made movies the movie includes the origin of the mysterious girl that is sadako if you watched the previous ring movies this is a source of all the confusion and questions that are embedded in the movies mentioned unlike the ringu and ring 2 this has a slower pace even though the movie was short it felt long because of the pacing it was not scary as the others compare but this is a different genre you're looking at ring 0 is a good movie with tremendous writing prowess shown the cast was smooth and the directing is not sub-par to the other ring movies which are considered one of its kind in the genre
