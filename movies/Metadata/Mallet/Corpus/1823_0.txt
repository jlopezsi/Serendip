if one is to talk of genres in russian film then the world war ii film is a genre all to itself a good half if not more of russian films deal with what russians term the great patriotic war and yet precious few of them are so profound and universally understood as grigory chukhrai's classic br br it's a simple story about a young soldier alyosha vladimir ivashov who has just 48 hours of furlough since russia is so vast he uses practically all that time to travel home to his mother along the way he finds romance and lives a lifetime in limited time br br the film is exquisitely crafted well-paced and deeply moving in its evocation of the bonds of love and family highly recommended
