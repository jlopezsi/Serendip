i completely disagree with the previous negative review of this film it is one of the better holocaust dramas i've seen as it portrays what a modern american jewish girl goes through as she experiences the holocaust in a vision/hallucination what is better knowing or not knowing what is happening as events unfold certainly there are some liberties taken with the exact nature of this vision and how she experiences actual historical events but i think that had this film looked slick it would have taken away from the raw experiences the film depicts
