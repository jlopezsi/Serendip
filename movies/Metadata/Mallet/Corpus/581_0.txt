i won't post any spoilers for this film but if you're going to watch this unpopular columbo entry anyway i recommend you don't read this or any other review until afterward br br charlie clay robert vaughn runs a ship building business owned by his father-in-law commodore otis swanson john dehner who is not happy with the wastrel's shady dealings nor is he pleased with any of the people closest to him including his alcoholic daughter joanna clay diane baker his elderly nephew swanny swanson fred draper or his lawyer kittering wilfred hyde-white soon the commodore is murdered and charlie clay covers it up by impersonating the commodore taking the corpse out on the man's yawl at night and throwing the body overboard lt columbo peter falk investigates this case with the help of a veteran sergeant bruce kirby and a 29-year-old novice dennis dugan our rumpled redoubtable detective knows clay covered up the crime but his assumption that clay committed the crime may prove premature br br the reason you shouldn't read any reviews is because they invariably call this is a whodunit that makes it a departure from the usual columbo formula in which we always see the murder take place but the word whodunit gives away the surprise an hour into the filmin which we learn along with columbo that who we thought had done it hadn't done it br br actually it's not that much of a surprise columbo fans will know something is up right away since we see the cover-up but not the murder itself we always get to see the murder we lucky brutes this unusual episode has two precedents double shock also withholds important information during the murder scenein order to surprise us later a friend in deed also has one person covering up the murder for someone else br br columbo is one of those rare series that succeeds because of a strict formula not in spite of it even many mystery series leave us craving more variety the only parallel i can make is an odd one chuck jones's road runner series also works because of its formula the closer it hues to it the funnier it is this film should join the post-jones road runner shorts in one grave marked if it ain't broke don't fix it br br everything is wrong with this entry directed by patrick mcgoohan from a script by jackson gillis the pacing is jerky and awkward the performances are bad diane baker a good actress overplays her role as a drunk peter falk is weirdly aggressive and self-satisfied as columbo the characters seem manipulated into acting the way they do instead of behaving like real people lt columbo has all the suspects gather into one room for a classic agatha christie-style ending but the solution to the mystery is a complete bore br br here's a question for those who have already seen this not a spoiler why wouldn't the commodore have reused the s stencil rather than asking for two
