this production was recently shown on dutch tv the tv-guide announced it as a very poor predator ripp-off since the original predator is one of my favourites i taped xtro for later reference one day waiting on a cable guy i decided to view it it was a long wait i can tell you that the urge of pressing the ff button every second scene was so enormous that i had to give in this piece of junk does not even qualify as a cult-thing by any standard there is nothing to laugh about and script/acting/screenplay/continuity are so poor that you wonder why in the hell garbage like this makes it on video and national tv don`t waste your time on this one go rent the original predator find a big screen tv some dolby stuff and let that cable guy stand in the rain for an hour or two
