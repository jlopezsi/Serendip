got the dvd today hilarious we were absolutely so impressed and have already shared it with friends the book of caleb is a successful wildly entertaining coming of age film everything is topnotch acting directing camera-work editing narration almost forgot the most important part the concept and the writing great storyline that i feel many people can relate to on some level br br i'm a pretty anal artist and this movie really measures up loved the scene when scar got his scar beautifully shot great use of combining black and white with color the only thing that bothered me a little was the use of people talking without hearing their words the idea is good but i feel it could have been executed in such a way that it would feel more intentional br br casting was right on best of luck and i'll promote it without any reservations br br j sherman
