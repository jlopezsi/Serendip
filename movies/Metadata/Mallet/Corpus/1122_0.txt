shame on new line cinema for releasing such crap like the man samuel l jackson and eugene levy can do a hell of a lot better than this and they have there is nothing remotely funny or entertaining to be found in this lame attempt to make people laugh wait excuse me i did laugh once and i will tell you what at the only time i laughed in this movie is when eugene levy's character eats red meat and then gets in samuel l jackson's car seems the red meat gives him gas and soon the farts are coming out left and right the expressions on samuel l jackson's face made me crack up but unfortunately that is the only laugh to be had all i can tell you is do not i repeat do not watch this movie
