i first saw this movie on hbo as a child i couldn't remember the name of th movie or who played in it but i couldn't get the scene of albert finney on the commercial set near the end of the movie out of my mind after asking around using that scene as my only guide i was finally able to get someone to tell me br br after watching it again i was very interested in the movie's plot despite how ridiculous it seemed for example why would ri security officers be at the scene of a car accident why didn't dmi use computers to generate locations as well as models or why did the mustachioed man suddenly remember he had those special glasses in the car chase scene only after being shot by the looker gun there are others br br but it has it's redeeming qualities as well the music is captivating and helps to build on the excitement of some of the action scenes and i don't believe i've seen a more passionate kick to the groin than the one given by albert finney all in all looker would probably not stand up next to today's movies but it has a charm about it it must have made some kind of impression on me as a child to remain in my head for the past 25 years recommended rental buy it if you like off-beat quasi-mainstream movies i bought it and plan on getting good use out of it perfect for unsuspecting house guests
