not really awful but one will always wonder what possessed the immensely talented samuel l jackson and eugene levy to make this film together maybe it was some sort of a deal or perhaps even a dare br br it is immensely familiar to see the opposites in buddy comedy territory but usually there is some kind of twist think lethal weapon or the original odd couple the difference is in this case is that none of the characters are suicidal br br this is not to say that i didn't enjoy some of the moments in here levy is incredibly good at playing the nebbish and of course jackson could do his part in his sleep there is even a little scene that references some of jackson's previous work with regards to him using the f-word like he had some kind of reverse v-chip installed within him br br ultimately this is a failed attempt even the villain is not all that evil he seems rather pleasant except for the fact that he is involved in criminal activity br br so if you absolutely don't have anything else to do watch this you will not die laughing but you will be mildly entertained
