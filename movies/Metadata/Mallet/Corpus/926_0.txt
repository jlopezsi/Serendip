granted i haven't seen this movie in quite some time but i had to drop by and defend it's honor after reading some of the others reviews written about it i once stumbled upon this movie a couple years back as a young teenager and adored it in fact i am always checking to see if it comes on again but unfortunately i haven't been able to find it since i remember that rob lowe played someone in debt to the devil and fell in love with an angel who was working in disguise as a waitress there were many funny scenes and michael york made a fanstastic devil they always filmed scenes with him after taking the usual express elevator to hell anyway i believe if i'm not mistaken that the angel's duty was to in fact save him in the end it was very touching and magical in a sense if you do not expect more than you will love it just don't take things too seriously
