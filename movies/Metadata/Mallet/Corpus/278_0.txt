though nothing can beat la cage aux folles the film on which this american version is based i still found the birdcage delightful fun and hilarious at times thanks to the comic geniuses of robin williams and nathan lane lane is the dramatic albert an over the top drag queen who has lived for years with robin williams armand the owner of the birdcage where albert performs armand once had a liaison with a woman which produced a son val who now wants to be married to the daughter of a conservative politician in order for that to occur armand has to become butch all gay art work etc needs to exit the apartment and albert must disappear for a few days br br williams is hilarious my two favorite scenes are his rehearsal with albert and a young man appearing with him on stage and the scene where he coaches armand on being macho priceless nathan lane's shtick is familiar to me as i've seen him in the producers and the odd couple he's a riot as the insecure jealous easily hurt albert br br the role of val is problematic because how does one keep him from looking like a complete bastard as he shuts out armand who raised him but dan futterman and calista flockhart as barbara make a lovely young couple gene hackman and dianne wiest are very funny as barbara's befuddled parents br br it's been a long time since i've seen the french la cage aux folles and i saw the musical on broadway as well the french is superior to any version the musical is quite poignant and emphasizes its statement in the song i am who i am the joy of the french film is that the actors playing the lovers ugo tognazzi and michel serrault play their roles very seriously and the humor and poignancy come out of the situation and the outrageousness of the armand character albin/zaza in the french in the birdcage it's played for comedy all the way that's okay you'll still enjoy it but see the original
