galactic odyssey the american title of starquest ii was a horrible movie the plot was amazingly bad and the writing was some of the worst that i've ever seen the overall premise a group of humans kidnapped to start a breeding program on another planet seems fairly standard that's when everything starts to break down br br first the movie is interspersed with a lot of war footage from different places on the planet none of it has anything to do with the people in the movie there's a long montage at the beginning of various science fiction stories none of it has anything to do with the plot of the movie br br second the effects and sets are bad i mean manos hands of fate bad the airlock that closes off to prevent the ship from decompressing you can see the lights on the other side of the door because the door doesn't close all of the way the robot pilot that gets blown out of the broken bridge window because of decompression he takes a nice stroll over when he's caught by the decompression just horrible the alien hands on the actors seemed to have been bought from the props department of another movie another cheap badly made movie br br third the soft-core porn sex throughout this movie was a little bit of overkill kate rodger gretchen palmer and jolie jackunas are all hot no doubt but did they really have to have sex every ten minutes throughout the movie the women that i know would not respond to a kidnapped at the last second before earth was destroyed situation by doing it as much as they did from an entertainment standpoint this made the movie watchable from a plot standpoint it was ludicrous br br fourth the plot were the humans kidnapped because earth was destroyed or because it was going to be destroyed were they breeding to be harvested or breeding to save the human race nothing was remotely clear worse nothing was remotely consistent the story changed as the movie went on br br eh there's better porn on the internet watch mystery science theater instead
