i recently saw this film at the santa barbara film festival in california the person who introduced the film described it as being similar to 21 grams i agree with this statement however where 21 grams left me feeling sad and hopeless i left this movie with a smile on my face and filled with optimism br br sceenwriter alejandro hernandez says the story is about second chances and hope hard times are only the prelude to something better the movie poster proclaims life may be full of hard times but it is ultimately worth it this is the feeling it gave me br br it is an ensemble piece full of some great spanish actors notably leonor watling and javier camera who give great performances the characters lives intertwine as they deal with turning points in their lives br br i gave it a 9 because i felt it was a little slow in places but besides the pace i think this film has a lot to offer and we can learn from it the characters deal with struggles from relationships ending fear work problems and low self esteem but by confiding in others they find ways to turn their lives around br br i recommend this movie if you need a pick-me-up and if you enjoy spanish cinema because this is one of the best spanish films i have seen recently
