i won't bore you with the plot except to say it's not any more believable than the acting most of the cast seemed to be capable of acting but the juvenile script and direction make it a waste of time this movie sucks on so many different levels it never had a chance i was almost embarrassed to watch it the way you would be embarrassed to see a friend make a fool of himself when he was drunk like seeing someone at a very low point in his or her life after watching it i had to look up what ebert said about it and marvel at the fact he liked it most movies these days are awful i guess if you're movie reviewer you can't write bad reviews on everything at the end i thought it might have a twist to save it somewhat but it turned out the end was just as bad as the rest of it
