i am stunned to see the vast majority of commentators describe this great film as typical sentimental and melodramatic that is to completely overlook the various philosophical and psychological aspects of the movie isolationism pacifism opposition to global hegemony and tyranny all of these are at the essence of the dialog and the story the need for humans to deny the temptation to live in the past and to embrace the future is the core of the movie in addition to its title reason must overcome emotionalism br br that is made especially apparent in the scene where kessler orson welles implicitly compares mrs hamilton claudette colbert to his young charge margaret natalie wood while mrs hamilton lost her husband on another continent the nazis murdered margaret's parents right before her eyes she is terrified by a popper because it causes her to relive the sound of bullets the smell of gunpowder and the sight of blood her parents blood kessler gently coaxes margaret into pulling the string on a second popper to prove that she doesn't need to be a victim of her fears she can learn that it is not dangerous but a mere toy she can overcome br br the climactic scene between kessler and mrs hamilton is equally fabulous the tension steadily mounts as mrs hamilton presses kessler to admit that he is her husband until his direct denial the dialog is so sublime that it makes sense whether delivered by the woman's lost husband or by mr kessler but it is not sentimental to the contrary kessler's powerful philosophical arguments and psychological insights compel mrs hamilton to reassess her life and come to the realization that it has been is and promises to be good to throw that away for a memory would be sheer sentimental folly embrace the good life you have is the very clear message br br this movie has layers upon layers it contains paradoxes and ironies that are profound enough for real reflection the characters provide profound contrasts in philosophy and psychology the device of having a husband apparently die but in actuality refuse to return home because of his broken condition provides ample opportunity for sentimentality but that device is merely the springboard for a much richer exploration of the meaning of life and our place in the world to fail to recognize this is to minimize this fabulous film and miss its point br br generally the acting is superb however in particular this is possibly orson welles finest performance there are no obvious double-takes or overly-long stares that are dead give-aways in most films that deal with a character with a hidden identity this is a fabulously subtle performance welles makeup is a little obvious and theatrical but is not a distraction br br in an incredible and incredibly overlooked performance natalie wood convincingly portrays a young austrian girl who speaks german as her native tongue has lost both parents to nazi violence and is suddenly thrust into a strange new country her performance is one of the best juvenile performances in all american cinema br br the max steiner score is also very good although i wish it had been a little more sub rosa just turning down the volume of the score to make it a little more subtle would have improved the film a little however it beautifully captures the mood of each scene
