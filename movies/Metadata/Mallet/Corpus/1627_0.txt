crime wave has the makings for something quite simple as a movie its story is about cops and criminals and a few ordinary folks trying to get by a few criminals the main ones played by ted de corsia and a young charles bronson are out of san quentin and shoot a gas station attendant and cop on the lam they hold up with also ex-con steve lacey decent leading man gene nelson with his wife but what they don't know is that he's already been tapped by the cops specifically sterling hayden's detective sims who is so hard-nosed he could cut through bricks with just a stare and some tough words it all leads up to one of those heists that just can't go right for the bad guys but what about the good couple caught in the middle br br it is fairly straightforward and it could have been in other hands but there's something about andre de toth as director that stands crime wave out as a piece of lean noir cuisine the way it's shot is one thing as his european influence comes through in a lot of the exteriors and his way of utilizing natural lighting and real locations or just how he has someone like a room that looks too real like sims office his camera has a distinct tone to it even when sets or usual shots in moving cars have to be done and it cuts through the bs and keeps one riveted even as one knows what's going to happen the last couple of minutes with sims and the lacey's are one of them br br it also can't be stressed how awesome an actor sterling hayden is in everything he just brings that umph that is required whether it's to a hoodlum or a psychotic or a corrupt cop and in crime wave his authority as a presence six foot five inches and his pattern of speech play off well against the rest of the usual character actors save maybe for charles bronson since he too is unique even at a young age and creepy character actor timothy carey as the man put on watch of mrs lacey overall crime wave is a procedural that snaps and crackles and pops for 72 minutes and allows fans of classic film noir to soak up the atmosphere and have a good time seeing the coppers close in on the crooks who as almost always is the case don't stand a chance
