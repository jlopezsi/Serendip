1 giant leap was nominated for two academy awards in 2003 and should have won it is a unique creation specifically originally made in non-sequential chapters for dvd ie not a plot-linear movie transferred to digital format the music is stunning world genre and the visuals are exceptionally special it is not a rehash of baraka or koyaanisquatsi but if you were impressed by either of them and/or if you love world music you need to see 1gl it also carries some very interesting and pertinent comment on many political/philosophical themes my only criticism is it's a bit over-respectful perhaps of specifically hindi spirituality
