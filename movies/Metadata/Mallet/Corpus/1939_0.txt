i can't understand why people attack this movie the acting was fine the sfx and directing are obviously not going to be as great as the original because there is no spielburg the shark in my opinion looked good enough too many people watched this movie expecting it to by like jaws 1975 if you lower your standards this movie is very entertaining 3 out of 5 stars
