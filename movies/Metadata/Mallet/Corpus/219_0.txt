shortly after an oddly quiet young woman sadako yamamura yukie nakama joins a drama troupe strange events including deaths with suspicious circumstances start occurring is sadako somehow connected to these events and what does it have to do with a reporter investigating a years-old tragedy at a psychic demonstration br br series note there are many different films television series books comic books etc based on the ring universe and it's very complicated trying to sort them out the japanese films known as ring or ringu can be numbered 0 this one 1 ringu 1998 and 2 ringu 2 1999 and function well as a self-contained story this film ring 0 birthday is a prequel i prefer watching it first but if you want more mystery in the other films watch them in their release order ringu ringu 2 then ringu 0 note that there is also a japanese film named rasen aka spiral 1998 which was meant to be a ring 2 but that was later superseded with the 1999 ringu 2 rasen is supposedly closer to the second ring novel but 1999's ringu 2 is seen as more or less the official ringu sequel br br there is an infamous mock commercial from the early days of saturday night live 1975 about a product named shimmer shimmer was notable for being both a floor wax and a dessert topping ring 0 has sadako as a shimmer-like entity only instead of being just two kinds of things she's six a telekinetic a psychic a precognizant a ghost a psychic healer and a physical manifestation of a split personality the film overall has a shimmer-like quality too it's both a horror film and a slow realistic drama with romance overtones the horror stuff generally works although sadako would have benefited from not having so many functions the more serious dramatic sections which take up almost an hour of this 90-minute film are not quite as successful br br the script by hiroshi takahashi from a story by ring novelist koji suzuki is admirable on an artistic level takahashi is fond of parallelism setting up the drama troupe's rehearsals and performance as an innocuous veil that often matches more sinister events beneath the surface he frequently changes our perspective so that we see a stage performer scream say at the same time someone offstage should be screaming these kinds of parallels can be found throughout the film br br the problem is that director norio tsuruta just cannot get much momentum going with the material the dramatic rehearsals and backstage bickering that take up a large percentage of screen-time just aren't that eventful or exciting there are glimpses through sadako or around her of a more intriguing world but they're often little more than flashes that might cause us to do a double take takahashi and tsuruta work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle or two but this can barely get off the ground it often feels superfluous br br the best material featuring sadako in the earlier part of the film resembles something of a cross between a hitchcockian thriller and brian de palma's carrie 1976 but those are overly generous comparisons since at least the first hour of ring 0 has little of the suspense style or directorial panache of either br br i would have preferred a stronger focus on shoko miyaji yoshiko tanaka the reporter who is trying to investigate the psychic demonstration tragedy her scenes which tend to have the flavor of a police procedural with slight horror twinges are entertaining and a larger focus on her would have broken up play rehearsal scenes better it would have also given the character more weight for the climax which would have given the ending even greater impact br br as it stands the last half hour is still the best part we finally unravel much of the mystery behind sadako although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film which otherwise can seem cryptic it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over i enjoyed it more the second time br br there are a number of events during the climax that are breathtaking in their brutality all nicely scripted and directed one of these when two characters are enigmatically killed off-screen is a rare example of an attack scene where i agree that what you're not shown can be more effective than what you are shown we get to see the event leading right up to the death and we see the bloody aftermath filming how it happened would have drained much of its mystique another outstanding development in the climax is rooted in the relationship between two characters and works so well because of strong cultural taboos br br while it's probably my least favorite ring-related film ring 0 is worth viewing because of its place in the series and the excellent climax
