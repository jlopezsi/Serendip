i first thought the film was okay but i enjoyed it only because of my curiosity stemming from the film's rarity not too many people in the godzilla fan community have seen it and it should stay that way when i rewatched it i started getting bored within the first minute many scenes drag on needlessly e.g the sex scene against a space backdrop stretching the film's running time to an unbearable 2 hours and no good bad movie can be 2 hours long many scenes are inane e.g the sex scene the hippies the characters trying to sabotage the jupiter solarization project are horribly annoying because their merely brats who want to be responsible for the deaths of 200 billion people they have no motivation for this they're just stupid annoying selfish sanctimonious punks and of course their leader is french-looking despite the running time you barely know most of the characters and then they try to milk some tears from you by some pointless death scenes it breaks the don't show a good movie in the middle of your crappy movie rule by intercutting a fistfight with scenes from ghidrah the three headed monster in what i assume is a vapid nongermane and utterly pointless social commentary the music is something out of a high school graduation repetitive and grating there's gratuitous cruelty to animals mixed with a laughably bad rubber shark and dolphin the only good part of this movie are the excellent special effects excluding the shark and dophin but they are too few and far between br br this entire movie just ticks me off especially since it took money and good special effects people away from gojira 1984 it just tries to grasp at your heartstrings but it's filled with stupid dull annoying characters you'd just love to beat the crap out of and filler on the level of the refueling scenes from the starfighters absolutely one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br 1/10 it'd be 0 if imdb's ratings went that low
