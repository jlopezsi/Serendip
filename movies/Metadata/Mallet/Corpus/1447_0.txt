as unoriginal as the plot seems and as poor as this film did in the box office i found it to be both enjoyable and engrossing from the few moments that harold was on film i wanted him to get the girl there was no one better to play the girl than the talented and lovely sherilyn fenn the plot is a bit too predictable and simple(boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back for good but the acting of both sherilyn and jeremy bring it to life by the time the film was over i had a new respect for the romantic comedy genre a great film for a date or just to relax with on a weekend
