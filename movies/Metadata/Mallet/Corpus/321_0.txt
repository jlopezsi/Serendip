based on a phillip k dick story the writer of do androids dream of electric sheep which was the background for blade runner this movie delivers but suffers because of the apparently tight budget some scenes in here reminded me of the original star trek episodes where the production crew had to become quite inventive to get effects on an almost non-existing budget br br so movies low on money have to rely on their scripts and on good actors and screamers has them both the story and its subplots could serve for three movies and especially peter weller showed a superb performance here generally there are some weaknesses but they can be forgiven if you allow yourself to get into the story br br if you have enough of fx loaded movies that cover their thin plot with a multitude of explosions then give it a try
