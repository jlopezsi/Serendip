the truth is that about 80 of the people who see have seen this movie won't like it why because it is not that original but in saying that i happen to belong to the 20 who really like it br br i first saw it back in the eighties when i was about 8 or 9 years old now almost 20 years on i saw it again and it really brought back nostalgic memories from when i was a kid br br some people say this movie has bad acting i don't agree at all while the story might not be the best ever there is definitely nothing wrong with the acting and the supersonic maiden one plane looks absolutely stunning even though it is 70's b-tv-movie material br br i really recommend it to fans of disaster movies it is hard to get a hold of these days but if you have a chance to see it do so
