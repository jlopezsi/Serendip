this is a perfect example of a series that long outlived its usefulness i loved pinky and the brain and watched the show almost religiously but when some dunderhead at the wb decided to pair these mice with elmyra i was horrified there was absolutely no reason to take them away from acme labs except that the show had just run out of ideas this was an example of the expression jumping the shark it was obvious it was all downhill for the show from then until its cancellation and with crappy episodes without the original formula it wasn't long before the show breathed its last frankly i just found it embarrassing to watch towards the end my recommendation is never watch this incarnation of the show and use massive amounts of denial convince yourselves and others it never occurred the only shows that ever existed were animaniacs and pinky and the brain they never paired the mice with elmyra no never
