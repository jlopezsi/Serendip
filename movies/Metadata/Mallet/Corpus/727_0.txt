the charm of this movie is in the concept and perfect casting robert de niro satirizes his past performances as a mafia boss and billy crystal as the unwitting psychiatrist who gets involved in the mess it's truly funny and entertaining the movie mostly benefits from very good direction by harold ramis and excellent performance by the actors and not just de niro and crystal br br the verdict 4 of 5 stars
