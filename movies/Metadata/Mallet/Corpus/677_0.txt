in 1852 in galicia spain the traveling vendor manuel blanco romasanta is tried for the murder of at least fifteen persons he claims to be the ninth son of a family and therefore a werewolf and queen isabel ii changes his death sentence to life once in prison he dies for unknown cause br br first of all i would like to tell that i am not writing a spoiler most of this information is on the box of the brazilian dvd and in many reviews i believe the lack of mystery with the lead character i.e the viewer knows who is the killer before watching the film is the greatest flaw in this screenplay the story is great recalling la pacte des loups the cinematography and effects are wonderful and julian sands and elsa pataky have excellent performances and chemistry with the story centered in their romance first and in the rage of b√°rbara for romasanta later however i have never heard about this romasanta and the writer used fictional and historical events to write this story with elements of horror and romance i believe he could have kept the mystery about romasanta disclosing his crimes only in the end anyway this movie is original and very attractive and really worth watching my vote is seven br br title brazil romasanta a casa da besta romasanta the house of the beast
