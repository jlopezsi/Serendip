adapted from perhaps one of the greatest dark story tellers of the past edgar allan poe br br this film was very enjoyable oliver reeds accent was very believable but i was really surprised at how a big name actor like reed only had a very small part in the film br br mark margolis of equalizer fame played a really good part very dark br br rona de ricci who played maria she was in my opinion the real star of the film it's surprising then that she seems to have been in only two films she is both a very talented actress and a strikingly beautiful woman br br lance henrikson played his part extremely well as the very tortured inquisitor br br the scene with the rats brilliant br br over all this film is one that i will remember
