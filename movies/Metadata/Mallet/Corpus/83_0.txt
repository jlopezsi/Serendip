a concorde with a terrible paint job and a passenger list of half-wits begins to have trouble in the air br br i didn't care that mike brady was the captain i didn't care that ben cartwright was one of the airport big-shots i didn't even care that when the plane wrecked and burst into a giant fireball everybody on board would die a bloody screaming death as a matter of fact i was hoping for the plane to explode yeah that would be good because then i could see every one of these dildoes fry and watch them float down to earth in a shower of bacon bits br br thank you for burning beyond recognition with dumbbell airlines
