this has been one of my top five favorite movies since the first time i saw it steve martin and carl reiner are a pair nothing less than genius from two of the best it is hard to imagine what the editors must have been thinking when splicing together all of the scenes in this movie the writing fits perfectly and melds steve martin's rigby reardon character with scenes from some of my favorite film noir favorite scenes include rigby inviting himself to a party hosted by ingrid bergman the scenes with humphrey bogart talking about bogey's tie too funny rachel ward's juliet removing the bullet from rigby's arm and it goes on and on this is a must see for fans of steve martin carl reiner and all of those wonderful old movies
