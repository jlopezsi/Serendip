ok you do not expect much from a 1994 movie you have never heard of and is being given for free with the purchase of a bad magazine least while for strange developments in your life all of this happens to take place in bilbao spain br br but this is a fine movie a very good one the plot flows very well very fluidly it goes surprising you on and on but in a subtle soft way br br at the end you feel a lot of empathy for the naive japanese guy and in my case a deep love for shelly i canÂ´t tell you more about it without spoiling it br br watch it
