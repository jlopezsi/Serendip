this is an enjoyable and surprisingly competent dtv follow up to cult hit ginger snaps the first film was dark entertaining and witty and had a good amount of tension and scares the sequel is good fun but lacks the wit of the original and a certain amount of the hip-ness the lack of ginger herself is also evident katherine isabelle is back but essentially in a cameo as the ghost of ginger while once again the angst ridden sister bridget is the centre of the story following the events of the first film bridget is on the run moving from town to town and constantly taking monkshood the drug that prevents werewolfism to stop her turning into a werewolf following the final confrontation in the first film when she is found overdosing on the stuff she falls into a coma and wakes up in a mental hospital but soon she is tracked down by another werewolf and with no monkshood to slow down her own transformation she must fight her impending hairiness as she has found monkshood doesn't prevent wolfiness only slows the transformation at the institute she meets the eccentric ghost who is fascinated with bridget and soon learns of her problem when a residents of the institute start turning up dead ghost initially suspects bridget but they soon discover that a mate is tracking bridget to make hairy werewolf babies with her as well as this ghost may not be quite as she seems this is well shot and has some tense moments and considering its small budget it is a remarkably accomplished and enjoyable piece of work a good and more low key ginger snaps movie it is
