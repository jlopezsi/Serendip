okay so this was not as explosive as the first beverly hills cop movie but it still had enough energy to succeed eddie murphy is great here his portrayal of axel foley in cop ii is just as hilarious as the character was in cop i look for appearances by chris rock and gilbert gottfried they are funny too it is a must-see sequel
