match 1 d'lo brown c vs val venis for the european championship pretty decent opener back in the late 90's d'lo could really work a decent match but as of his recent performances on raw in 2008 i'm not impressed anymore so basically these two go at it for with wwe's now defunct european title on the line venis looked pretty good in the ring his character was still relatively fresh at this time but anyway towards the end of the match val gets himself disqualified which means d'lo retains the title br br match 2 the oddities kurrgan golga and giant silva with luna vachon and the insane clown posse vs kaientai taka michinoku dick togo mens teioh and sho funaki with yamaguchi-san in a handicap match extremely weak match i did like the oddities as comic relief but guys like kurrgan and golga did better as singles wrestlers this as j.r says in the commentary is not a classic anyway the oddities squash their way to a victory over kaientai br br match 3 jeff jarrett vs x-pac in a hair vs hair match the first good match of the night these two put out a very crowd pleasing match at this particular summerslam x-pac is able to score the win but jarrett retreats from getting his hair cut he is brought back to the ring shortly and they cut his formerly long hair into the look he had all through wcw and in tna br br match 4 marc mero jacqueline vs edge sable a great way to get the young edge over edge has always been tremendous in the ring and even though he faces off with the talentless marc mero he still manages to put on a decent match in the end edge and sable get the win br br match 5 ken shamrock vs owen hart in a lion's den match this match was off the hook owen hart completely ruled the ring if it wasn't for his death he would have been wwe champion at some point this match was absolutely awesome shamrock is able to defeat owen in the end but i still applaud owen because he was such a great wrestler he's a guy that needs to be in the wwe hall of fame br br match 6 mankind c vs the new age outlaws for the wwf/e tag team championship this was just a low and lame match kane is the tag team partner of mankind but he doesn't show so mankind is left to fend alone against road dogg and billy gunn in the end they get the win over mankind and claim the tag titles again br br match 7 the rock c vs triple h in a ladder match for the intercontinental championship the match of the night these two incredible veterans put out a great match at this point both the rock and the game were on the verge of becoming main eventers and i think this match made it for them honestly a fantastic must watch match in the end triple h grabs the title to win br br match 8 stone cold steve austin c vs undertaker for the wwf/e championship great main event really one of summerslam's best matches of all time madison square garden completely was behind austin as he went into battle with the undertaker for his championship after a vicious battle austin hits the stunner to retain the title crowd was completely ecstatic
