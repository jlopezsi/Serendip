with the movie market being so saturated with cheesy action and overplayed drama flicks what a breath of fresh air it is to see a movie about people that have real problems clockwatchers captures all the essences of the work place the monotony the hierarchy and all the nuances of tedious day to day temp work here you have 4 women who are capable of so much more in their life yet they're so afraid to act on their dreams that they settle for crappy temp jobs excellent acting by toni collette in the lead role as iris nods to parker posey as well all the girls nailed their parts strongly and the strong acting along with a great script created a very real and believable story with real and believable characters definitely see it 4 stars
