i'm trying to hold a family together speaks cherry jones as julia to her husband robert knott who plays the part of will in this compelling story of a waterman's family on chesapeake bay's eastern shore excellent performances from both actors as well as from tara gallagher mike mosley sarah paulson and sean hatosy in supporting roles financial pressures and strains from will's drinking issues take the family to the breaking point and everyone is affected by the struggle doug sadler's movie brilliantly scripted is a winner on all accounts and holds a mirror to reflect what is common in so many people's lives yes that can be uncomfortable at times but it is real and jarring in it's truths sadler manages to provide just enough levity through the film to keep us hopeful that everyone will pull through somehow if you are looking for special effects violence gratuitous sex and nudity this is not the film to see but if you want a good story well told and beautifully filmed this is it and worth watching more than once
