i didn't expect to rate this movie more than a 4 before i saw it the director has taken a plot which looks boring and trite and turned it into a unexpectedly good movie lots of clever lines(ala neil simon)and excellent performances by all actors i gave this a 7 rating and should be watched whenever one wants something just fun to watch
