the movie is a bit sloppy from a technical standpoint but it remains the only movie to make me literally laugh myself sick the farrelly brothers owe a huge debt to robert klane's mining of the twisted humor genre for years this was my video holy grail finally it occurred to me that it probably showed up from time to time on the fox movie channel so not having it on my cable system i started buying the monthly satellite programming guides and when it came up in the rotation on fmc i had a friend tape it for me a simple dvd release will not be adequate this needs the full special edition treatment and oh how i hope there are outtakes
