most people that see the kill bill films especially vol 1 and then see a work that inspired kill bill like shurayukihime feel let down some how that they didn't see the same exact film twice br br no you won't hear the main femme fatal talk about cheeseburgers and she doesn't go to china to be trained by pai mei another lifted character btw but what we do get with this film is pure excitement ultra-violent blood-spurting sexy lead woman excitement all set in a period backdrop we get to see the work from the originators not the imitators br br if you like samurai/revenge flicks with authentic flavor plenty of gore and some beautiful photography check this one out heck i recommend this to fans of kb vol 1 as well br br just don't expect pop culture references
