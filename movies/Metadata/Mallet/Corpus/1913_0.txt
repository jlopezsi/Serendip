tho this movie was uneven the quirky humor was invigorating i rated it 7 partly because there were some concepts i had not seen in movies previously br br the young leads were personable and presented their characters quite admirably their car itself becomes a personality in the show br br you will find several actors you haven't seen in years some shine in the light of this movie others well nuff said br br the music of king sunny ade his african beats was refreshing the juju music was at the same time full of energy and joy was gentle almost like meditation br br if you are looking for a pleasant diversion strongly unique in places i highly recommend it
