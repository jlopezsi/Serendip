i picked up this movie some years ago and watched it twice just to get all of the gags at 1130pm i called my friends over to watch and again laughed and laughed the ads are a great part of the show but the characters are almost representative of the ad biz having dealt with ad folks in my career i often thought many of them either belonged in a home or had just been released from one how i wish we could see some of that truth in advertising these days especially in the political campaigns it is by far one of my favourite movies one that i replay at least once yearly agree with others it was moore's funniest and finest performance
