i just finished watching all 3 seasons and for the most part i thought it was good season 1 was great then season 2 introduced the george hearst situation which after building up for 2 seasons i felt was a really crap finale i mean hearst hired 50 pinkertons whilst finally getting mrs ellsworth to sign over her claim so al swearengen sent off for reinforcements mr wu's men and hawkeye's men but then hearst just up and left i mean all that build-up all those pinkertons and they just left without a single gun-shot i feel almost cheated additionally we never did hear the results of the elections and was anyone else curious why they turned wyatt earp and his brother morgan into total morons and the way wild bill hickok died with his back turned playing poker what the hell could have made that a bit more interesting and the relationship between bullock and mrs ellsworth that needs resolving and what happened about mrs ellsworth's offer to e.b farnum to buy his hotel she didn't seem at all bothered that he didn't sell to her but did sell to mr hearst and to be honest was all the swearing really necessary they need to make a 4 season to answer these problems
