before seeing this movie i did expect it to be a no budget so bad its good zombie flick what i saw was a lot worse first of all zombiegeddon has a very dull script lord zombie william smith is creating human-like zombies and sends them to earth this is just pathetic i don't understand why in hell did people like edwin neal tom savini brinke stevens felissa rose linnea quigley robert z'dar and joe estevez even appear in this movie edwin neal plays god tom savini plays jesus crist robert z'dar appears for only 5 mins and even makes fun of his own cult movie the maniac cop br br the effects are cheap and unrealistic awful soundtrack the directing is even worse zombie make-up is none-existent some zombies are kickboxers and kung-fu fighters the acting is beyond bad in the beginning of the movie director uwe boll tells us not to watch this movie because its bad well after seeing zombiegeddon i'll have to admit he was right his house of the dead was better than this br br so to sum it up don't watch this movie its really that bad and believe me i've seen bad movies this one is worse than zombie lake flesheaters bloodeaters meat market redneck zombies bone sickness etc all of the b-movie stars listed above appear for only a couple of minutes each other actors are absolutely awful the movie isn't funny isn't scary isn't interesting isn't shocking the only movie i can think of right now that is worse than zombiegeddon is probably zombiez 1/10
