while obviously this isn't a perfect education of the horrors of the holocaust it's not meant to be this movie was based on a young adults book and it's transformed into a young adults movie it's not supposed to be a perfectly accurate portrayal and it's not meant for historians or anything but it is a touching film and excellent education for people to understand what it was like then there are many powerful moments in the movie a particularly impressive part to me was when kirsten dunst's character points to the number branded on her arm and cries i wanted one of these referring to a tattoo i think the highlight however was brittany murphy's incredible part she was virtually unrecognizable and her acting was superb she literally threw herself into the part and she shines she truly is one of the greatest things about this movie
