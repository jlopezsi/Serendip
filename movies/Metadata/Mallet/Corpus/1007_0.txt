only film geeks could get anything out of this piece of garabage i meant to spell it that way by the way listen anyway this film premiered in tulsa oklahoma with a pretty darn loyal following pretty darn excited to see it it was awful a complete waste of money felissa rose was the only saving grace to this turkey about zombies who are sent from the devil the acting is about the worst acting in cinema history even brink stevens and tom savini couldn't save it ugh 0/10
