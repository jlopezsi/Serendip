if you're looking for clear plot pay-offs this is a movie for which you should probably wait on the dvd br br nicole kidman's flawless form adorns the prow of this doomed but baroque ship of fools and nearly redeems it entirely by force of sheer elegance br br as a soon-to-be-wed new york nabob of indistinguishable profession she is confronted by a ten-year-old boy claiming to be the man who widowed her ten years earlier reincarnated but a former inlaw may have something to say about the husband's reappearance and her fianc s none too pleased either br br this film may prove compelling to those in the audience who've suffered the untimely loss of a spouse but we are given very little reason to care about either kidman's character or her would-be grade-school suitor indeed her fianc seems the most genuinely human character in the picture as he finally snaps under the weight of the sheer absurdity of the situation and takes the boy across his knee the ethereal kidman and the even more otherworldly boy played by cameron bright each seem somewhat malevolent and selfish in a couple borderline irresponsible scenes they bathe together and exchange thoughts on the sexual dynamics their union might entail artsy br br you might say the film is about duking it out with your lover's past or coping with lost love and infidelity but in the end if you're like me you are not going to care about these people no matter how hard you try and in a character-driven film like this that's pretty much the whole ballgame br br but the cinematography and pacing are brilliant also as mentioned you get to look at nicole kidman in full elvis for a hundred minutes and there's far worse ways to spend an evening br br as i said a decent rental for a dull evening some night but don't lay out the nine dollars br br this movie review by erik gloor
