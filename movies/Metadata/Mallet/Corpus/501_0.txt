i found ackroyd to be completely horrible he looked more like joe friday than elwood blues his chicago accent was forced the dialog moved through at a horribly slow pace there was absolutely zero comic timing in this movie every scene in the movie including the musical numbers took too long-from elwood talking to the penguin to the car chases-long shots of police cars-to the car-under-the-water routing-to the 50 car pile up that seemed to take 10 minutes br br the musical numbers-the lifeblood of the original-were completely devoid of soul aretha franklin's lip-syncing in particular was horrible matt guitar murphy looked more like a broken down old man than the body-builder he did in the original who could believe that the dunn and cropper radio talk show could possibly exist when they both seemed to be reading off of cue cards the entire movie br br the things that we funny and subtle in the first film-elwood's parking ability jake's transformation at the hands of reverend cleophus the miracle performance of the bluesmobile the new jobs of the former band members were hackneyed and overdone in this film br br the lack of energy from the band though is the coffin nail for this film br br they perform with such little life that cgi animation of a skeleton riding a skeletal horse over the stage has to be imposed during their rendition of ghost rider this comes from the same blues brothers band that made the theme to rawhide sound like a hit twenty years ago br br finally the movie seems too bright and too clean the original took place at night for the most part and seemed dungier this film is shiny and clean and that just doesn't feel right the new bluesmobile didn't even look right until elwood littered up the dashboard with trash and-get this-the cigarette lighter worked br br other fatal flaws dumbing-down elwood blues inserting a kid into the cast having elwood eat something other than dry white toast the shaving-cream-ball schtick no scmods no lines like man i haven't been pulled over in six months all the jokes hit you in the face-like they all have to be explained complete bomb br br
