after watching the real crow if you watch the the crow series you just want to cry it is freaking ridiculous don't watch that you'll want to suicide it is really a bad remake all the mystery the dark side of all the story is completely destroyed that series was a real mistake even the special effects in the first movie filmed 4 years earlier were better than these ones plus the actors doesn't fit in the story the casting director is really a clown or he was doped when he chose the actors the producer certainly gave the budget of the film to the casting director for buying his dope or he really doesn't know how to manage a budget don't pay for this dumb tv series don't even borrow them from someone you'd really want to cry
