i've grown up wanting to play other people to slip into their lives and see how they're different and similar to myself i didn't actually get involved in pen-and-paper rpg's until i graduated from college and haven't found many computer or console games that have been of any interest to me br br that is until i played one of the final fantasy games the first game i played was ffvi which was what iii in japan and i was hooked i loved the characters and i was annoyed when the couples at the end didn't work out the way i wanted them to but i loved the way everything meshed together and it wasn't simply a matter of running from point a to point b and beating up anything that got in your way br br then i started playing ff8 and i was completely blown away just the opening graphics stunned me and i hadn't even started the game itself yet i haven't quite finished the game yet i started over cause i got confused over an aspect of the guardian forces so i got to a battle that was impossible for me to win and i couldn't get away from it but i've made it through 3/4 of it and all i can say is that i've never seen a video game that made me cry but this one accomplished it br br i look at the game as an outsider to the industry i hate the fighting games where you do nothing but face off against an opponent in the ring i see no point to them the run-around-with-big-guns-and-blow-things-up games do nothing for me either i like the games that are more like puzzles and that make you think about what you're doing like tetris mah jong things like that however ff8 gets the highest rating i can give a game because i find it fascinating and beautifully made others who have played bazillions of other games find things wrong with ff8 left and right because it's different from what they're used to since i went into it with an open mind of sorts however all i can see is the overpowering beauty and emotion of the characters animation and design
