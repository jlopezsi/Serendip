i watch fire sale at least 3-4 times a year and each time it gets better very similar to where's poppa which also demands multiple viewings while where's poppa has one extremely funny story line fire sale has two the insurance scam running parallel to the basketball player adoption are absolutely two of the funniest ideas in any film my only criticism is that alan arkin lets several scenes run on entirely too long nevertheless there are moments of hilarious dark comedy throughout and don't forget to put my beer back measuring a live corpse etc this is one of the greatest comedies ever made and will achieve instant cult status if ever released on dvd merk
