i have never seen such an atrocious pathetic attempt at a crime thriller the complete ignorance to the truth of the way computers and the internet work was only one of the poor elements of this film but it managed to disappoint in every other aspect as well the story was contrived and uninteresting the characters were plastic and unconvincing the manufactured suspense was nothing more than frustrating and annoying had there been any research done on the factual basis of this story there may have been some interesting thread but as any intelligent person who has even the slightest understanding of how technology or the internet works this movie is an obvious farce even with only the expectation of an average fictional techno-phobic type story i was disappointed by the lack of any real original content of all my experience of tom clancy's work this is the worst and most disappointing example i have ever encountered even on the larger scale this movie is one of the worst hopeless disgraceful and offensive efforts i have ever had the misfortune to witness and endure the worst 2 dollars i have ever spent
