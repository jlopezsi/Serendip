the days of our lives may not be the best soap on the air but it is certainly one of the most entertaining hours of television you can't take this show seriously because it's outrageous my family and i have watched this show for 20 plus years for the sheer enjoyment and entertainment value we knew john aniston before he was jennifer aniston's father as victor kiriakis we love frances reid as the beloved matriarch alice horton deirdre hall still looks great in her 50s you could dress her in rags and she'll still look great the cast has featured long term actors and actresses in roles we love we love these couples too of course you can't take anything on this show seriously but that's because we already take life too seriously the show has one of the strongest fan bases around if you want to argue just go look at the results of the soap opera digest awards days has swept those award ceremonies for years who cares if the story lines are ridiculous like marlena's possession and that she was the secret killer of so many beloved characters on the show ironically they all went to a secret island somewhere like lost long before that show came on the air i was just happy that they were alive somewhere that i didn't care about the logic of it we wanted them to be alive living somewhere the show will never be the classic like young and the restless has been over the years if you want fun you will watch days of our lives because regardless of the show's story lines which are outrageous the cast pulls it off better than any ensemble around nbc if you are reading soaps are a part of the american culture and should be around forever
