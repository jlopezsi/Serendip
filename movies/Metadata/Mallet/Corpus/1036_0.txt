here we are taken inside paul green's school of rock why are we taken in there i don't know the man himself is an obnoxious immature wannabe who stopped trying to be and who know finances his life on the money paid by parents who want their kids to be rock stars or to find a new outlet or learning environment this is no learning environment at least no in the traditional sense from what is shown all the viewer can gather is that those who are already gifted are given the best opportunities and those who struggle are left to struggle but as long as the money keeps coming in they can stay in the school to be shouted at and verbally abused the documentary maker really failed for me in that he really made no point at all and failed to really question or press paul green at all so we are guided through a time when some students are preparing for a frank zappa festival in germany we see toward the end that mr green has no problem taking limelight and applause at the festival's end but what had he really contributed frank zappa may have been revolutionary to some but his music is mostly aimless for me rather like this film i shall never watch it again ever
