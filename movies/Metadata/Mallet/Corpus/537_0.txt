one big damn mess i was duped into believing this to be a horror film but it is just a dumb mystery psycho-drama with plenty of bad acting predictable plot development and an absolutely absurd premise that hasn't got an iota of credibility or realism to it birch organizes a hole excursion so she can starve everyone to death in order to make a guy fall in love with her what a load of crap what's worse the entire british police force and its detectives and psychologists can't figure the mystery out and are deceived by a half-crazed teen who hasn't eaten or drank much for a fortnight can you spell dumb this whole teen horror/slasher/mystery genre just keeps digging down to new lows at least de palma's and hitchcock's nonsense can occasionally be entertaining whereas these kinds of films have no value whatsoever
