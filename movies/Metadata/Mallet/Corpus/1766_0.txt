ff8 is definitely one of the biggest classics in the series the story starts off with a group of students in a military school we have squall the main guy who is a loner and a bit moody there's zell who likes to use his fists for a lot of things selphie who is perky and always has a positiver attitude we also meet quistis their smart and incredibly hot instructor rinoa squall's love interest and irvine a ladies man along the way good points story the story is one of the best in the series and is mostly what i play the game for there are a few clever plot twists that will make the story even more interesting br br characters all the characters are likable enough except irvine maybe and they all have good interaction with each other br br setting the places are very nice to visit particularly the ones on the esthar continent esthar city a hi-tech metropolis tears point a place with statues and nice art and lunatic pandora find out for yourself summons the summons called gfs can be found in different circumstances some have to be fought some have to be drawn from enemies and some can only be obtained through special conditions and there are a number of secret ones as well br br bad points battles the system on this is a little slow paced and the drawing system just isn't that great development the junction system on this is a good idea junction gfs to use magic etc but it makes the characters too powerful and therefore makes most boss fights easy however you don't have to use the junction system as much so it doesn't really affect the game too much
