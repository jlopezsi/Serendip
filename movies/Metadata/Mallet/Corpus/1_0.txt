this is a very strange film that was long thought to be forgotten it's the story of two american army buddies william boyd aka hopalong cassidy and louis wolheim and their adventures as they manage to escape from a german prison camp during wwi however as this is a comedy the duo manage to make the most round about and stupid escape accidentally boarding a train to constantinople to be placed in a turkish prisoner of war camp on the way they manage to escape once again and end up in quite the adventure meeting sexy mary astor along the way br br as far as the film goes it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot it worked rather well the chemistry between boyd and wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining oddly however the film managed to beat out harold lloyd's film speedy for an oscar for best direction for a comedy a category no longer used as speedy was a superior film in most ways it's one of lloyd's best films still it's well worth a look especially if you love silent films br br by the way director milestone and louis walheim would team up just a few years later for another wwi picture the great all quiet on the western front a film that is definitely not a comedy
