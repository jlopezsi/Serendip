duane barry the limerick br br an ex fbi man duane barry<br br gets taken by aliens scary br br oh no not again br br i must make this end br br he takes hostages cuz he is weary br br duane barry has always been one of my favorite season 2 episodes i remember when i first bought the season 2 dvd set and watched the episodes in sequence before then i had never seen this episode and i hadn't realized just how early in the show scully's abduction had been br br the episode deals with an ex-fbi agent who has become an impulsive liar or something like that who is a repeat abductee he finally snaps and decides that in order to keep from being taken again he needs to get someone else to take his place and thus kidnaps his doctor and takes a travel agency hostage this is the first episode of a two-parter and this takes place mostly in the travel agency and plays out like your typical hostage crisis storyline with the task force talking to the killer and doing everything they can to get a shot on one end and the hostages and shooter on the other end i'm always reminded of the movie with samuel l jackson and kevin spacey i think its called the negotiator anyway mulder is called in to help talk to duane because of his special background and instead mulder ends up buying into duane's delusion which we will later find out was true duane is eventually shot and taken to a hospital where an implant is found and removed from his body scully takes the implant and scans it at the grocery store causing the register to flip out shaken she goes home and immediately calls mulder to relate the experience as she is in the middle of leaving a message duane barry shows up and kidnaps her and we are left with a to be continued the episode is entertaining and is an important part of the mythology there aren't exactly a lot of novel or singular moments that make it stand out other than the very unique character of duane barry but nevertheless i do enjoy watching it every time i will give it a 8 out of 10
