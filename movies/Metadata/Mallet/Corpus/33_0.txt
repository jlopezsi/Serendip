when the credits started for clockwatchers toni collette parker posey and lisa kudrow the senior citizens around me in the art house theater complained they hadn't heard of anybody there were also choice bit roles by james elliott of jag bob balaban and paul dooley and they didn't recognize them either there was a row of young kids in the front for some reason who talked as much as the seniors through the movie and kept going in and out to get food and slamming the door all of which is hard to take during a comedy br br this is a great movie for those of us in unsatisfactory office cubicle jobs ideal for those in temp hell not necessarily laugh out loud funny all the way through but biting social satire about office life today for those at the bottom end of a ladder that doesn't go anywhere br br collette's central character is almost too bland and vacant towards the end as there's no ringing conclusion just some small revenges but it's all in character and place br br kudrow gets to be a bit nastier and practical life-facing than her usual roles br br clearly the sister creators of this movie have spent some time as temps and temporary office placement companies are now the largest employers in the country br br originally written 5/26/1998
