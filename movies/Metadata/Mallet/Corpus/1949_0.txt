this film is about a man who is afraid of sharks he decides to work in a marina so he can put himself in as much danger as possible with other marine life br br one day a gigantic rubber shark decides to enter the park to see the sights and stuff brody junior realises this and spends the rest of the movie in the water br br anyway after all the nerve biting tension and thrills the shark is destroyed and they all live happily ever after in 3d br br it's strange how a film can claim to have three dimensions when every character in it only has one br br this trashy thrown together mess is an embarrassment to the series how far we have come from great dialogue great performances and iconic thrills to this piece of nondescript tosh br br then again it was directed by alan smithee's uncles cousins brother in law twice removed so the results were inevitable
