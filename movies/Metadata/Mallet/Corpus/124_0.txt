being that the only foreign films i usually like star a japanese person in a rubber suit who crushes little tiny buildings and tanks i had high hopes for this movie i thought that this was a movie that wouldn't put me to sleep wrong starts off with a bang okay now she's in training alright she's an assassin i'm still with you oh now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller zzzzz oh well back to gamera
