anne parillaud is phenomenal as a terrifyingly vulnerable beautiful and human young anti-hero with an incredible talent for violence a drug-addict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscience-less killing mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and machiavellian sadism nikita ventures on a roller-coaster ride leading a double-life as assassin and clean-living young woman in love her passionate affair with marco and the clarity of her un-drugged consciousness combine to promote the development of a conscience a dangerous thing in her line of work nikita is nevertheless a victim of her circumstances and like the rest of the characters on both sides seems stuck in a very bad situation in addition to the artistry with which this story is told this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and not-so-subtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder br br jean reno fans will enjoy his brief typecast cameo as the cleaner br br this is one of the best if not the best of besson's films it is extremely well paced starkly and beautifully shot and features some of the best acting and writing of the entire action genre the script is just a little better in french than english nikita does not have the feel of an action film but rather feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak and spiced with just a tad of hope parillaud's multi-layered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film
