this german movie is one of this boring serious german movies filmed year after year to burn money which is better used for good movies br br to forget this it begins at the loveparade in berlin with very very wild beats and a shaky very very modern camera a couple had sex somewhere get lost and the girl full of drugs is raped by the man who gets her out of the water of a fountain while she is sleeping some weeks later she realizes her pregnancy came back to berlin and in the chaos of boyfriend his friend the raper a drugdealer and her parents she searches for her way to future it's a terrible film in every scene the raper is full with conscious of guilt the poor guy no punishment only comprehension for his emotions
