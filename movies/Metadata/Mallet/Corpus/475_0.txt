lets start with the good the acting by beverly lynne was convincing and entertaining the lovely ms lynne has really stepped up her game and is showing real talent michael pare always seems to play the same type of character strong willed rebel ala streets of fire and eddie and the cruisers in this movie he plays a detective and he really goes through the motions but he is the best male actor in the vehicle charles durning must have lost a bet as he seemed comatose throughout the movie br br the bad the plot made no sense note to production company if you are going to mention a name like polycarp explain what you are talking about i cant give any spoilers here because the movie never came me a plot this movie is a waste of time and if not for the aforementioned beverly lynne this movie would have been a complete waste of time br br the ugly i will never get that 85 minutes of my life back so when i am in my death bed i will regret all the things i could have done other than watch megacrap but at least it will make me think of the beautiful beverly lynne and at least that will bring a smile br br bottom line this not a cult classic a blockbuster nor is it worthy of b-movie status it might be shown as a double feature with battlefield earth
