this film has a lot going for it it was done in vistavision a process that gave a superior quality to the film on the screen and unusually in black and white since most of the films in vistavision were in color the cinematography is great specially when it shows the wild horses being chased and captured it has three excellent performances by jack palance tony perkins and most of all by elaine aiken palance is a gunfighter who wants to change his lifestyle but knows that the odds are against it but he takes upon himself the mission of turning his revolted son tony perkins into a better person in this task he is helped by his former mistress elaine aiken with whom he wants no more involvement there is quite a sensual chemistry between aiken and perkins i wonder why such a talented good looking woman like aiken made so few films it is very hard for a normal father son relationship to develop between palance an perkins and director henry levin handles it very well making the film come to a very satisfactory ending
