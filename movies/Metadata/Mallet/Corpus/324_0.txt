ok this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than peter robocop weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told it's a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes br br what is on offer in screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun reasonable acting and a great story based on a phillip k dick short the main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped br br for sci-fi fans this is a must see for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10
