here we are xtro-3 the third in a series of almost totally unrelated films though this one has the same director as the second this time there's a new writer which is a very good thing the plot is miles better than xtro 2 but this still only ranks it as an average one the action is okay and the setting is okay the special effects are more believable than the second and much more effective in fact the whole film is made alot better and is quite effective with the plot of a team of soldiers sent to check out an island for the army only to find it's home to a very angry alien this borrows quite alot from predator but is done quite well as opposed to xtro 2's ripping off of the alien saga an okay action film but it never rises above being average and the ending is a bit stupid i give it 4 out of 10
