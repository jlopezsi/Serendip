i found this to be a very entertaining musical with some decent mixture of songs comedy and romance there are no less than three leading ladies and they all look good two of them are big names irene dunne and ginger rogers br br there's fred astaire in here too so i guess we can call this another astaire rogers film if so i think it's one of their best and certainly one of their most underrated you don't hear much about this movie and that's unfair br br rogers and astaire both have some funny lines in this film and i wish ginger's role had been bigger she and astaire do a couple of tap dance numbers that are excellent some of their best work together dunne's first two songs aren't bad but you have the rest her soprano voice almost broke my eardrums especially with smoke gets in your eyes br br randolph scott helen westley and claire dodd also star in this dated-but-generally fun movie
