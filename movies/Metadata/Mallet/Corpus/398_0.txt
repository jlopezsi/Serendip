my father and i were in disneyland 1 week prior to the grand opening of this ride at disneyland back in 1987 needless to say it is still on our list to catch when at the disney parks considering the technology at the time it came out it is still the foundation by which other sim rides attempt to duplicate it was a lot of fun and regardless of the dialogue it is just a good time
