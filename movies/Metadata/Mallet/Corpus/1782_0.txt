i remember waiting in line on may 25 1987 opening day when i was 14 years old eagerly anticipating this movie br br five minutes into the movie my heart sank this movie was the ultimate glossy high-powered empty comedy/action film even at age 14 i could tell this one stunk here were some of the reasons i felt this way br br 1 eddie murphy is bitter and angry throughout the movie there is no joy in this performance he's constantly yelling and screaming at everybody br br think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet he used his wit and intelligence to get himself through the gate in bvc ii he yells and insults everyone who dares to get in his way br br 2 when did axl become fishing buddies with ronny cox 3 the character billy rosewood becomes a gun nut for no real reason other than the writers thought it would be a funny direction to take the character br br this movie could have generated a simple laugh by having axl still driving around in his old blue chevy nova but no he's only shown driving a ferrari and bmw convertible
