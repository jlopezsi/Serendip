i watched this film with my father and it was truly a worthwhile experience the documentary is about a father and son who travel around the world and the development of their relationship as they talk with other fathers and sons in various countries this is a great movie to watch because everyone needs a father biological or not and one often loses sight of how important the influence of a father can be at times it will make you laugh at times it will make you cry and occasionally you will laugh and cry simultaneously it was just a great experience for me and my father to watch together
