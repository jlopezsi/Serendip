spoilers included not that it matters for such a horrible film though br br carnivorous robots in outer space that self-mutate and multiply underground before annihilating everyone on a forgotten planet in the future does it sound like the recipe for a real turkey well surprise surprise it is br br it's hard to even begin shredding this unwitting parody of a horror sci-fi maybe they should let some of those screamers do the job instead let them loose on the original reels good riddance and take the script too as you go if you can find one that is br br don't worry about the writers and producers this film was probably the result of some alien self-mutating process deep down some forgotten hollywood vault anyway oh help us if these films start self-multiplying as well br br ok peter weller is decent that's one star the rest hrm a clue don't waste money renting this film to find out br br if you're easily thrilled/scared by little lumps of unused screenplay crumpled up and dragged by string under a sand surface then this is for you br br if not you'll agree that the title screamers probably was inspired by the envisioning of hordes of horrified moviegoers stampeding out of theatres panicking at the thought of having spent any money on this crap now there's a sight that would probably have made a better horror movie but that's beside the point br br thank imdb that there is a site like this to warn other people about wasting parts of their precious lives on this garbage br br final grade epically bad
