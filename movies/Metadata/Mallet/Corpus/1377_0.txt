the eel does something so imaginative and effective in the way it tells its story it really makes the audience interact explaining this would ruin its effect a sort of thing rarely experienced anymore in filmgoing it's difficult to find movies that actually redirect your thinking and stimulate you and make you suffer in that great fulfilling way so i will leave you to take my word for it what is amazing about what the eel does is how it really enlightens the audience when it comes to the judgment and expectations of characters the eel probes meticulously and sneakily the strange progression of a person br br shohei imamura the film's cunning subtle and seemingly offbeat director fashions the opening murder with what is in the first nanosecond of reaction aggravating and promptly recognized as a brilliant little effect as the movie's main character stabs his cheating wife to death after slashing her frightened adulterous lover blood sprays all over the camera the scene becoming skewed and blurred through the bloodied lens forcing us naturally to want to peer around it to see as clearly as we can the violence the character continues to commit and at that point we realize as is imamura's intention that we are the audience and that there is the movie and that we are voyeurs who so badly anticipate such things as the passionately vindicating slaughter of a coldly adulterous lover and from there imamura exploits the weakness he knows we have but in what way cannot be predicted br br later in the film imamura stages a ballistic ungraceful fight that includes many characters but with a relentlessly stationary camera no matter how intricate certain actions get he refuses to let it be anything more than observed his intentions are all to make us conscious of what we are thinking as we watch these scenes it's a creative intelligence applied more and more rarely all the time br br the cast is very carefully balanced certain characters are animated some eccentric some very stoic and some are combinations of all three yet they never become even remote resemblances of clich√©s they are all meant to oppose or serve as comparison to each other in nature and chemistry br br another plus is the film's purposely awkward infectiously gawky musical score that like most music in japanese films is recurrent and sustained a repeated series of only a handful of melodies that are very memorable
