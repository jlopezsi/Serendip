we're here where's my videophone this movie is not as bad as some of the critics here say it is reasonably entertaining if you can get past the first 15 minutes it is tom clancy so there is some twists and turns to the plot which keeps it interesting i think it is best to compare it to some of the lamer james bond movies on that score it looks reasonably good br br what was going through my mind as i watched it was that i bet the computer security folks have watched the movie as a warning of what could happen sort of if they don't do their job and i bet some of the hackers watch it with dreams of glory br br obviously the problems with the internet described in the movie haven't happened for the most part so the movie looks a bit foolish actually i see from the book review that while the novel was written in 1999 it was set in 2010 but we have been learning in the past year or so about the dangers of spyware that abound in that sense the premise was remarkably prescient corporations just love to get their hands on all sorts of information about you without your knowledge and the government is not so different often they work hand in hand as in the airline passenger data collection so the movie as science fiction is not entirely far fetched br br i'm a fan of scott bakula and his great work on quanum leap frankly the tv show had better writing not to mention better cinematography and the critics who bemoan all the boilerplate about asschewing are right another point that bothers me especially given clancy's general penchant for veracity is the absurdity of they guy's wife covering him on the news no reputable news organization would allow this incest except perhaps fox br br but the ending is interesting enough to make it all worthwhile br br fans of ayn rand should find this movie especially interesting it follows the same theme as rand mcnally shrugged and the quality of writing is about equal br br who is steve day
