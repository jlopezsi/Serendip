not much to say about the man well not much positive but there's a really odd homo-erotic moment when the bad guy offers levy to check him for a body mic when the villain makes levy pat down his crotch he the villain gets this proud pleased look on his face like yeah i'm packing a big somethin somethin down there ain't i there are a few other smaller h.e moments too like when levy checks out jackson's back tattoo and is there some sort of subtext with all the talk about being shot in the butt br br the movie itself is poorly directed blandly photographed and the illegal-gun-running plot would be confusing if either the audience or the writer cared and sam jackson's i.a agent character was really unpleasant some of the time are we supposed to like him or at least think he's a good cop i dunno it's not funny to see him repeatedly beat on the informant with garbage can lids and phone books and hit him with his car again and again or the way he treats the local cops when they pull him over br br some big isolated laughs highlight levy's he's my bitch bit but it's less of a movie than an experiment to see how jackson and levy play off each other levy gets most of the laughs is it an inside joke or typecasting that he's in the dental field again after waiting for guffman but they ain't no riggs and murtaugh br br oh and would you believe the movie contains the most played-out scene in action movies the one wherein the cop's superior demands his gun and badge can this please be retired please since the movie looks really cheap i assume the producers got a bargain deal for it and others at the movie clich store like has anyone ever had their vehicle commandeered by a cop according to cop movies it happens all the time
