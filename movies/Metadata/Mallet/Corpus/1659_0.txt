utter rubbish really but it serves as one the rare appearances on celluloid in her tragically short young life look at her she's gorgeous poor dorothy gets kidnapped taken off to a school where she gets the cane for being naughty amongst other torments it's just nice to see her beauty now preserved for ever on dvd an all canadian affair appropriately enough since dottie was a canadienne shot in and around winnipeg the movie does feature a nice performance from jocelyn fournier as the sapphic headmistress with a penchant for smacking bottoms and assisting tara stratten in her bath but really it's just a movie made about and for dorothy she has a sweet voice with her canadian accent and great physical appeal made even more delightful since she was all natural and not enhanced like many of today's starlets thank you dorothy
