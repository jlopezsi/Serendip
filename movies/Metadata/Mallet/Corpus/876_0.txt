this film analyzes the creative impulse for advertising finds it in a asylum br br don't worry it is not a psychological study but a comedy the only problem is that i don't laugh often maybe with the taglines of the ads the performance of david hello paymer br br how much the leading actor dudley moore the endless casting of j.t walsh as a bad guy or a bad script i didn't see much insanity from the patients have to do with my dozing it's hard to tell br br in conclusion an average movie where the only flavors are its 80's spirit in america and hannah in a romantic character
