jittlov has more talent in his little finger than about 3/4ths of the film directing talent of hollywood combined the three little film bits he did for disney during the 1980s was the best thing that came out of the disney studio for that entire decade and the decade before but disney otherwise rejected his pitches for a feature film entirely br br jittlov's wizard of speed and time feature film is a wonderful romp of a film in spite of the fact that he was not allowed to finish the film's special effects and sound effects in many places as legend has it the film's co-producer richard kaye allegedly made off with the film's completion money before the film was done jittlov considers the film to be only about 75 completed which accounts for the less than stellar rating from some viewers who don't know of this behind-the-scenes back-story and who just don't get what jittlov was trying to do with this film br br it boggles the mind to think of how even more nifty the film would be is some financial angel would come along and give him the to complete it creating a director's cut for release on dvd with all his equally great short films available on the dvd as well as other extras that jittlov could add to the dvd also br br alas no one has been forthcoming and jittlov has suffered financially and emotionally for almost two decades when will hollywood learn to not destroy the creativity of such filmic geniuses as jittlov orson welles buster keaton etc etc etc etc join with me pound on the sand on the beach and shout damn them all to hell for not rushing to jittlov's aid br br jittlov can do with 5 million dollars what other filmmakers do with 50 million and with all the poorly conceived ineptly produced drek coming out on dvd and on tv the world needs filmmaker's with the talent vision(s and attitude of jittlov more desperately now than it ever did br br and on top of all that he treats his fans like gold returning phone calls i believe he's still in the l.a phone book and answering e-mails even his web sites are more magnificent than most also google can find them for you gawd is there no justice are all the studios in hollywood so consistently and perpetually stupid that they don't recognize his obvious talent has the world gone mad somebody with money call him
