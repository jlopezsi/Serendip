director irving pichel got so much out of orson welles and claudette colbert in this movie colbert's character is not only believable but strong yet vulnerable too i never figured orson welles would do well in a part like this but he exceeded very convincingly by pulling off one of his better roles this movie was the debut for richard long(19 and he was the right person for the role as claudette colbert's son natalie wood 8 plays a fine adopted daughter from europe with an austrian accent that is quite believable two things which really hold this movie together are irving pichel's excellent tight directing and max steiner's musical score pichel is an expert at timing drama and suspense during the final scene there is no possible way you will leave the screen max steiner always comes up with the right style for his movies and this movie is definitely a showcase for his sensitive score his use of strings and wind instruments are so well-placed at the right time and his music provides a thread which enhances the drama and keeps us on track
