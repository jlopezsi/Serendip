the black cat for all its flaws is one of the most unique horror films ever made its certainly the most bizarre horror film of the 30s outside of the legendary freaks plus it unites two of the greatest genre icons of all time boris karloff and bela lugosi its also one of the few occasions that edgar g ulmer was able to show how talented a filmmaker he was he only created one other notable film the absolute masterpiece detour which is possibly the greatest b-film ever made br br the main reason why the film works so well are the performances of both karloff and lugosi karloff plays one of his most deliciously evil yet charming and sophisticated characters yet the man exudes tension whenever he appears on camera even better surprisingly is lugosi lugosi was sometimes criticized as having charisma but no real acting skill he is actually superb in his role as a tragic hero this makes me wish he was given more parts such as this instead of the grade-c schlock he was confined to late on both of the stars have marvelous interplay especially the chess scene they more than make up for the sappy performances by david manners and julie bishop br br in addition to the performances ulmer must be given a lot of credit his direction and story are both bizarre and throughly captivating also the set design is quite surreal coming across as art deco gone horribly wrong its not a perfect film but is one of the most memorable horror films of the 30s 7/10
