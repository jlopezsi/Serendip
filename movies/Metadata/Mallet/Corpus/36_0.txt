i saw this on cable last night just 2 days after seeing the sprecher sisters latest film 13 conversations about one thing that was the reason i stayed up til 2:30 a.m to watch it in fact please read my review of 13 conversations posted yesterday this film is linear one scene following the other chronologically and therefore not as challenging to the viewer as 13 conversations but it does leave its mark as one character in the movie has been told to do br br writer/director jill sprecher is extremely adept in nailing down specifics and this gift for detail is in full evidence here the film is about fear lunch hours pettiness toilet paper loneliness rubber band balls despair paper clips friendship pencils desperation cocktail garnishes anger downright fury actually at being marginalized by the illusion of society and much more toni collette's face is still in my memory her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers and specifically seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear br br it's a small slice of life clockwatchers but it's an important slice one that anyone who has ever interacted with anyone on a daily money-driven basis can relate to if you've ever held a job i'm saying you will see yourself mirrored in at least some of these meticulous details
