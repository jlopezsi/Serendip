it puzzles me that people hates this movie so much it's a fun and enjoyable alien predator rip-off with no intentions of being a masterpiece look if you want to see predator go and see predator and not xtro iii it's as stupid as renting battle beyond the stars and expecting star wars br br anyway a group of marines is stranded on a remote island together with a mean and nasty 2-foot tall alien whose favourite pastime is dissecting humans the little sneaky alien has some kind of slime that he traps unknowingly b-actors in and he gets invisible as well br br ok it isn't much of a story but xtro iii has nice effects and is surprisingly gory at times
