i saw this when it came out in the theaters and it didn't work for me at all over the years i would catch a bit on t.v here and there and it would seem funnier than i remembered br br i took the tape out of the library and thought i would give it another try having been on a bit of a film noir jag i think i am going to rank it as a small classic perhaps as good as carl's old partner's best film young frankenstein admittedly you have to get on the frequency of extreme silliness that martin and reiner ask you accept without forcing things some of the gag's meander a bit like bogart's marlowe yet i somehow feel bogie's odd bemused non reaction to the mayhem is perfect he may fit into this movie better than beat the devil br br martin get's a chance to do some of his best ever physical comedy and hat's off to rachel ward who looks great and finds just the right tone for this somewhat odd acting assignment she can adjust my willie anytime
