i have an unnatural bias against this film first off paul green is one of the worst people that i have ever met and this documentary falsely glamorizes him as some sort of savior of rock roll wrong paul green is a failed musician who got a good idea in his head and even though i believe that his teaching methods should be classified as child abuse and should be thrown in prison the idea worked you may wonder why do i have such a strong hatred for the guy well here's a little back story br br i was a student at rock school for year when i was 13 and was the subject of much derision and psychological abuse from both other students and paul himself i only stayed for a year because i learned a lot of my guitar teacher nate and enjoyed playing with the other students who didn't hate me fast forward 4 years later after seeing this film and looking for work in the music business i got the chance to co-direct a show for the school and for all the hard work i put into that was methaphorically thrown under the bus by the institution br br as for the film i was definitely excited at first but after being back in the belly of the beast and being treated so horribly i curse this film and the subject br br however i certainly give all the props in the world to the kids who can stomach paul and his despicable actions and yet come out of it with a great talent and i do have the deepest respect for my peers from my time at rock school who have successfully developed their talents and gone on and become successful as for paul go f yourself
