i'm not a movie expert but i know when there's something to watch and something to just pass by and this movie here after reading the comments peaked my interest but once i got the movie playing it was a totally different thought 5 minutes in i had already made up my mind whether or not to continue watching this butcher of a movie it was extremely late here where i live so i decided to give it a shot but like i said above i could of let this one pass by about 40 minutes into it i couldn't watch anymore sad display of effects writing and poor acting couldn't of made this any worse to watch it was quite painful actually i cant be disappointed to much considering i spent money to watch this but i am disappointed that someone would say that this movie was worth watching on my list of movies that i have watched this one ranks a 1 time watch and no recommendation to any of my friends this was 40 minutes i will never get back so take it from me when facing the chance to watch something else vs this movie then take something else
