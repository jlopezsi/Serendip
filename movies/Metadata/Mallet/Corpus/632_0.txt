it was a good show idea and very funny but i didn't feel that suspense feeling i was hoping to get the commercials are too long and ill placed it takes away from the show if you can mop the kitchen floor during breaks but the show is a good idea and has humor which is something series like law and order don't have as much as so for its lack or suspense it makes up for in humor and uniqueness
