br br actually i believe that jezebel is a very different film animal from gone with the wind gwtw is a mega-epic with the whole civil war and reconstruction period as backdrops jezebel on the other hand plays out over a much shorter period of time historically i'm not even a big bette davis fan but i'll say that if jezebel doesn't convert you you can't be impressed all of the performances are excellently crafted and satisfyingly deep as would be expected from a stage play taken to the big screen i love gwtw but jezebel works as well or better at capturing the same basic period in us history while also keeping you waiting expectantly for the heroine's next outlandish maneuver william wyler was one of the great directors and his gift shines through in every scene i give jezebel 10/10 stars and davis more than deserved her oscar
