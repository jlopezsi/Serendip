still of the night is terribly underrated thriller from very good director robert benton.the ending is truly shocking and some sequences are very good central park and dream-like sequences it reminds me some of best hitchcock's films as rear window vertigo north by northwest or marnie.meryl streep and roy scheider are memorable performances.nestor almendros photography is very stylish and memorable especially in end parts of the movie.there are also some great lighting effects and complete lack of gore.music of john kander is highly suggestive and fit to the rest of the movie still of the night is one of better's thrillers 80s.highly recommended
