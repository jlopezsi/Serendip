this is great thanks to computer graphics and animations this movie appeared on tv just like every pokemon movies miramax films made this movie associated with kids wb or 4 kids entertainment but this time the distributors are walt disney pictures instead of kids wb this surprised me however but different distributors has different ideas on the movie that they'll make this is ab assumption but it could be a fact anyway it's great to see a movie with different distributors with different ideas once again thank you pokemon for creating your 7th movie i'm sorry that it's not as great as the 6th one which was my most favorite one but you'll do better i trust you besides every character has to play some role in every movies
