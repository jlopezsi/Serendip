not overwhelmingly bad yet nothing all too great about this one either br br long dull mundane prequel offering precious few scares looks like an average tv movie there's some atmosphere oozing from it but not that much overall has a strong amateurish feel to it as well a few scenes may make you jump the rest is all cold bleak stares accompanied by a silent soundtrack ohhh scary br br to avoid except for the snobby critics who'll find any foreign film interesting or to those that must see it for bragging rights it's basically 90 mns of people starring at one another with little else going on br br artificially slow dull pace doesn't make a film a masterpiece by any standards except for those with poor taste i'd recommended suicide circle or cure way better than this view it if you really have nothing better to do 5/10
