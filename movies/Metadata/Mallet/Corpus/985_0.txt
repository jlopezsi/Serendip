one of my favorite films of all-time unusual because the pirates depicted in this movie are all too real none of the romanticizing errol flynn or jack sparrow stuff these pirates were shockingly ruthless and a real sense of danger permeates the film yul brynner and kirk douglas bring intensity to their roles brynner as the egotistic sociopath who is the leader of the cutthroats and douglas as a man who must deal with a desperate situation in a fight for survival samantha eggar as a woman with flawed instincts for her own preservation evokes frustration and pity from the brutal opening scenes the message is clear that these pirates don't play a sense of urgency then takes over until the final outcome a great movie
