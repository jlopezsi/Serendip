watching this film was like reliving the jobs i had in my 20's waiting for 5 o'clock looking busy trying to impress people who didn't give two hoots about you and the dreams ah the dreams br br this is a very believable study of working life for the bottom rung female how they band together then fall apart it's ultimately a sad story with some hope for 2 of the characters but it's as close to life as it gets br br wonderful performances by all 4 actresses and small roles by some big character actors make this a good film
