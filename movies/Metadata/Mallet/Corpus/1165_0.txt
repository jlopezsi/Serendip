i was really impressed by the book of caleb the first low-budget indie for the young director matt manahan the scale is huge lots of locations costumes and characters and it looked amazing how many first features shoot in 35mm these days i had just gotten together with my friends from high school a few days before watching the film and so the themes hit me and resonated i have so many old friends who i keep in touch with and miss yet when we're together it's obvious how different we all are now one friend said i feel just like i did when i was 21 and i had to say back why would you want to do that you're 32 i think that's something we all go through and continue to caleb captured it well i also loved seeing bucks county my home town on the big screen br br for the most part i thought the balance of humor and pathos worked really well there was one scene that i thought stuck out but i can't remember what it was it may have been the transition into the speech in the school yard or when the guy is dancing on the roof br br the film struck me as a great mix between a parable and 80's coming of age films the voice-over sets that tone well although i did wonder if it could be shorter i have no idea
