i actually saw this movie when it first came out when i was just eleven years old little did i know i was only one of a few people who would actually admit to viewing it i have been looking for a chance to review it for many years br br at the time i thought this movie was pure science fiction but it turns out that cgi and animation are actually replacing live actors beginning with max headroom a few year later to me this movie was ahead of its time a bit of 1984 meets james bond br br not that it was such a great acting movie it stars albert finney but i give it a little extra because of the interesting story and eerie foretelling the directing and overall technical aspects gives this movie most of its accolades br br given the dated material and the talent this one has dissolved into an 80s b-movie would like to see it again for nostalgia's sake though
