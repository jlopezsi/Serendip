i just have watched this film and i must say i didn't like it ok the idea behind it is good but that is not enough the film hardly shows nightmare of the camps i was in auschwitz in majdanek in treblinka for me it seems like director have never seen any of them and only heard about br br the film also simplifies everything there is no background we know nothing about situation someone told before that during ww2 6 million jews died yes that is true but during this war also 6 million poles died and what is important half of the killed jews were poles which means that half of the killed poles were jews i personally know people who survived war in poland in their tales almost nothing is black or white everything is gray sometimes jews killed jews while poles risking their lives helped jews but sometimes poles killed jews while german officers helped jews these were dark times and this film doesn't show the tragedy of the second world war or the holocaust br br the film hasn't moved me i was not far from turning my computer off before the end of the film i think that we can't understand what it was like in the camps i believe though that film as part of mass-media has tools to show everyone that it was so terrible that it's not understandable for us this film didn't make use of this tools
