after seeing point of no return a great movie and being told that the original was better i was certainly thrilled to see that one of the indie film channels was running la femme nikita then i saw the movie ouch this was a major let-down br br nikita herself reminds me of jar jar binks more than any other character i've seen recently she comes across entirely as comic relief the movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin and that concept failed miserably in nikita due to the poor writing of the title role
