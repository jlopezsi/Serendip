i came upon 1 giant leap after looking up what films that ram dass has appeared in i love the way the passion for creativity shows up in the swirl of colors images music poetry and love of human diversity that this dvd projects i rated it a 10 for that and its energy some have criticized it because of slow parts i liked the balance of very energetic parts versus the time taken to contemplate the beauty and peace that surrounds us i would have liked even more diversity to be included amer-indian caribbean chinese arabic indonesian japanese finnish north african etc that said this is one dvd that can be watched time and again i would rate this a must see if you have an interest in spiritual side of existence i would recommend seeing fierce grace with ram dass
