contrary to popular opinion this is not a sequel it is supposed to be a tribute to the original people who bash this movie without reading aykroyd's interviews are ignorant to the intent here this movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before belushi died when that happened the idea for another adventure fell away but after almost two decades aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and co-star belushi so he assembled this concert movie which is supposed to be all about the music not the story the only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring even if you really like the performer(s so here it is for the true blues brothers fans to enjoy p.s and if your problem with the plot was some of the cartoony style actions that occur cabel being pulled heavenward and his clothes magically changing et cetera remember that the original had the same things in the first one the entire band's clothing magically changes for a concert but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change then the film works much better the same idea works for the much-maligned zombie sequence near the end at queen mousette's mansion also people complain about the bluesmobile in this film being able to drive underwater well in the first film the car flew performed flips and was nearly indestructible in fact if you watch the dvd of the first film you find in the deleted scenes and making-of section that the bluesmobile is supposed to be magic because it was parked each night inside a power transformer how is that for cheesiness on the first film so that also explains elwood's ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loop-de-loop at the fairgrounds even though i wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original i do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating perhaps this film has a little more depth than people expect so they incorrectly perceive it to be a lackluster and shallow mindnumbing entertainment i know better remove the stars in the address to e-mail me
