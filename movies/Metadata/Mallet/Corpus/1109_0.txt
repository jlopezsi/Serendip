what you didn't know about senator george mcgovern and presidential candidate george mcgovern is captured by director stephen vittoria in this documentary which should be required viewing by all who care about our country and our election process but it's far more it's the story of how a distinguished professor of history with all the values and integrity that we would like to attribute to those who enter politics and determine much of our destiny sacrifices a secure and magnificent life with his family for that which might make our country safer more respected and less corrupt he does this because he believes it can be done to save the lives of those young americans dying needlessly in an unjustifiable war in vietnam and he does it so that he and his family and all americans can have real hope for the future that's what we wanted then that's what we hoped for in our leaders then and that's oddly what we still want so desperately in this perilous world now there are moments in the film that remind us of things you will recall or be fascinated to know because you didn't really know the truth then some of what you had thought which you will see was totally false you'll not only learn of the frailty of our democracy due to television election time commercial spots but with 20-20 hindsite you'll see how we the american voters were tricked the comic genius of political observation dick gregory and so many magificant observers of history in the film provide intelligent even humorous observations about our lives and our system of government it really doesn't matter what side you're on considering where we find ourselves today where our nation's young soldiers men and women are fighting in iraq the film tells us bluntly that we have not really learned or grown or done much about our historic blunders it's shocking in the time of george mcgovern's presidential bid against president nixon who would later resign in disgrace lest he be impeached and thrown out of office we had a choice we could correct the mistakes of how we go into war in vietnam under two administrations johnson and nixon in which lost us 60,000 americans and wounded so many more or we could stay the course as we do today this extraordinary look into our past is like a roadmap to the future it demonstrates how the nature of american politics does not change nomatter how obvious the truth is particularly delivered by a 500-1 shot as was mcgovern senator mcgovern for over a decade had opposed our involvement in the war in vietnam and pledged above all that if elected he would bring our troops home and end the senseless deaths of our young and brave men and women fighting soldiers this film is a tribute to a man a former fighter pilot 35 missions in wwii a respected senator from south dakota and candidate for the presidency smear tactics from nixon's party's creep that will shock you and amaze you and even the strange occurrences related to the attempted assassination of george wallace will make your jaw drop but through it all senator mcgovern had hope and gave the working people hope the poor and isolated people hope where none had existed since the days of president kennedy robert kennedy and rev martin luther king jr you'll see images and hear words of that time when it was marvelous to have someone with the courage and you'll see the power of a political machine that constantly tried to crush him i ask you to find this film order it online in dvd when it's out read the interview in venice magazine written by alex simon and published by nancy bishop this is so important to all of us if we are ever to have hope again about our nation and our leaders and it's as appropriate now because we are again locked in a front page war that was so similar don't rob yourself of this great film about one great man who would have made a difference in this nation's course there aren't many but it gives us a slim sense of hope that there might be someone to renew our hope again and make american all that we want it to be and make us safe
