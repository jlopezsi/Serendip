before john candy was really famous he starred in this rather silly canadian movie about a series of kidnappings he plays police officer kopek investigating the kidnappings and getting into a bunch of loopy situations along the way the only other cast member whom i recognized was mickey rooney playing a trigger-happy hit-man named trigger although apparently peter cook also starred br br overall find the lady is nothing special mostly a series of gags but it's pretty fun especially the end scene i guess that you could say that it backs up what michael moore always says canada is the greatest place on earth
