david manners and julie bishop billed as jacqueline wells play two newlyweds on vacation in hungary who make the acquaintance of genial doctor vitus verdegast bela lugosi after an accident on the road they end up accompanying dr verdegast to the mansion of hjalmar poelzig boris karloff an architect with more than one secret to hide br br the black cat is apparently based none too closely on the edgar allan poe poem but has its own story just using the poem for inspiration the plot isn't much to speak of with many of the revelations spoken by verdegast in fact it's such an economical light-on-story little movie directed capably by b-movie veteran edgar g ulmer that it flies by and is over in just over an hour br br it's quite a departure from the gothic nightmares that were a number of the classic universal chillers set in the present a palpable feeling of what-the-heck-is-going-on mystery hangs over the proceedings underscored by a nicely melodramatic music score interesting sets are also a bonus as well as a climax involving a satanic mass and a torturous comeuppance for karloff br br however this is really all about seeing karloff and lugosi act together karloff is a marvel of cagey subtle villainy and lugosi pretty likable in a rare good guy part the other actors pretty much hold their own against the two leads but it's really karloffs and lugosis show br br i was struck by the great character faces of supporting actors egon brecher and harry cording and the beauty of lucille lund all of which enhanced my enjoyment of the film br br it's a fun little picture and good for a nights viewing br br 8/10
