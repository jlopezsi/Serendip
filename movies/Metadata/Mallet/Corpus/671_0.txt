i was really disappointed by this film having seen julian sands name on the box i thought ok well he's been in some pretty bad films arachnophobia boxing helena etc but he's also been good in things so i'll give it a go plus it was screened at last year's frightfest which is usually a guide to a film's quality having a spanish director also sounded good given that it was set in spain br br but whilst the setting costumes etc were all amazing and the script was pretty good the actors really let it down particularly mr sands the lead actress and the professor i couldn't take any of his scenes seriously probably worth seeing if you haven't got anything better to do but don't expect a masterpiece or quality acting with the exception of antonio who was well worth the cost of rental
