there were some interesting made-for-television feature length films in the early 1970s and a cold night's death is among the best of the lot the remote arctic setting the feeling of isolation and gradually mounting nervous tension between the two main characters are all superbly handled the quiet loner robert culp and the nervously edgy eli wallach are perfect foils for each other and their byplay heightens the creepy something lurking nearby feeling prevalent for most of the film maybe just maybe some viewers will guess what's really going on midway into the film but even so it is a brilliantly chilling movie worthy of any collection
