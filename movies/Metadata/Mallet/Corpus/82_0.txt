here's a an idea let's round-up a bunch of hollywood has-beens second rate tv actors and a bunch of no-names and put them all on board a cross atlantic flight and let's add a crazed mechanic with a grudge oh and how about adding a deadly virus that fills the plane you've got the recipe for a 1970s tv movie-of-the-week br br how many of these doomed airplane movies did they make if you believed what you saw at the movies and on television planes were dropping out of the skies like flies in the 70s these kinds of movies were all the rage and sst death flight was meant to grab onto the disaster-cycle coattails i'll give the movie credit though it's actually not much worse than most of the rest of its ilk the acting is what you would expect from the likes of lorne greene tina louise and bert convy the manufactured tension comes across 30 years later as more humorous than anything else the characters are cardboard cutouts with overly dramatized problems that can miraculously be solved in an hour or so the one thing sst death flight has going for it is a slightly unusual twist at the end where the characters the choice of life or death other than that it's cookie-cutter 70s disaster film-making at it's best or worst depending on how you look at this stuff
