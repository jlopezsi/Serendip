this movie makes some odd choices on the one hand it's a good looking and also clearly professionally made movie with lots of talent involved but it just makes some wrong choices in its storytelling br br the movie obviously starts of as a dramatic based on true events movie but soon as the movie starts to progresses it starts taking some obvious hollywood turns with its emotions and action and the story becomes more unlikely and clich√©d of course nothing wrong with this since it definitely makes the movie an entertaining and bit of adventurous one but in this case the approach doesn't really work out since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it you know the kind of message to save the rain forest it also uses lots of technology vs nature elements i'll admit that this movie is a better attempt than all steven seagal attempts combined but no that doesn't mean that this movie is a perfect or truly successful attempt on its own the movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one though the right intentions are definitely there i mean for instance the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all br br the natives scenes also aren't always among the best or most interesting one's out of the movie sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part the entire movie doesn't always feel like one whole the parts of it are all too disjointed br br it nevertheless it is a rather good and also entertaining enough movie to watch despite its obvious flaws and bad choices in the storytelling and hey it's got powers booth br br 7/10
