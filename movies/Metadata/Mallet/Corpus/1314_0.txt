tekkon kinkreet is the most stunning visual anime that i seen since akira director arias use of colors and directing style is nothing short of genius the best part of this movie is its heart felt story between the two brothers black and white black is the older more responsible brother who is tough and violent while white is the younger off beat childish brother black and white watch over the city they live in called treasure city in a gang called the cats but it's the duality of the orphaned brothers that makes this story so touching the tough older brother black needs his young brother white to remind him of his humanity and white needs his brother to help protect him br br as the two brothers protect treasure city the evil developer snake moves in to take over as he vows to kill black and white the brothers bonds are tested black is faced with his dark inner demons of hatred and violence and white must bring him back br br there are no giant robots in tekkon kinkreet or magic although the brothers black and white seem to be able to fly on and off rooftops it seems to be the limit of any type of super powers this anime is amazing purely for its story and visual look if you are a fan of anime or cartoons rent this movie you will not be disappointed
