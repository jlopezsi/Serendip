for some reason i'd been resisting seeing this film until a friend thrust it into my hands and said c'mon toni collette and parker posey how can you go wrong br br maybe i was resisting because i didn't want to see my life up there on the screen currently working in a temp job where i am typing this review clockwatchers is terrifyingly familiar it's not a hilarious comedy although it is quite funny certain moments threaten to veer into david lynch-style self-conscious surrealism but the director reigns these moments in in the nick of time br br it's a film about small things happening in an enclosed space and the friendships that grow between the most unlikely of people due mostly to proximity the mood of paranoia that emerges in the second half of the film is perfect turning trivialities into monumental acts of anarchy and betrayal the office becomes a sealed microcosm where the theft of a tiny plastic monkey becomes the end of the world br br not everyone is going to understand this film it's not office space which is more accessibly wacky you're not going to chuck it on with your mates and have a good laugh it's much more sombre and serious and ultimately quite sad and it's made me quit my job so perhaps i should have given it 10 stars just for that
