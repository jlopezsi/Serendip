burnt money a provocative severe crime thriller from argentina begins like a spanish language guy ritchie narrative with an assembly of criminals arranging a heist yet the heist is over in a glance the lion's share of the story is the impact of the job so much of this film seems already acquainted from its appealing crime thriller stylization to its narrative echoes of reservoir dogs heat and bonnie and clyde that when it takes one of its unprecedented turns it overcomes you there are a lot of unforeseen detours br br the opening introduces us to angel and nene gay lovers who live in a murky buenos aires apartment a narrator notifies us that they are known as the twins after showing how they met in a grungy public restroom the narrator distinguishes the one telling way they are similar the still eyes the lost glare the knifelike center on character relationships and the novelistic way the story is divulged through sequential narrators featuring internal monologue prepares us to pull back to enmesh the twins in the heist neither they nor the story are as they appear br br leonardo sbaraglia plays nene with scorched vigor he has the loose-hipped walk of a younger robert downey jr yet oozing even more with suggestiveness his underhanded approach to life is not smug or justified but rather self-assuredly devoid of any overeagerness or vanity eduardo noriega brings a preyed-upon sentimentality to angel we feel at first as if he may be slow and perhaps to some extent he is but in a way that is lost in emotionally charged internalized delusions a return to the primordial dilemma he seems afloat in dissolution a dream state readily seen and their emotional holding out becomes a game that neither wins where they are intimate there is peace restored and there are religious obstacles br br the robbery of an armored car goes awry the thieves one of them injured must stay completely out of sight law-sided demoralization and violence are initial drives of the story's turning point though not at the center the film which is based on a true story offhandedly concedes that the lines separating cops from robbers are obscured but its focus remains tight on the robbers br br one should not write this film off as categorized for a gay target audience though it revolves around the two implicitly loving leads burnt money seems to compete with much more vivid heterosexual pairings nene swings both ways and cuervo the getaway driver played by pablo escharri has a girlfriend who figures integrally in the plot after the men flee to uruguay police beatings push the left-behind girlfriend to give them up their status revealed the robbers must stay out of sight pressures mounting anti-gay implications add to the enmity they don't trust each other everyone keeps a gun at hand but attachments gradually solidify nonetheless br br burnt money could have almost been made in the 1970s when a film with the promise of spectacle in its subject matter was almost expected to take the more complex way to the end no matter what the end may be and yet the film reaches a climax we've seen so many times nevertheless even in its brutal execution which extrinsically offers not much in the way of variation on a device dating back to the original 1932 scarface it maintains a theme of dissolution a dream state made real to them of feelings taking over a theme which in the end makes the film its own beast
