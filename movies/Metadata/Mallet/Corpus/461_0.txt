we just saw the movie by accident we went to the theater to see bi2 and saw that swimmers was playing we had the thrill of meeting doug sadler writer director and robert knott since we live across the chesapeake bay from the eastern shore where the movie is set we are familiar with the area the lifestyles the economics and such swimmers captures the intensity of the chesapeake bay watermen in the declining estuary and the rhythm and flow of the water and the people that make their living on it i was immediately sucked into the intensity of the movie and the innerness of the people the acting is so good and the filming timing sights and sounds are so well done that i forget i was watching a movie and felt that i was sitting next to over looking over the shoulder of the person actor in the scene the subject is intense and the plot is the personalities of the family members their thoughts and their interactions it's a movie that will peel back the onion of your memories and deep personal feelings it's definitely not a feel good movie it's much more a feel what is very real about you and people you are closest to movie
