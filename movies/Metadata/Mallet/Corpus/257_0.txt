since i haven't seen the classic that came before this i'm unable to compare it or be biased by it br br robin williams movies are always a pleasure to see but the over the top script for this one is hysterical i'd imagine one has to be somewhat open minded to enjoy it having many gay friends and having gone to many a party thrown by them i can see it all taking place and the drama caused by a very feminine man playing a very straight woman in order to avoid coming out of the closet is too funny that dinner scene is an absolute riot br br the sad thing about it is knowing that so many have to hide their sexuality for fear of being ostracized but this puts such a humorous spin on things it must have been a really fun movie to produce and/or act in rent it when you are in need of a laugh
