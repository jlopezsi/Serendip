despite the summary above this film actually does have some saving graces 3 of them well if you're a young male that is br br it's not worth talking about the plot of this film there isn't one it's not worth talking about the acting there isn't any not even from robert englund who frankly ought to know better br br however young men take note there are 3 pairs of deliciously natural-looking breasts on display at various points in the film all totally unnecessary for the furtherance of the non-existant plot but nice to see anyway br br oddly enough if you're willing to ignore 1h29m of drivel the final twist at the end actually bears a semblance of originality also watching jerry trimble apeing kurt russell albeit badly is a hoot br br if this film could be awarded zero stars frankly that'd be all it deserved one star is way to generous but as that's the minimum i can give it that's what it's got
