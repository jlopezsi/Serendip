for those of you that stole or borrowed your parent's national geographics for whatever purpose this is the film for you you would be hard pressed to find any better looking native girls going around topless and mostly bottomless anywhere and they actually hate wearing western style clothes great scene there br br this movie is mostly a tarzan adventure about a boy lost in the amazon(no plug intended rain forest that was brought up by natives instead of apes lots of nostalgia about a way of life that has been lost because of ecological destruction caused by man's progress usually such proselytizing would make for a pretty boring movie but boorman keeps the action lively with cannibals naked native women forced prostitution gunfights knifefights spearfights and the like br br national geographic was never like this
