i've seen the movie at the malaga festival spain it's one of the best gothic stories of all times it's a peculiar mixture between the silent of the lambs and sleepy hollow or from hell it's more than a normal horror werewolf movie much more it's a story where gothic meets romance where horror meets love where documentary meets fairytale yes cause this is a true story manuel blanco romasanta is one of the most intriguing serial killers of all times he was judged in spain in 1852 having confessed the killing of at least 13 people he dared proclaim his innocence he was not guilty because he was a werewolf the thing i liked most is the way the authors introduce us in a real fairytale i don't find other words to describe this story it's fantasy and reality at the same time it's like to be at the same time in a chapter of csi and in the tale of red riding hood we experience this adventure from the point of view of barbara the woman who falls in love with manuel romasanta and who progressively changes her love into rage the arc of the character is so well developed that the identification with her is complete we do feel the same love and the same hatred that barbara felt towards manuel another strong point of the movie is the cast and moreover the female roles the actresses who play barbara and her sister maria are superb i really enjoyed the way they expressed their arena finally last but not least i do suggest to keep an eye on this young director paco plaza believe me he's a true genius
