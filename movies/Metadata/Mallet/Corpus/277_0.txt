the birdcage is the hysterically entertaining americanized version of the french classic la cage aux folles in this version robin williams plays the gay owner of a florida nightclub who learns his straight son dan futterman is coming home and is engaged to be married williams learns from his son that his fianc√©e's parents gene hackman dianne wiest are straight-laced and ultra-conservative and will not be comfortable meeting his gay father or his even more flamboyant lover nathan lane and suggests williams send lane out of town while hackman and wiest are in town instead lane puts on his best drag and meets the parents as williams wife in one of the most hilarious dinner party scenes ever filmed this film is chock full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances i also found it rather refreshing to see robin williams playing straight man to lane who along with hank azaria as their housekeeper practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's and the sight of gene hackman in drag is something everyone must experience
