the birdcage is a hilarious movie about a happily married gay couple forced to play straight for the marriage for armond's son and his conservative in-laws even though it is a bit stereotypical it was played with charm and energy and is absolutely irresistible i really enjoyed the birdcage because it had a lot of serious issues yet managed to turn into a fun joke we take the politic stand on gay marriages so seriously that i think this was needed just for a good laugh at it br br nathan lane and robin williams what terrific performances again i know it was stereotypical but i have a couple friends that do actually act like that so i was more than willing to go with it i loved the whole nathan being the mom dinner scene it was just too hard not to laugh i am little surprised by the rating of 6.5 i think people should see this film and just have a good time with it trust me it's just a fun movie and it's not offensive in any way br br 10/10
