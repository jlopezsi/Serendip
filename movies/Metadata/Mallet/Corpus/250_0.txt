amazingly perceptive i think the director must have peeked into the lives of so many of my single friends of any age he's captured their sense of lossnot so much lack of sex as the absence of companionship just loneliness pure and simple and as shown here it's the lengths people go to reach out to others that makes last call so poignant and unforgettable br br insightful as it is i also found the film's bittersweet realism a bit unsettling at timeslike watching a sneak preview of sex in the city-30 years later in less-skilled hands this might have been a snide sitcom or soppy soap it's not at all from yet another perspective its surprisingly surreal elements both in direction and camera work lift it into that rarefied ozone layer of a classic art film in english but with a gallic sensibility br br despite the short length last call achieves what standard features rarely accomplish in over twice the running time i was tremendously moved you will be too
