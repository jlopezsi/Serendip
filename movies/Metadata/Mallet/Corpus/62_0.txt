i finally saw this on tv several years ago and wish i had taped it it's got strong story elements that could have been developed into something really great br br the idea of a funeral to be held at night because the deceased the daughter of a very wealthy man had been blind sets the tone add a race against time to save a kidnapping victim who's been buried alive and you've got the elements of a tidy thriller br br my understanding is that the novel this was based on the concrete garden if i remember the title correctly was actually written by several mystery writers it was a project where writer a came up with the concept and wrote opening then passed it to writer b who developed it and threw in complications that would make writer c sweat bullets to resolve the fact that there were so many writers involved seems to have made it very difficult to get the rights to the story and that's why it's the only one of william castle's thrillers not available on video br br we've seen remakes of several of castle's works maybe someone will discover this one and get the rights issue resolved
