i like the relation ship between de main characters is a way to show love<br br between two people in this case men is a hard love story but very human very sensitive you can feel pain the actors are terrific did they win an award because they deserved one i didn't like the voice over at the beginning we don't need it<br br the soundtrack is very smart i loved the moment when the nene speaks the<br br voice over and we can hear billy holiday good direction good art thank you
