the premise of this movie is simple and hilarious moore play an advertising executive who experiences a minor nervous breakdown unlike reginald perrin who fakes his suicide moore's character has a falling-out with deceit he begins composing advertisements that tell the truth br br and this is where the comedy really takes off moore's character is confined to an institution but in the meantime his spoof adverts are accidentally sent to press as things turn out the truth has more appeal than lies why do ad-men and politicians find that so hard to accept in the asylum the plot enters its second phase as we are introduced to a bunch of people with all manner of comic and tragic conditions it is they who take up the thread of humour in this part br br it is also here that things go awry a romantic sub-plot is farcically attempted by the introduction of darly hannah as a love interest for moore like him she has also been committed for some reason br br the story then struggles between these two digressing strands and the whole plot is stretched too thin to cover them dudley moore was 55 by the time he worked this movie and much too old to play a romantic lead with a 20-something inmate their relationship begins to look uncomfortably like abuse darly hannah has a wonderful face and figure but not much else her coy-and-vulnerable-beauty is a role she would reprise to the letter in splash with tom hanks br br there is a happy ending as you would expect but by then so many wheels have come off that you no longer take the joke seriously any more it's a pity john guilgud wasn't used instead of ms hannah he could have been an insane politician turned philosophical mentor or some such thing the plot would have stayed on-track and the gags could have kept on coming the pairing had already been shown to be a winning formula in arthur bob hope and bing crosby demonstrated that such a franchise could work in the longer-term with their road to series br br for the most part this is well worth a watch just be ready to make some coffee or get a beer or something when the maudlin and implausible romance takes over unless you're a fan of ms hannah's physical charms that is br br this was pretty well dudley moore's last hollywood outing if he'd been 20 years younger i think he would have made the ideal candidate for splash but the studios needed a younger vulnerable-funny-guy and tom hanks seems to have been moore's natural successor he wasn't as funny but he wasn't so short and had youth on his side he was also a yank br br if you think this is good then try bedazzled you'll see cuddly dudley both at his most endearing and at the high point of his pairing with peter cook
