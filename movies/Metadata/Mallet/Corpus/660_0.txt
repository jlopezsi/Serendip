first off i must say that this is a fun game show also i haven't if i've seen every episode however i do know the show fairly well every time i've watched it i've had a lot of fun playing along and watch the thing i like most about it are the questions despite the fact that i don't know that many answers i still have fun playing along i hope the game show network keeps it on so i can play along and watch again if that happens i will be really happy before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever now in conclusion i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
