world war ii movies are my forte and i am well-versed in military history as well as time-period accouterments i have seen some bad second world war flicks in my time but this thing of a picture this blasphemous abomination sure cuts the cake besides lacking talent creativity and a determination for a little historical research the guy who directed this film had to have sympathies with nazi ideals first it was shocking to see the french resistance portrayed as a roguish band of buffoons headed by an equally idiotic and boisterous leader a smack in the face to the brave witty maquis who courageously resisted the german occupation of their homeland secondly,the film is saturated with bad acting senseless dialog contemporary uniforms,weaponry and vehicles check out the u.s troops wearing spanish army camouflage uniforms helmets which are a direct copy of the old german m1944 poorly concealed by helmet covers and brandishing cetmes spanish copies of the g3 7.62mm automatic rifles the tiger is clearly a spanish army-issue m-48 need i go on rent but do not buy this movie the insatiable stupidity will make you laugh and cry and laugh again yes it's that bad
