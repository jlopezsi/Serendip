quiet thriller with great acting from meryl streep taken a slightly different route with the paranoid performance from roy schnieder unfortunately some other of the other performances are quite poor with the standard dumbed down cops slow to pick up it's worth sticking with past the stock plot setup routines there's some neat camera work to strengthen the guessing game and make you feel the paranoia and fear of the doctor there's a fantastic sequence in central park where the doctor follows a mystery woman losing her beneath the light dark pools of street lights using the sound of her footsteps to pull your attention forward to a tunnel the final moments of that sequence are brilliant throughout the lighting is used to great effect with all other senses and even performances extremely restrained a good film which i'm sure has influenced many others of this genre
