what could be so frightening and irrational that a scientist would choose to freeze to death rather than confront it you'll find out br br while we think of scientists as being unflinching heroic seekers of truth they can be pretty nutty people in denial of reality it's true the movie is about two different types of scientists who are trying to complete some research involving monkeys in a remote freezing mountain environment the experiment was left uncompleted by the death of a scientist who seems to have gone insane and died freezing to death regardless of the fact that the audience can more-or-less figure out who the culprit is the last 30 seconds are incredibly chilling to see imagine characters debating if a shark was involved in the deaths in jaws but only in the last minute of film you finally see a fin circling the hero or a ventriloquist who insists his dummy is alive and at the end you see it move worth watching in the dark for the very creepy climax br br kudos for the director's long-takes and gil andromeda strain melle's unsettling score
