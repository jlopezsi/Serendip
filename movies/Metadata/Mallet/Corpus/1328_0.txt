vengo is a call a song a hymn to life to love to mourning to blood money a hymn to the mediterranean spirit tony gatlif br br well with this been said i don't think i have very much more to add it's everything what the director said i never really liked musical movies i am like most people and i must admit that as well as me others missed out on great movies br br i have worked for a long time in a video store and i saw that many musical movies were put aside it doesn't mean that musicals are by definition good but it's like our system block them automatically away and we won't watch them why i don't know because of our childhood does our body protest thanks to movies like sound of music and mary poppins and etc br br could be even dancer in the dark didn't do well in the video store from an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by lars von trier br br but those who did see it thought it was great well it is the same with this movie those who saw it thought it was great those who heard people sang in it didn't even bother to turn their back and try out on something they always rejected and therefore missed something i really liked vengo and i enjoyed the music allot and i didn't regret it for a second
