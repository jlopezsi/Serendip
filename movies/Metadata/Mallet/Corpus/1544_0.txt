i was eight years old when i first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942 it was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after today i still enjoy the film for its beautiful color photography exciting sea scenes and fine performances from ray milland and john wayne wayne is unjustly accused of causing his ship to sink for profit the story unfolds as he tries to clear his name paulette goddard provides the love interest the film never drags,whether on land or at sea where some of the most exciting action takes place.the underwater scenes,especially the finale are memorable supporting cast score and special effects are all top notch.demille directs in his usual showman style a fine effort from all concerned
