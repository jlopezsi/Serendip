this 1997 movie is meant to be a comedy but after about an hour i switched it off as if there was anything remotely amusing i did not see it br br the story spoilt brat daughter of a zillionaire fakes her own kidnapping to try to get the attention of daddy but things go wrong as she is mistakenly captured by a car thief br br all the actors in the film are wholly unconvincing br br post 9/11 and baghdad i don't think making a film about kidnapping is funny especially as this one ain't got anything going for it and what is more it simply ain't funny br br in real life someone stealing top of the range motor vehicles would not hesitate in getting rid of any witness rather than falling in love with her which appears to be the ludicrous premise of the film br br the actor playing the private detective brought in to rescue the daughter suffers from always being in awful b pictures and his hair transplant with phoney red hair looks ridiculous br br the actress playing the daughter is completely unattractive in every way except physically and the good guy car thief is a total jerk br br plus a script lacking in any merit whatsoever br br 1 out of 10
