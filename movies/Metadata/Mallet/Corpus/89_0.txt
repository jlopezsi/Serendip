this is one of my very favorite shows wwf/e has put on forgive me i haven't watched this in almost 2 years so my memory may be a bit fuzzy br br european championship probably my favorite opening match of all time d-lo brown vs val venis was far better and longer than i could have possibly hoped for two very capable and horribly underutilized guys getting 15 minutes to shine on a huge show thumbs up great stuff if you're ever wondering why they kept these 2 around for so long check out this match br br oddities vs kaientai nothing too special here basically a comedy match in that sense it was well done a couple funny spots and kaientai is always money but all in all they're wasted here br br hair vs hair jeff jarrett vs x-pac nothing much to say i forget the majority of this match it was nothing spectacular then again i actively dislike both of these guys so this could have been pretty good and i just ignored it check for yourself br br sable/edge vs marc mero/jackie edge fans pick up this show for edge's debut nothing spectacular edge and mero looking ok sable trying her best not to maim anyone with botched moves fairly early in her wrestling career so don't expect anything special br br ken shamrock vs owen hart lion's den match not a technical masterpiece but very solid given the environment limited space for movement inside the modified cage/lion's den seems to handcuff both guys but they made it work worth watching if only to see something you might not have see before this type of match occurred only twice i believe and the other replaces hart with steve blackman who would you rather watch br br tag team championship new age outlaws vs mankind/kane kane no shows leaving mankind to defend on his own if you're a foley fan check this out no one takes a stiff butt kickin like foley and there are few examples of that as good as this nothing close to the spectacle of some of his other matches this one is brutally short emphasis on the brutal br br intercontinental championship ladder match what a great match this stands out in my mind as the match that made rock and hhh up until this point they were upper midcarders leading their respective factions this match proved to me that they're both very capable of working a main-event caliber match and delivering huge not as much emphasis placed on high spots in this match it seems to focus more on again brutality and storytelling very well done one of the forgotten great matches br br world championship steve austin vs undertaker a very well done match especially considering austin was knocked silly when they knocked heads about 3 or 4 minutes in not the greatest match of all time but an important match nonetheless the second ppv title match for these two the first with austin defending great and unexpected high spot features undertaker attempting a huge legdrop from the top turnbuckle onto the announce table impressive visual for a guy that size good match great show check it out
