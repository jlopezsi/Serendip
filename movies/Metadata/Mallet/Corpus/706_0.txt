refreshingly doesn't fall into the trap that most high concept comedies fall into namely coasting on one good central idea and the star power of whomever gets cast in the lead role(s this one takes a delightful wish i'd thought of that premise and actually supports it with a smart well-plotted story go figure sometimes robert deniro has stretched himself too thin and hasn't come off well in comedies such as we're no angels and mad dog glory but here his timing is virtually flawless and his comic rapport with billy crystal also excellent as he avoids making his hapless but still dignified shrink a buffoon is wonderful deniro seems to be most at home comedically when he is spoofing his own intense inarticulate image br br the script is very sharp and shrewdly sidesteps the predictable whenever possible though there is always a certain level of welcome predictability in this sort of material there is a pivotal juncture early on where it looks as if it is going to follow the same old plot line of crystal's fiancee nicely played by lisa kudrow thinking that his sudden unexplained disappearances to meet with the gangster must mean that he is having an affair with another woman this movie is too intelligent for that and has too much respect for the intelligence of its characters crystal comes right out and explains his predicament and the rest of the film is funnier for his honesty the viewer has more admiration for crystal's character and more belief in the couple's sincere desire to be together br br the director and one of the writers harold ramis has demonstrated once again that he is one of the best out there at light satire this is easily one of the most consistently funny at least a half dozen laugh out loud moments and enjoyable comedies to come out in recent years
