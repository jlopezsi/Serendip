i really enjoyed this film it was such an in depth deep powerful scary beautifully done film i absolutely had a blast watching it it was well acted though to be honest i didn't think kiera knightley was that amazing in it especially since she wasn't in it all the way through and i do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from thora birch the one and only problem with this film is that as a very very religious person the excessive nudity and fondling was a problem and the blood was unnecessary but it's hollywood or wherever this film was made and i had low expectations great film though love it to bits one of my faves ever
