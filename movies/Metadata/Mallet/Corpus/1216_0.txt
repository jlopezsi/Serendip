this rather dark film noir with its uneasy comics roscoe ates nana bryant and billy house who even repeats his checkers trick from the stranger and desperate heroine mary beth hughes is further strengthened by the forceful performance of charles russell who manages to make his rather ambivalent drifter somewhat sympathetic admittedly he is helped in this goal by the obnoxious loudmouth and light-on-brains mike who whether by accident or design is made even more repulsive than the screenplay requires by the over-enthusiastic acting of dale belding fortunately when the script gives her a chance mary beth hughes comes to the rescue with her animated portrait of the girl who wants to escape her small town prison br br in keeping with the nocturnal atmosphere of the radio series most of the action takes place at night however although the picture is big on atmosphere despite its obviously limited budget it is somewhat deficient in characterization and motivation the screenplay overstates the one-dimensional comic interludes but dwells little on the forces that drive the main characters why does russell murder the girl is it an accident self-defense the script hints at these factors but why hint and what is the background to this meeting so many questions remain unanswered
