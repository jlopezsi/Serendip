this poke'mon movie is my favorite by far it scores at the top across the board great story great battles great music great characters and great new villains deoxys and rayqueza the opening fight between deoxys and rayqueza always reminds me of godzilla my other favorite japanese export deoxy's infiltration of the city is impressive as is its multiplication scene this movie is one of the darker movies of the series hearkening back to mewtwo strikes back and setting the tone for the next series battle frontier and would be a good watch even for someone who doesn't like poke'mon or anime all in all top notch an improvement over the previous jirachi the wishmaker also a much more mature story the battle at the end between the two deoxys and rayqueza while ash tries to shut down the security droids is very suspenseful top notch
