the problem with this movie for me watching it with my 6-year-old daughter was that this absolute jerk running the show clearly has no idea about what rock and roll is as i know it it's about individuality not conformity it's about diy not this-foot-here-that-foot-there i kept thinking about dana rohrabacher or some other such conservative jock-fascist chameleon using their obvious rock/pop music knowledge to advance the most un-rockin conformist agenda possible or sonny bono sure there are those of you who think that musical rebellion knows no politics but when you aren't at least a libertarian when you're truly in the conservative jock headspace your attitude and danger are as safe and salable as mayonnaise zappa would've known this asshole for what he is a mean dick-head coach whose only concern was that championship listening to this jackass put down 3-chord flannel rock i can only assume he meant nirvana a band whose converse he wouldn't be worthy to lick if they would have ever allowed anyone to lick their shoes br br i still get my mailbox money from my music days we had a lot of fun and i'll always be grateful for the recording and tours but to see everything i love polluted down to a competitive sporting event really turns my stomach i said it years ago and i'll say it again now f*ck you coach
