this is one of those minor but very enjoyable pictures that can easily slip by unnoticed it isn't easy to find and most film noir enthusiasts are familiar only with the title but crime wave deserves to be seen by fans of the noir or crime film genres it's a terrific example of the lower-budget type of dramas that studios were turning out in the 1950s the only major star is sterling hayden who gives his usual acceptable performance here as a disgruntled law enforcer gene nelson probably better known for musicals is an interesting and successful choice for the protagonist a man caught between good and evil there's also an entertaining tough-guy type played by charles bronson br br what really distinguishes crime wave is its extensive use of los angeles locales apparently location shooting was done to save money on sets but with the passage of time movies like this become documents of the way a city looked and operated in a past period a number of scenes take place on busy la streets and they lend a good deal of excitement to the proceedings br br with any luck this picture will become available on video for more to see it's the kind of movie that has the effect of reading a good pulp crime novel or story
