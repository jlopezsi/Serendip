this was a film that got a rather high score in the leonard maltin guide saying the film was still potent well i was excited about seeing it as i love american wwii propaganda films and have seen a huge number of them unfortunately while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today the bottom line is that the film lacks subtlety and has plot holes big enough to fly a b-17 through them the movie begins well enough as frederic march a fine actor is in the lead but my hopes were soon dashed when the little nazi boy emil comes to live with them first it's hard to imagine the nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the us while we are at war with them secondly it's hard to imagine the us government just accepting the kid without making sure he wasn't a spy or an america-hater but regardless here appears a 12 year-old boy who often sounds quite german he uses german and english interchangeably but his accent also wavers a bit almost sounding swedish or polish from time to time i guess you can't blame him that much as this is a very demanding role for a young boy but who you can blame are the writers who immediately throw subtlety out the window instead of the kid pretending to love america or creating trust with his new family he immediately acts like the local chairman of the hitler fan club even showing up to his first meal dressed in full hitler youth regalia including an armband now i don't know about you but if i'd been alive during the war and a kid moved in with me and preceded to parade around the house in nazi uniform spouting hate i think i'd be a bit peeved but march and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the fbi plus while march works on top-secret military plans he does a lousy job of securing them so emil isn't able to steal them also you'd think when he went to school and began spreading hate and nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice no trip to the principal's office no phone calls home and no contact with the local police it just defies all common sense to think that during the war anyone would have been allowed to act this way without being arrested is crazy america does have freedom of speech but for a foreign national spreading pro-nazi propaganda during the war this is ridiculous now if this was the only problem with the film i guess you could chalk it up to naivet unfortunately it got a lot worse emil spread anger and dissent everywhere but no one actually did anything about this so far so good but after 1001 warning signs and when he then tries to kill two people by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another you'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot but in one of the worst endings in film history they stupid family feels sorry for the kid and decides like the beatles once said all you need is love to make matters worse the girl who was beaten with the poker was march's own kid and the lady who convinces march not to press charges in the end was his jewish fianc√©e yecch what drivel the film just doesn't make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this
