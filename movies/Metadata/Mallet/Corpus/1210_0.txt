i remember being entirely taken with this film seeing it several times when it was originally in theaters way back in 82 its creator robert benton freely admitted at the time that he intended this to be an homage to hitchcock and he's largely succeeded right down to the cool mysterious blonde female with a troubled past and the detective who is drawn to her and the balletic deliberate pacing that accentuates the suspense and tension almost to a fault unlike hitchcock this film is strictly serious business with nary a moment of lightness which alas means something less than fun hitchcock always utilized humor no matter how dark it may have been recognizing that it too can actually heighten the suspense by putting people off their guard this film would be richer for that sense but still it remains a good solid mystery as i've said the story is pure hitchcock a murder takes place and a cool mysterious blonde streep may be the prime suspect something that draws new york city detective scheider towards her one comment here said they don't make em classy like this anymore and he couldn't be more right from the restrained low-key performance of streep accent-free but looking perhaps more beautiful here than in any other film she's done she nearly resembles those women in a dutch renaissance painting balancing the livelier performance of scheider to the lovely muted blues browns greys and blacks of its cinematography there are a fair number of jolts and a satisfactory wrap-up too if there is any one fault with the film it is as one user has already commented how slight the script is it's nearly a puff of smoke another asked if we really needed another homage to hitchcock since de palma's been doing it for years however one look at de palma's films and this film and the difference is night and day de palma's films which could be considered almost a hyper-hitchcock are almost too jokey and slavish to its directors flights of fancy while benton's film exhibits the cool reserve almost detachment of its sophisticated new york settings hitchcock was the undisputed master of thrillers and remains so to this day it's wonderful to see other modern directors try their hand at the lost art of the classy thriller/mystery still of the night is definitely worth discovering no matter its minor faults
