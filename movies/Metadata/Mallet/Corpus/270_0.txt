this is a funny funny story about a gay couple pretending to be a straight couple to impress the family of the son's fianc√©e there are moral lessons in this comedy to live and let live and to judge people on their character not their sexual orientation br br my girlfriend and i watched this movie together and we both howled with laughter we still treasure this movie and watch it again and again br br we had not seen either the original play or movie so this was a standalone viewing it was just terrific br br williams and lane are perfect as the gay couple the look on williams face when lane comes into the house when the visitors are there is priceless williams is a great straight guy pun intended for lane's antics br br i judge this movie on the amount of laughs it gave me and that has to be a 10 gene hackman is perfect as usual as a moralizing hypocritical senator
