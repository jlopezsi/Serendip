this movie ain't bad a mob boss going to the shrink is actually a very good idea but i don't think this movie explores the idea in the most interesting manner i would enjoy this movie more if it were more like the<br br tv-series sopranos but i suppose that comparison is an invalid one what the hell it's billy crystal and robert de niro
