i have been an office temp and this portrays the way i felt all too well as others have pointed out it is more than a dilbert spinoff however sprecher does an excellent job of capturing the sense of floating and disconnectedness to use margaret's words in modern society we have a bittersweet ironic story of an individual coming of age as her group of friends breaks apart parker posey's sassy and cynical character pulled me into this movie toni collette at times could be mistaken for a less annoyingly neurotic ally mcbeal lisa kudrow's role is familiar yet tragic instead of comic alanna ubach's character is less developed as she seems to present an alternative she trades her current unhappiness for the traditional misery of a poor marriage br br at the end iris manipulates the barren work environment to her advantage perhaps there is hope for us after all
