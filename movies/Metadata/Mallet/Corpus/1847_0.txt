howdy partners wez gots us here a review today about a movie far from the wild west more like the far east it's got fights guts blood and a story of vengeance it's lady snowblood br br not a horror film but what i like to call samurai splatter cinema throughout the 70's japan made several of these and most of them hold a place in my heart for the crazy upped ante and ballsy acts of on screen violence severed arms legs decapitations torsos and the infamous spraying blood most recently in american cinema seen in kill bill smart observers pay attention to how a lot of this film was used to make the kill bill movies heck even one of the music sequences was ripped right from this movie br br anyway in brief detail the movie is one of pure vengeance lady snowblood is hardly introduced to the world and tragedy hits when her mother dies from childbirth as the story progresses we discover that 4 people killed her father little brother and raped her mother mom was able to kill one of these culprits but it is up to her little assassin snowblood to kill the rest raised by a samurai she is taught the ways of the samurai and once old enough goes on her quest for revenge br br to say anymore would ruin the film as this is one of the finest revenge movies i've seen with a good story and some cool swordplay if you are into lone wolf and cub or the shadow warrior series from the 70's do yourself a favor and check this out this movie is one that lives up to the hype br br 9/10 excellent film on many facets and one of the best samurai films of the 70's br br animego has done a very good job with there dvd release of this film as they have with all the samurai cinema releases they have put out the subtitles are easy to read and do the movie justice so hunt this down and enjoy every blood drenched second
