if you do not want to read spoilers do not read on thank you br br i'll be honest with you i went into the video store looking for something mildly bad but funny enough to keep myself entertained the dvd starts off hilariously with a rapidly-moving movie about zombie chickens making me laugh in hilarity this went on for so long i was happily munching on my hot pocket until it said it was a preview this was followed by another long one which thanks to the genius programmers i couldn't skip passed so i had to fastforward then i finally got to the menu which surprised me to be frank for the price i got it at i wasn't expecting that much the movie started with lloyd kaufman an eccentric jewish man who is the father of a few cult films which made me excited generally anything with troma on it will elicit a what response which is what keeps me going after kaufman speaks with a few cute girls at some horror expo the movie begins well not quite after play some guys talk about how big a i quote exactly a pos this movie was this goes on for awhile until i skip ahead br br first thing i can't help but notice is that the camera and lighting work is about as good as your typical soap opera and sometimes won't even sit still br br the movie starts off jarringly but no one cares two cops kill a guy and put in some framing guns though later they just shoot people for fun not even five minutes in a woman disrobes meaning someone is about to die naked chicks are always a signal something big is about to go down they're in the gym of a community college and one of them i'll say isn't particularly bad to look at any arousal is quickly doused by the biker-chick esquire woman who supposedly gets hit on a lot all of this is just filler until the cuter woman goes in the shower disappears when a hand grabs her and some juice is tossed at the shower wall i should mention the sound is appalling in this scene it's not award winning in any others but the gym is inexcusable kaufman also plays an overacting janitor supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks i'm not kidding that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal homosexual behavior br br these zombies are not really zombies at all they can choose to reveal themselves they are sentient intelligent and well skilled in combat hell they're demons i have no idea where they got zombies from we learn this when a guy who hates late fees kills the clerk by cheaply ripping his heart out and eating it when charged br br we return to the cops who may as well be named good cop and bad cop since it doesn't matter i actually had to take notes throughout this whole thing and to run through them all would fill up the amount of characters i have available so i'll lay out a few of the more glaring memories there's a pointless scene where the bad cop humps to orgasm a car driven by a group of four college kids after belittling them there's also a lengthy conversation about testicles and the eating of said organs there's also a running comment that no one should be in the college at these hours often through a truly pointless subplot about some jerk-turned-good guy who saves a girl he likes who works inventory at a book store despite the implication that it is pretty late at night it's always broad daylight outside most of the killing early on is done by the bad cop who is in fact a good guy the zombies are also major wusses who can be defeated by a few punches there's a half decent fight scene between sensei zombie a kung fu master undead and the good cop after they rescue three useless girls after this they go into a safe house occupied by god despite being a safe house every one inside it eventually dies there's a few other things i could mention but i'd like to skip to the ultimate fight of good v evil good cop is supposedly a warrior of god because of his blood line he fights the head zombie which consists of him getting his punch caught and then ripping the head zombie's heart out think they could've made this scene the climax a bit more interesting i don't know the movie ends with the guy getting gunned down and zombies swarming the world br br wow this is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless before bursting out into laughter what the hell is this br br what is this this is a major piece of crap if you're a fan of that well perhaps you should look into it but the main stream movie-goer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this so by all means avoid br br main stream 1/10 br br masochistic movie-geek 10/10
