by far the most wacked-out teen comedy of all time this bizarre robert altman nugget was adapted from a single issue of national lampoon magazine the 1982 utterly monstrous mind-roasting summer of o.c and stiggs special the plot is simple o.c and stiggs are two bored horny arizona high schoolers who find immense satisfaction in tormenting the schwab family the patriarch is fabulously portrayed by altman regular paul dooley over summer vacation they canoe to mexico buy a machine gun from dennis hopper organize a king sunny ade concert and try to woo cynthia nixon there's no sentimentality in this film whatsoever the two leads are unlikable homophobic morons but it still adds up into a remarkably funny endeavor if you're not in the mood for something with a profound statement to make and enjoy laughing at bizarre non-sequiturs give this film a try
