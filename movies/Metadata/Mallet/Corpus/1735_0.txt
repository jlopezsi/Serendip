this movie is very much in the tradition of kubrick it's quiet it's dramatic sophisticated and beautifully shot the ending is ambiguous open to interpretation cameron bright is convincingly haunted as the possible re-incarnation of anna's nicole kidman deceased husband birth reveals the ways in which love and the removal of that love can traumatize us i did not realize who the director of this film was until after i finished it i was pleased to see that mr glazer has also directed sexy beast which is another excellent film and one of my personal favorites of the past 10 years or so i strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed sexy beast or the work of kubrick
