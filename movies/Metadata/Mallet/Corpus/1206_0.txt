still of the night is indeed a very silent and dark movie a few remarks 1 the characters move from from strange places an auction room's warehouse an isolated laundromat to even stranger places a tunnel in central park a ghostly villa on a cliff 2 the significant events only happen at night 3 the main characters seem totally unable to communicate one with another 4 they all seem to hide shameful psychological cracks for all these reasons i would say that sotn is an impressionist movie apart from the finale all is suggested more than described br br in a way sotn is also a fetichist movie the real heroes are the objects the characters are their slaves if you think i'm going too far watch the scene in which meryl streep holds the vase in her hands br br of course sotn is a tribute to hitchcock for instance the villa is an obvious reminiscence of psycho but it is intelligently done and contains enough twists to help you forget that yes it's been done before br br 8/10
