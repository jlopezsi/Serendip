here's another film in which i totally go against the critics both professional and on this board who take themselves too seriously at times they hated this sequel to the blues brothers but i enjoyed it very much they need to chill a bit and realize the purpose of this film simply a tribute to the music br br how could any fan of blues not like this i mean look at all the great performers in this film and how much better does it get to have all of them join in for a couple of jam sessions at the end the movie sports a who's who of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by john landis who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years br br plus it was simply a funny movie with two funny guys dan akyroyd and john goodman and a really neat-looking little kid in j evan bonifant who really makes me laugh just looking at this 10-year-old dancing is his blues brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe the car chases the dances and clothing and over-the-top story all add up to two hours of lamed-brained fun no this isn't shakespeare and it wasn't mean to be it's a much nicer-edged movie than the first blues brothers too unfortunately too many people want edgy material all the time br br not only are the characters colorful so is the cinematography making it both a visual and audio treat so just look at it as a blue concert with laughs and hopefully you'll enjoy it
