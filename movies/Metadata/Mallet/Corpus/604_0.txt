following the release of the birth of the nation 1915 director d.w griffith has often been branded with the unfortunate attribute of being a racist while it's difficult to argue with that film's unabashed advocacy of the kkk it's also interesting to observe a few of griffith's other films in which he displays an undeniable sensitivity towards other cultures take for example broken blossoms 1919 where a chinese immigrant portrayed admittedly by american richard barthelmess is shown to be by far the film's most compassionate and respectable male character the red man's view 1909 was one of hundreds of short films that griffith produced for the biograph company from 1908-1913 and it represents a pivotal step in the development of the western genre one of the earliest to explore the conflicts between native americans and european settlers the film treats the plight of the indians with respect and empathy quietly condemning the actions of the conquerers who invaded the land and left countless tribes homeless br br living a comfortable and happy existence in the remote wilderness a native american tribe goes about its daily business a young man silver eagle owen moore has fallen in love with a beautiful maiden and it seems that nothing can come between the adoring couple however as one might expect a conflict of cultures is on the horizon a ragged pack of unkempt settlers emerges over the hill pistols at their sides and they arrogantly demand that the native americans move from the area after a brief but fruitless protest the tribe chooses to avoid a violent confrontation and regretfully departs but not before the nefarious settlers claim silver eagle's young maiden as their own torn between the love for his sweetheart and loyalty towards his dying father the young man mournfully follows suit the tribe walks for miles it seems but they are unable to find a suitable place to live having been permanently uprooted from their home they must accept the sad truth that their lives will never be the same again br br working with a running time of just eleven minutes griffith has very little time to recruit our sympathies for the primary characters but he does quite an good job there's something inherently devastating in watching the tribe marching solemnly away from their spiritual home a slow sorrowful procession of broken souls for some reason john ford's the grapes of wrath 1940 another film about a displaced family came immediately to mind during these sequences it's an uneven comparison of course but that's just the association that my brain made griffith almost fools us into accepting a makeshift happy ending as one settler suddenly attains a conscience and apologetically returns silver eagle's maiden to him but the conclusion is more tragic than anything else silver eagle mourns at the side of his deceased father knowing that even with his sweetheart by his side his tribe has no home to which they can return if only for its unique storytelling perspective the red man's view is essential viewing for anybody wishing to experience yet another aspect of america's first great director
