i saw the birdcage because i'd already seen la cage aux folles and i thought this one was a great remake if not better robin williams and nathan lane give hilarious performances as the lead couple i haven't seen la cage in ages but there were tidbits in the birdcage that i remembered from the original of all american remakes of french movies this is by far my favorite
