the glass house 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br the glass house takes place in a beautiful luxurious glass mansion complete with swimming pools expensive artwork high-tech security systems and just about everything else the wealthy occupants terry and erin glass stellan skarsgard and diane lane become legal guardians of sixteen-year old rudy leelee sobieski and eleven-year old rhett trevor morgan when the kids parents die in an automobile accident br br terry and erin were the best friends of the children's parents they welcome their new guests into a world of wealth glamour and fun soon enough however rudy notices strange quirks about these seemingly friendly folks is terry secretly watching rudy change her clothes is erin addicted to prescription drugs or is she a diabetic was her parents death an accident or a diabolical act of murder trust becomes as transparent as the glass surrounding this family br br the glass house opened to mostly negative reviews and not without probable cause the setup provides an intriguing imaginative situation but everything happens so quickly the film forgets character introduction first time-feature director daniel sackheim helms a hole-laden script by wesley strick that creates more plot holes than swiss cheese the film derives into involving material but lacks the focus to play out these plot points br br while daniel sackheim and wesley strick create a movie that lacks the timeliness and intelligence of a first-rate edge-of-your-seat thrill ride the glass house does offer good suspense and a plot that reveals itself with tantalizing sinister hints and increasing tension it keeps us guessing even if this diabolical fairy tale is anything but surprising br br leelee sobieski has been in a lot of movies lately and that's not a coincidence she is a very talented actress and she carries the glass house through many plot miscalculations trevor morgan seen in jurassic park 3 adequately supports sobieski's thorough convincing performance the very gifted diane lane and stellan skarsgard cover their sinister motives with pretentious personalities but inject a mysterious menacing undercurrent br br the glass house also provides a fresh unique outlook on villains instead of causing trouble these characters get themselves into trouble which eventually makes them dangerous innovative original twists like these are what make this movie worth a look they say those who live in glass houses should not throw stones but the villains in the glass house do and it's only a matter of time before everything shatters and breaks apart it's quite involving watching these events come about especially through a character driven story br br
