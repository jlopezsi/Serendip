in my opinion monk is one of the best shows i have seen in a long time the main characters detective adrian monk tony shalhoub and his friend and personal assistant sharona fleming the very talented yet underrated bitty schram are very likeable and well-drawn more importantly the episodes are very well-written and highly amusing i definitely recommend it
