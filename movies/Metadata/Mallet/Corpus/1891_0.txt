hellgate is one of the few films that defy a proper synopsis there are so many strange goings-on that i really have to wonder how much acid must've been taken by everyone involved in conceiving this film to actually bring it to life short of giving a play by-play that would take three pages to fully explain the plot of this super strange film-i'll try to sum up the very basics of the storyline as simply as possible br br the plot surrounds four friends who try to solve the mystery surrounding a local ghost story about a resurrected dead girl who was originally killed by a biker-gang in a ghost town called appropriately enough hellgate a glowing blue crystal that can melt mutate or bring things back to life and the bizarro zombie-like residents of hellgate itself br br understand that the above is the barest-bones so to speak outline of the basic plot of this uber-weird film that said-i'm sorta surprised at all the extremely negative reviews of this one granted-it's definitely not a good film by any means the acting is mostly laughable the majority of the special fx are pretty weak and the plot is very strange to say the least but despite-or possibly because of these facts-i found hellgate to be oddly enjoyable as weird as the storyline is it does make sense in the overall context of the film the silly dialogue and goofy acting fit the tone and the fx-though ranging from ridiculous to mediocre-are effective enough for this type of b-movie oddity there's a few decent titty-shots from a couple of the attractive female leads as well which doesn't hurt things either-especially from the resurrected-ghost-girl who's pretty f!ckin smokin not much to speak of in the way of gore-but there's a bit of the red-stuff thrown around br br for those that hate hellgate-i guess i can't blame em-but i can't see how anyone that can enjoy a bit of b-grade popcorn schlock wouldn't at least be entertained by this one my copy of hellgate is on a stand-alone disc-but i understand that there's a double-feature version that has this and the pit on it personally i also enjoyed the pit quite a bit perhaps also against popular opinion and definitely feel that the pit is the stronger of the two-so if you can find the double-disc for cheap and enjoy campy films-i'd recommend picking it up 7/10
