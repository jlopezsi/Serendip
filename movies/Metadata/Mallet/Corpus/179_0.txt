tomorrow is forever is a great movie i think claudette colbert and orson welles are great together and even though orson welles rarely played the romantic lead he's wonderful i cried during most of the movie the first time i saw it there are also wonderful performances by george brent and young natalie wood tomorrow is forever is a movie you need to see at least once it's great
