ms arquette is hot aside from that she has created a film that is one of the finest films about music that i have seen br br the lady who inspired toto's big hit speaks with a whole lotta musicians about the business of music they all appear to be coherent as in sex sobriety and rock roll br br the majority of the artists have been well known for over thirty years and some of them almost did not make it this far i am glad that they did i just hope that joni mitchell does not end up like sammy davis junior br br i could have watched another several hours of ms arquette's interviews perhaps not in one sitting but certainly in two parts
