this was a pretty faithful adaptation of philip k dick's story the second variety the only major difference is that instead of a cold war setting on earth they used a corporate setting on a colony world br br so why did this movie rock because they stuck to the story which was quite a good one of killer robots who decide to ignore their programming to attack the enemy and consider all humans the enemy and have developed a way to replicate them in the process br br peter weller whom i don't consider a great actor is at his best here as a war weary commander who stumbles onto this shocking fact as he tries to get back to his base to warn his comrades jennifer rubin is pretty good as a killer android who doesn't know what she is until the climax br br they gave it a happier ending than dick did but still a solid film
