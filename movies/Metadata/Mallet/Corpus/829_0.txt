this review reveals almost everything about this story so if you want to enjoy the mystery first then stop right now and come back after you've seen the film br br the title is classic misdirection by writers this story has nothing specific to do with a moustache it is merely a symbol used to highlight the idea of identity and more particularly the extent to which a husband and wife are aware of each other br br the story is as follows the fade in opens with a successful parisian businessman marc thiriez vincent lindon shaving off his moustache while having a bath when confronting his wife agnes emmanuelle devos she fails to evince any surprise somewhat puzzled because only a few moments prior agnes had said how much she liked his moustache marc says nothing but continues on to a dinner engagement to serge and nadia schaeffer mathieu amalric and marcha polikarpova where they all say nothing about his new look later suspecting a trick marc confronts agnes at their apartment where she categorically denies marc has ever had a moustache br br oooops br br dumbfounded marc has a troubled sleep but goes to work the next morning convinced that agnes and their so-called friends are out to get him for some unknown reason at the office and the nearby coffee shop where marc has dined all too often the same situation persists nobody makes any comment about the absence of his moustache br br hence for marc the puzzle worsens br br he begins to panic he searches for the remains of his moustache in the garbage he seeks confirmation from a stranger that a photo from a 2003 holiday in bali shows him with a moustache but later that day he asks agnes to cancel a lunch with his parents and she replies that his father died a year earlier questioning her further marc realizes with mounting horror that she cannot even recall their friends serge and nadia br br what's going on here am i crazy thinks marc confused and shattered he falls into a stupor and sleeps again allowing agnes to slip a knock-out mickey finn to him hours later he wakes to hear agnes and bruno hippolyte giradou his office associate discussing plans to have him committed to an asylum frantic marc runs off to find his parents but is unable to contact them and calls agnes to meet him while watching from a taxi after she leaves with bruno marc quickly gets his passport a coat and money and goes to the airport where he boards a flight for hong kong br br when he gets there he wanders around a bit alternately ferrying from hong kong to kowloon and back a few times a great metaphor for his indecision then pays his way onto a coastal trader to finally wind up at an un-named coastal village he wanders off from the boat and ends up at a run-down hotel where he pays for a room and falls asleep exhausted br br okay stop right here all of the above is marc's dream or nightmare i guess br br the next real scene we see marc unshaven with many weeks growth wolfing down noodles at a local restaurant after the meal he wanders back to the hotel where he finds and as the viewer we also find agnes packing their bags to return to paris she tells him to shave off his growing beard and suggests he also remove his moustache when he does so she remarks how much it suits him they go to bed they make love she sleeps marc lies there for a long while eyes closed then he opens his eyes wide blankly and silently screaming am i awake or is this a dream fade to black br br so here's the real story marc and agnes are on holiday near hong kong where he hopes to resurrect what he thinks is their dead or dying marital and sexual relationship one night he has a nightmare about his innermost fears and desires the next morning fortuitously agnes suggests he change his image more or less in keeping with his prior dream and so he does happily for marc she actually notices the difference and things appear to be better unhappily however aspects of his dream remain most particularly a post card that he wrote out in his dream or did he br br hence when marc stares into the darkness is it truly reality this is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together first there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him which generates the bizarre dream set in paris while they are both on holiday in china and second there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself as the final scene very slowly fades to black the camera fixes on marc's troubled eyes the unspoken question screaming at us am i in a dream now or have i woken up so does agnes truly love me or no br br that's for you and all of us to decide br br when you see the movie watch out for the clues that tell you it's all a dream as the credits roll there are city lights on dark water water heavily connoting sex with a sampan just in view a long column of lights from skyscraper a phallic symbol much repeated later in the story the photos from bali every lover's dream destination as they drive to the dinner date with serge and nadia agnes makes a shocking admission to marc about the way she dresses at work marc is so confused he says to himself i must be dreaming and just when marc leaves to go to work agnes calls him back and says marc this is like a bad trip br br some trip see how you like it
