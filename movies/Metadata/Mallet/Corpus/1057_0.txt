i seem to be in the minority here i can't understand why this<br br movie isn't getting the most enthusiastic reviews br br sure the plot has been visited again and again in books movies<br br and tv including richard basehart's mind being taken over at<br br least 34 times in voyage to the bottom of the sea does that<br br matter so much haven't we seen saving private ryan and a.i br br before did anyone criticize them as just another longest day br br or just another robot wants to be human movies br br the puppet masters is expertly handled the direction is tight and<br br suspense-building the early scenes of the kids with the ufo<br br roadside attraction are clever sutherland is great the dialogue<br br is realistic this remains one of my favorites
