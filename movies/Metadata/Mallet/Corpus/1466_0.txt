the works of howard phillip lovecraft continue to thwart film makers his tales written in the early 1900's are invariably updated to present day and forced to mix with today's fads trends and movie absorbing mind set for the most part they don't work like this shot at the trophy anything by good ol h.p should be a period piece like jackson's king kong unless you are extremely brilliant the makers of chill while sincere failed to create the magic to move cool air which this movie is based upon from short-story written in 1926 to a contemporary story no fault no foul a near impossible thing to do lovecraft excruciatingly cultivated sinister and dark atmosphere with climactic punctuations of visual action almost the opposite of current films that are visually heavy to create the deep and dark unease something they seldom do because perhaps they are running a formula in reverse dan o'bannon nearly nailed it with the resurrected from lovecraft's the case of charles dexter ward unfortunately this attempt to bring cool air to the screen is a lousy shot at a lovecraft adaptation and can't stand on its own as a horror film kudos for the effort but way big miss
