the story of 4 uni students spending a few days in a world war ii bunker it could've been soo much more a hugely promising start with the characters given emotional depth in the early scenes and the key relationships clearly defined in particular martin taylor daniel brocklebank is a fantastic character it's a shame he wasn't in the hole as well it would've been more interesting br br the main crux of the film revolves around liz thora birch and her youthful desire for son-of-a-rockstar mike steel desmond harrington however a false start recollection and the way the film is conducted by flashbacks under psychoanalysis is not overly effective slowing the pace down quite a lot the claustrophobia of being trapped in an underground bunker rarely comes across and the impression i got from the trailer turned out to be false br br i didn't expect a huge amount from this movie it was one of those much like the gift where i thought it might be good and it might be bad hopefully interesting the only solace i could find in this really was the intensity that was built up at various points in flashes some of the cast are excellent particularly in portraying the interrelations of the group members but only in flashes a lot of things are left unexplained there is a death where the body is strangely scarred and the reason for this is unexplained the autopsy would not appear to have required such a scar to be caused so why br br overall disappointing 4/10
