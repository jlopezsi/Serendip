spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers br br best one yet of the japanese series on the technical craftsmanship side of things well shot well art directed wonderfully told with generally minimal exposition and delightful visual storytelling great sound edit as well except for a couple of the over the top screams in the forest solid ending and really a great way to get everyone on the same page at last about who the hell sadako really is and how she actually died sweet really enjoyed the dutch roll camera tilt during the conversation between sadako and her dad and who can forget the excellent reveal of the two dead ladies and their home made instant wall flowers sadako is an inspiration to disco floors world wide with her crazy possessed resurrected girl two-step approach really something special in that girl wonderfully portrayed by the stunning yukie nakama bonus features on the dvd are loads of fun as well really enjoyed the bonus sadako material
