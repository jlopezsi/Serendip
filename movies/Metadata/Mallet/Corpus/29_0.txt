many of you have posted comments on clockwatchers as a portrayal of office life not true it is a movie based on each of the 4 main characters personal identity struggle and nothing more than that watch it again and forget that they are in an office setting focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters br br i'll give you a hint lisa kudrow's character has bulimia nervosa br br guess who has ocd br br never ignore the obvious and never over-look the obscure br br a great movie 10 stars
