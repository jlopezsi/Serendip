stephen vittoria performs a public service with this dynamite doc on george mcgovern a man who embodies what all americans who aspire to public service should be mcgovern's inherent decency cost him one of the nation's most crucial presidential elections in 1972 running against the original king of dirty tricks richard milhouse nixon although mcgovern's platform was somewhat vindicated when nixon's white house was outed by bob woodward and carl bernstein as the most corrupt administration in american history with tricky dick's resignation soon following the tragedy of his loss and his subsequent fade into the background of american history still resonates br br hopefully our best and brightest young people will see this film and will be inspired by sen mcgovern and his message to enter public service and contribute to making this country and this planet a better place as of right now we have nowhere to go but up kudos to you steve and bravo senator mcgovern
