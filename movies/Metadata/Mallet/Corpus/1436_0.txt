i beg to differ this production was by far the best of the films made of this story i did not laugh at all in fact i would like to own a vhs or a dvd of this film if possible br br i loved all the movies featuring stewart granger he was a captivating star i also liked the actor ian ireland who played sir henry the photography was very good and the film created an ambiance/mood befitting this mystery br br despite the fact that it has been many years since i have seen it and i am not really able to point out specific details i can safely say that this was an entertaining movie
