this is john wayne's first color film and my only complaint is that the cinematographer failed to pick up the unique almost purple color of his eyes br br taken from a much-loved novel of the time the shepard of the hills tells a simple story exceptionally well br br an older man appears at a cabin door and gives aid without a question as to how the accident happened he saves a child he wants to purchase a piece of property and settle down br br the mountain people of the ozark region do not welcome strangers yet this man seems to fit in with his quiet ways and his vast knowledge of the outside world most of the mountain people have never seen br br harry carey is this quiet man he is splendid in every scene john wayne plays young matt matthews'a young man still mourning his mother and who has sworn a blood oath to kill the man responsible his father br br betty field is marvelous as young matt's girlfriend harry carey thoughtful and quietly charming at mr howard the shepard of the hills as his new neighbors call him beula bondi is fascinating as aunt molly and margery main shines as the blind woman that mr howard sends to the city to have her sight restored br br many of the scenes are extraordinary for their detail and sense of authenticity br br some are incredibly beautiful for example when mr howard meets the young man who was struck by lightning and can no longer speak br br a thoroughly absorbing and skillfully made film well worth watching again and again
