a magnificent adaptation of shakespeare's julius caesar enhanced by the splendor of rome at its full glory under julius caesar charlton heston is at his best as marc anthony and makes you feel as if shakespeare wrote the part for him i have mixed feelings about the choice of john gielgud as caesar there are times in the movie that he portrays caesar well as the aloof dictator and others when he overacts as he does in most of his roles jason robards is a fine actor but not as brutus unless stuart burge intended to experiment with this role as a spaghetti western robard's dialogue is wooden robert vaughn shines as casca as does richard johnson as cassius richard chamberlain portrays well a self opinionated octavius caesar the opening of the movie is a masterpiece of imagery and impact and one is plunged into the involvement of the triumphal entry of julius caesar into rome and the aftermath why on earth there has been no dvd release of this movie beggar's belief
