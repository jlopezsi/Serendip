it is always hard to review a movie that is just so bad hellgate proves to be one of those movies starring ron palillo of welcome back cotter and playing a smaller part in friday the 13th part 6 this is absolutely the best this movie can muster other than some nudity of the co-star abigail wolcott as josie br br the story unfolds in classic manner we start with a flashback of a biker gang coming into the town of hellgate they kidnap josie and murder her in front of her father her father distraught over the death of his daughter finds away to bring her back from the dead using a mysterious stone that was found in a mine unfortuanitly he goes mad with power and turns the town of hellgate into a ghost town 30 years later two couples end up exploring into hellgate to find out about the mystery and get more than they bargained for br br i saw this film about 10 years ago and couldn't remember whether it was any good or not to watch over so with a little bit of searching i found a fairly decent copy of this flick i will put it this way this is a hard film to sit through it starts off kind of interesting with its back story but just goes on a tangent of hopeless boredom bad acting and horrendous script writing most of the movie seems to be torn from a bad comedy or an old fashioned horror film and not melding together with pretty results and the worst part is the ending just falls flat on its face with absolutely no real climax the only part i really liked was josie's crazy father in the movie who apparently can't speak a word of english br br altogether if you have a very high tolerance for movies such as this go ahead and check it out otherwise stay very very far away 4/10
