the monk television series is one of the most original refreshing and well-cast shows i have ever seen monk and sherona are terrific together excellent chemistry i do not know if new shows are being filmed and aired but i certainly hope so i stay up late on friday nights to catch monk on usa and enjoy it tremendously last night's episode about the murderous marathon runner was fantastic and i laughed out loud at monk's antics on the jogging trail while he tries out the new running shoes given to him by his guru i love the show including the whole cast thank you
