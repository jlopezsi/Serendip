this film has received quite a few negative posts i also read leonard maltin's review in which he said that it was full of holes and was a weak hitchcock homage i really think people are all wrong about this one it's full of some very good old-fashioned suspense and i love all of the hitch touches many here have already noted as well it must be recalled that hitch dealt in many implausibilities in his films he hated those who constantly pointed out that that could never happen in real life it's not real life it's a movie that's one of the ways i thought this film succeeded was in reflecting or even gently parodying hitch's use of things that would never happen in real life loved the chemistry between meryl and roy not to mention the lovely mentor/parent shrink/shrink relationship between roy and jessica nice work from robert benton i love this film matthew hays
