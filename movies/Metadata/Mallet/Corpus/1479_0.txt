awful slow boring lacking plot a painful experience and an utter waste of time see it at the cheap theatre anymore then a few bucks for this is hi-way robbery over an hour before anything happened that was remotely exciting i can't express how repulsed i am by this movie i liken it to chinese water torture i just wished it would end i fear when the next poorly delivered line would come ruby is hot in her bikini the only bright note
