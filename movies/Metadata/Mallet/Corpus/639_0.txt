it is hilarious to see a detective trying to work while fighting extreme obsessive/compulsive behavior as well as germaphobia strong enough to merit using anti-bacterial wipes after every handshake while these tendencies sometimes take center stage the writing is well-balanced and touching so that it becomes a very enjoyable comedy/drama and not a ridiculous farce entertaining and engaging for just about anyone
