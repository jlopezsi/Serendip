this is a unique movie as it is the last performance charles nelson reilly ever did of his one man show to watch him tell his stories is to see a master weave his craft into words that keep you consistently engrossed by what he has to tell br br cnr's life is fascinating there is much more to him than most people will ever know for years you just knew him as the guy on match game and that funny guy on the lucy episode or wasn't he on ghost and mrs muir something about him in all of those things stuck out enough for people to remember him the man is an amazing performer and his words are rich in with the history of broadway hollywood and his personal life br br this film needs to be released on dvd or somehow the gameshow network needs to make a deal with the film maker and show it on the gameshow network or release it with one of the dvd sets people need to see it
