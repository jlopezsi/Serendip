contender for the worst film ever made br br i saw this movie for the first time at the recommendation of a friend he warned me it would be painful to watch but i had no idea how painful it would turn out to be br br this film the english version i saw is entitled battle of the last panzer is intended as a wwii epic depicting the struggle of a german tank crew caught behind enemy lines trying to get themselves and their vehicle back to german-held territory br br other than that i will make no attempt to describe the insanely fragmented and incoherent plot you simply have to see it for yourselves br br everything about this movie is just plain bad the plot the dialog the setting the special effects the equipment and uniforms and the acting br br the star of the show is the lieutenant in command of the crew capital letters indicate emphasis br br any attempt at disobedience or talk of desertion will be punished by death br br as the fuehrer said those who are not with us are against us br br you have one minute no more to throw down your arms and get out of sight after that minute i'll advance rapid fire br br the film is supposed to be set in france after the d-day invasion but in place of the lush green fields of normandy the landscape is arid and looks like sicily or the south of spain br br the uniforms are the best americans wearing italian uniforms complete with italian rank and helmets the weapons they are carrying are modern g3 assault rifles the germans are no better they are carrying italian-made baretta submachineguns and pistols last but not least their tiger tank is an old us m-48 tank br br writing these comments is proving to be almost as painful as watching the film however it's a must see if you want a real shock watch it right after saving private ryan or band of brothers and you'll find out just how bad bad can be
