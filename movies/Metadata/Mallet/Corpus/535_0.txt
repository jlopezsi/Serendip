if you have seen the trailers or read some of the reviews you would be forgiven of thinking of this film as a dark and disturbing thriller unfortunately this is not the case br br the acting is first rate from the leading five though embeth davidtz an experienced actress is confined to a character with little scope for the talents she has displayed in previous films and i find it disappointing that her acting skills were curtailed by such a restrictive screenplay br br and herein lies the main problem for this film the characterisations are excellent but the limited experience of the writers shines through this film has none of the twists and turns you would expect from a thriller an ending that is at once unconvincing predictable and weak and plot holes you could drive a bus through br br director nick hamm shows great promise as this film is very well put together and he certainly gets the best from the main four actors however he seems to have neglected the talents of everyone else in the film bar daniel brocklebank as martin br br in my opinion this film was well acted and directed if only the plot could have been better we might have seen another classic british film however i fear that this film will sink into obscurity it seems a shame that such talent was not used on a film with better writers br br i await with anticipation nick hamm's next offering and hope that he finds a screenplay to stretch both himself and the whole cast
