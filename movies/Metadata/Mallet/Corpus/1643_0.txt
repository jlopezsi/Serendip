detractors may highlight the unnecessary violence in this stylish piece of film-making but pay them no attention n refn's 2nd feature is cutting it pretty close when it comes to assessing life's terrible lessons br br using almost the same cast as he did in his debut pusher bleeder tells the story of how a father-to-be deals with his impending fate it addresses his current state of mind his readjustment of values and how all this would adversely affect the people around him the violence is necessary as the characters emanate from the streets and one can only infer from the several scenes that the neighbourhood is rough and littered with gangs and racial tension br br there is also a secondary story about the budding relationship between a video store clerk and a well-read waitress which is as sweet as it is subtle it's interesting to note that their tastes in videos and books are pretty gritty as well
