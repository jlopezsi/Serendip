this film couldn't miss for me as i love steve martin's irresistibly funny early films and rank film noir as probably my favourite movie genre br br right from the start we're comfortingly deposited back into the noir era with the classic universal revolving black and white logo presaging miklos rosza's sweeping score and the equally welcome news in the title credits that the great sadly soon to be late edith head is costume designer from there it's a short journey into beautifully shot monochromatic cinematography and martin's deliberately clich√©d voice-over setting the scene for a roller-coaster plot as deliberately convoluted as anything this side of the maltese falcon or the big sleep br br the humour is typical early-martin which you either love or hate i'm in the former camp and as ever steve's not above a little vulgarity to drive out the bigger laughs for instance his hilarious re-organising of passed-out leading lady rachel ward's out of whack breasts or his answer to lana turner's what are we going to do now question as she enters his bedroom kinsey cover-to-cover br br the vintage film-clips are cleverly inserted into the plot so that we get a dream cast their lines and actions woven even if tenuously into the narrative although ironically the poorer film-quality of some of their scenes work against the glossier quality of the modern camera-work br br martin's by turns quirky and laconic delivery works well in context although rachel ward pretty as she is seems too lightweight in her part although she does have some considerable footprints to step into bette or lana she isn't a kathleen turner later brilliant in martin's sci-fi spoof the man with two brains or jessica lange not long out of a noir remake the postman always rings twice would i think have worked better even director reiner gets a no show without punch role as the scheming want the world nazi dictator behind the shenanigans br br the jokes come thick and fast and there are plenty of running gags to keep you entertained throughout i myself will try to look up one or two of the vintage prototypes which i hadn't even heard of never-mind seen i walked alone starring kirk douglas and especially the bribe with a stellar cast of ava gardner charles laughton and vincent price with what looks like a literally crackerjack of a finale br br the combination of old film and new was later taken up by woody allen in zelig and was further elaborated on in subsequent hollywood films like who framed roger rabbit and the overrated forrest gump but i'll take messrs martin reiner's stylish rib-tickling homage any day of the week just don't mention the cleaning lady
