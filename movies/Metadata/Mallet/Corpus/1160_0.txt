patrick yau is a great and talented director i haven't seen anything else by him yet than this the longest nite 1997 but his other works include the odd one dies and expect the unexpected which have also been hailed by hk fanatics and specialists however the longest nite alone shows the director's talent and this is easily among the most interesting and memorable hk films of the late 90's br br tony leung and lau ching wan are the two leads here tony is a wonderful actor with smooth and kind face yet his character here is anything but nice or kind he plays a rawly violent and corrupted policeman who solves some mysterious triad war in which he is himself somehow related too also a mysterious bald headed stranger soon arrives in macau lau and soon these two men are against each other and time it all happens during one night filled with depravity violence and seemingly no hope for a better tomorrow br br i think the plot and story is very hard to follow after one viewing and the less you are experienced with english subtitles the more times you will have to see this film in order to understand the whole plot and its turns i have seen this twice now and still there are elements which i cannot yet explain but they're not so important as the things this film gives and has are already visible to me br br the film lacks every imaginable bit of the usual lightening humor and slapstick attempts the film is as serious and gritty as they come and the film is produced by the legendary johnnie to a director/producer specialized in this kind of gritty and dark stuff in hong kong cinema one of his most incredible achievements is a triad thriller the big heat 1988 starring waise lee which is among my personal all time hong kong favourites in its insanity and over-the-top dark and infernal atmosphere johnnie has done many other great films too which include the heroic trio 1993 and its sequel both directed with the choreography genius ching siu tung br br the longest nite features a nice soundtrack which is little like giorgio moroder's music in de palma's scarface 1983 and it adds very well to the atmosphere of the film but the strongest element in the longest nite is the photography and lightning which are often very gorgeous in the hands of a talented hong kong director films like dr lamb danny lee 1992 city on fire ringo lam 1986 or red to kill billy tang 1993 would not be as powerful as they are now without the usage of haunting colors like blue which bath in fog and mist usually the light or should i say darkness coming through windows the final gun battle between the two protagonists in the longest nite is among the greatest scenes i've seen in hong kong cinema in recent times and it features exactly this usage of blue nearly as powerfully as possible br br the violence and brutal world the film is set in is often off putting but never gratuitously graphic and exploitative there's no blood spraying all over the walls but realistic aftermath when someone decides to hurt some other violence never pays in this film as it doesn't in real life either the longest nite doesn't glorify violence at all it just depicts people who are so desperate and weak they use it very often and so the film and ending is pretty pessimistic too unlike in many hollywood action no-brainers like the steven seagal films in the longest nite wickedness and violence always has its consequences and results br br the longest nite is very welcome addition to the gritty triad films genre of the hong kong cinema and due to its great and believable performances and characters gorgeous visuals and overall honesty it will last many viewing times without losing its power and impact i gladly give this 8/10 and maybe my rating will rise after subsequent viewings
