this is an astoundingly good movie br br i'm neither a big claudette colbert fan nor one of orson welles i find her usually too cloying and chick-flickish and him too morose and self-important but they are fabulous together in this wonderful film the characters treat each other with great respect and dignity the dialog is marvelous sensitive subject matter like war is dealt with honestly and non-ideologically br br the triangle of welles colbert and brent is very good added bonus jarrod barkley from big valley in his first role he looks exactly the same 20 years earlier br br i don't know why tcm gave this only two stars perhaps it's not trashy enough for their devolving ethos br br ten stars
