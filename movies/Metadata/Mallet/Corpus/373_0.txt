i thought this movie was brilliant i am a huge fan of the ginger snaps series and i think this one is amazing this film is mainly about brigitte as the first one was mainly about ginger although ginger does appear for a few minutes in some bits of the movie brigitte has the majority of the movie some may be disappointed as ginger is gone but brigitte is very good in her role which makes up for ginger's absence emily perkins in my opinion plays brigitte fitzgerald far better in this movie than the first for one she has real hair now secondly brigitte has a huge contrast to the other character in the movie which attracts you to her dark personality more one of those attracted is the comic book obsessed ghost who is fascinated by the mysterious sister and wants to know more about her but brigitte being brigitte she's become very anti-social ghost is a strange girl she doesn't seem to be able to divide the comic book world from the real world which can make her annoying as she seems to go on about darkness and such she's a chatterbox and is constantly pestering brigitte wondering what she is hiding from everyone the werewolves in ginger snaps ii unleashed were far better than the original ginger snaps movie these werewolves have developed from the weird pink things they were before and now have fur proper fangs and scary yellow eyes i would recommend this movie to whoever liked the first one it's got a bit less gore and more sexual references but the darkness of brigitte's role and the weird ghost makes this film amazing 10
