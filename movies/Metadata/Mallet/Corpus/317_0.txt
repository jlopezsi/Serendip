for the few who happen to be fans of peter weller this is certainly one to hang onto a great little film that is just as brutal and vicious as any movie by paul verhoeven i was surprised verhoeven didn't direct a film like this a little cheesy but often times interesting screamers is a little film i like quite a bit the funny thing is i liked this film even though i had watched twelve monkeys just a couple hours earlier i did a little theater hopping a cool little film with a freaky ending
