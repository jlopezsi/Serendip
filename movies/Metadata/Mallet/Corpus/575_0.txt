this is one of my favorite episodes i love watching diane baker and robert vaughn wilfrid hyde-white is also in it both vaughn and hyde-white are columbo veterans by now i love the unusual love story in this film an i won't spoil it for the viewers i love columbo and have seen almost all of them about a hundred times the commodore is murdered while he was a proud businessman he is disgusted by the greedy vultures that seem more interested in money than sailing he had created an empire from building boats yachts and ships diane baker plays his alcoholic daughter and i believe she is one of the best actresses around who doesn't get enough credit or work in my opinion robert vaughn plays her husband there are a lot more twist and turns in this episode than the usual columbo episode but it's always entertaining and worth watching with great actors
