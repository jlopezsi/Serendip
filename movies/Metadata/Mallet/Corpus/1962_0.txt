this unique made for tv movie has what most modern films do not have a well constructed plot or just a plot although simple as the best often are i don't think it has ever been shown on british tv since about 1980 though i know it has been shown at least twice altogether because i remember my dad telling me he had seen it and giving away the ending the setting is an antarctic research station staffed by 2 lone scientists throughout the winter and otherwise occupied only by a collection of cute experimental chimpanzees the bleak and menacing atmosphere given by the location is added to by the central mystery of the unexplained disappearance of the 2 researchers who staffed the building the previous year strange noises and unexplained little happenings occur throughout and tension builds as it appears there is a someone or something prowling the premises now comes my spoiler animal rights activists will love the twist ending
