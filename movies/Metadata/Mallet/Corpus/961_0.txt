well that's odd i thought as i picked up the june 98 issue of cmj monthly there's this ad in it for a movie called shooting fish with kate beckinsale in it i love kate beckinsale well did in the other two movies i'd seen her in before)with a soundtrack that's got music from dubstar and space and the supernaturals and dionne warwick so anyway to make a long story short i searched in vain for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail anyway then one day i was at the video store major video before blockbuster decided to buy that too and i saw it and thought jaysis there's something i need to see it had that snazzy-looking retro box too and i was in a happy mood so i gladly went home and popped it in br br this must have been the cheeriest movie i'd seen in years it made me think of bringing up baby it was so happy and that's a good thing by the way kate beckinsale is absolutely charming the american guy is lots of fun and the english guy has the great sense to be charming and insanely cute in that odd way that the british have the movie has a plot sure but it doesn't matter you should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that english guy's striped t-shirt it's the best pick-me-up since bounty or you know whatever by the way i warn you after i saw it i caught myself singing that dionne warwick song for weeks afterwards
