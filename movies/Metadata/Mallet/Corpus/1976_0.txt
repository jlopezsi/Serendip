spoiler alert br br i was not excited when i learned of the show coming to television but after they closed off the initial story arc and continued with new material it took off and had the potential to be a great series separating the crow as an alternate entity was brilliant and having shelly remaining on the bridge to the afterworld held the original premise of the show br br also demascos was terrific as eric he maintained the look branden lee originated and also made the martial arts natural and well-integrated into the action sequences br br i only wish the series would get released in dvd so i could see the episodes again
