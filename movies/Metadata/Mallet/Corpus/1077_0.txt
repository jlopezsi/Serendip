however being that heinlein was one of the few sci-fi authors i didn't read i'm more of an asimov and bradbury fan myself as a kid growing up and i haven't seen the original film i didn't have any problems with this movie when it came out in theaters in fact i found the premise genuinely creepy the effects highly believable and the presence of donald sutherland to be a masterful touch it may not go down in the all-time pantheon of greatest sci-horror films ever but if it was playing on hbo i wouldn't change the channel sometimes i think people get too caught up in whether a story is true to the original and forget that it's just a movie and they should try to enjoy it on that basis
