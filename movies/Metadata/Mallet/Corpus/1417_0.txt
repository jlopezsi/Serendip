lugosi and karloff are perfect together there are three movies that these two have important roles but this is the only one where their roles are of equal importance in the invisible ray karloff dominates in the raven it is lugosi br br the script seems to be storyboarded to take advantage of their accents one time when the rather ingenuous romantic lead david manners uh dismisses a morbid theory as superstitious baloney to which lugosi breaking up an ordinary line into an orchestration of musical syllables replies superstitious perhaps baloney perhaps not each of the five words underlined by a little shift in facial expression br br in the same sequence karloff explaining the fear that has caused lugosi to throw a knife at and kill a cat delivers a beautifully spoken monologue about the extreme form of the phobia ended it by saying that lugosi suffers from an all-consuming horror of cats his perfect diction adds to the effectiveness of the lines the word horror is emphasized given a menacing intonation while a pause and a lift of the eyes upwards in a mock-religious expression a slight hissing in the final sound gives the ordinary phrase of cats a genuinely frightening connotation br br this is one of the best horror movies of the early thirties karloff is evil yet magnetic and lugosi's hero is sympathetic and well-intentioned but also callous and overtaken by some far less admirable traits 10/10<br br
