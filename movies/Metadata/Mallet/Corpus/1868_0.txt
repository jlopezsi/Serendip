for me the ending was the point of the entire movie that in fact we are misled through the whole movie by the fact the her son is sick and there's the healer so we all think that the healer is healing her son and that's where we are wrong he is a healer and the person he was meant to heal was her not the boy br br her son get's sick yes but why do we the living automatically think that the best thing is for him to survive if you look at the mother in the beginning when she just finds out her son is ill and dying you can see that she is in no condition to let go especially because she has no source of comfort with her husband just having cheated on her we even see her begging her son to not die so she's willing to fight tooth and nail for her son to live but also in a way for her soul and spirit to survive that is where the healer comes in and also maybe why he is able to spot her in that huge crowd as someone needing him not because of her son but perhaps even unknownst to him because healing her is going to require more from him than he's ever given before br br look also at the way she goes about her relationship with the healer it's not your average affair she's forgiven her husband and is not doing it to spite him and tells him about alexai she even admits to not understanding it and on alexai's side if you look at the fact that whenever he heals someone it takes something out of him this was his biggest healing mission ever because to do it he had to give up his life as he knew it without knowing the reason why but just by following his instinct and what he feels he was called to do he has sex for the first time impregnates her and then it completely makes sense that when her son's illness comes back alexai's healing powers are gone because that was never what he was meant to do br br he healed that family and specifically the mother by healing her spirit enough for her to let go of her son and in the end she is able she let's him go and doesn't beg him to stay for her sake like she did before it's brilliantly written because it challenges what we think we know about dying and living and most of all it illustrates the immense power of spiritual healing
