a marvelous movie from start to just before the finish br br we meet robert montgomery and helen hayes with whom he has eloped recently on shipboard she is eager to start their home life together all he can think of is seeing his mother br br louise closser hale is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family the other members including henry travers and margaret hamilton are very good as well especially fine is john beal as montgomery's nephew indeed he gives a heart-wrenching performance it's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition br br montgomery is not only a mama's boy called vicky by everyone as his name is victor he is also a supreme narcissist in one shocking scene he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that hayes has lovingly worked on sculpting he doesn't even notice it br br it's very hard to fault this movie the ending is a trifle disappointing and a mark twain aphorism is spoken by one character and laughed at by others as if it were original to this screenplay br br hayes is superb and very likable montgomery not generally a favorite of mine is believable as her self-centered husband beal is absolutely superb in a very touching role and hale is subtle but compelling as the woman of iron who becomes an invalid the minute doing so will get what she wants from her offspring
