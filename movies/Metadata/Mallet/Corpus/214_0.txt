ring 0 is the japanese prequel to the ring mythos br br where sadako yamamura is early in her college experience and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater and her romantic life she is cursed and is generally unaware when this seemingly multiple personality takes over her being in this shakespearean tragedy of a film that leaves one wishing it could have ended differently br br truly a masterpiece which inspired me to submit a sort of comical comic strip parody to a ring 0 art contest last year where i won third place which was pretty exciting you can see the finished comic on the website's media page br br everything about this movie is well made from the directing to the mood to the mystery to the acting that draws you in and makes you feel for the characters and hope for a resolution br br yukie deserves high accolades for this movie and even though she never won an award for it she won one from me
