i'm a sucker for werewolf movies and when i saw the dvd cover of werewolf hunter that and its title had me picking it up asap i read the back and knew then that it wasn't a straight up werewolf movie but it still sounded interesting so i got it br br the movie is based on true events of a serial killer named romasanta he was caught tried for killing 15 people in 1852 he claimed to have hunted them down as a wolf werewolf and had hunted many times with a man called anonia who was also a werewolf blah blah blah he was sentence to life instead of death and died in captivity br br now the movie takes a different approach to the the above events but most of the characters are there romasanta and anonia i was afraid the movie would try to trick you into thinking he was really a werewolf or leave you with questions but it didn't it took you through a nice recreation of the original events with some decent added story br br if you like horror thrillers not a bad rent
