we recently saw swimmers at the waterfront film festival it's a lovely take on the dysfunction that roils beneath the surface of many if not all families in one form or another the story centers on a five-person family as told through the eyes of its youngest member an 11 year-old girl the characters and motivations of the mother father daughter and one of her brothers are very well-developed as is that of an unrelated woman that comes to their small maryland coastal town with some baggage of her own the story plays beautifully its underlying tensions coming to a head near the end of the film thought-provoking my husband and i were talking about it hours after we'd seen it we hope this film gets picked up and distributed
