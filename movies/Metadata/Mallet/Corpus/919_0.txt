spoilers within br br i just watched this again and it occurred to me that it still works in 2007 if anything the premise is even more believable now than it was 26 years ago in that sense it was a pretty darn accurate bit of future prediction in terms of where our video and computer technology was going br br i've always liked this movie it stands as a classic underrated film and a fond memory of my childhood i took two points off though one for each of the two problems i have with it br br first they didn't provide enough motivation or explanation for killing the models one of them seemed to have figured out what was really going on so that makes sense but the others was it just to avoid paying out their contracts they made a point of saying how rich the ri company was so the cost would seem to be trivial in comparison to murder br br second it struck me as odd that they could accurately digitize human beings but they still shot the commercials on a real set that doesn't make a lot of sense even today it's much easier to model a kitchen than it is to model a human being br br overall though it's still a solid and enjoyable flick you could make this movie today and it would be a perfectly good film for 2007
