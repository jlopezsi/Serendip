what is the best feature at disney mgm?together with indiana jones is star tours the great simulator of star wars you are in a strange fusion of bus and spaceship.the cool thing is that the simulator is very realistic and loyal to star wars saga so you can sense a great speed when you enter hyperspace or when you are evading laser shots at the death star the bus is controlled by r2 and a droid called rx-1138 or just rex a troublesome droid who makes many mistakes during the film like entering an ice asteroid but afteralls star tours is perfect just like star wars br br 10
