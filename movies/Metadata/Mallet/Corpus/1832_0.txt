in the 1950s 2 very critically acclaimed russian films were made the first film was the cranes are flying by mikhail kolotozov it is true that it was a good film but it was more of a love story if there is a film which all human beings must watch it is ballad of a soldier made by the great russian cin√©aste grigori chukrai i still have vivid memories of this film although i saw it in 1986 on india's only public television network called doordarshan what i like the most about this film is that it has tremendous emotional power to move anyone regardless of that person's ideologies or beliefs it talks of war without begging for kindness mercy or pity such is the greatness of this masterpiece in my opinion ballad of a soldier is not only the greatest russian film ever made it is one of the greatest world cinema gems too for those who have not yet seen it one word of advice throw away all your hollywood flicks and watch this humanist masterpiece ps 10 out of 10 is a understatement ballad of a soldier would easily fetch 100 out of 10
