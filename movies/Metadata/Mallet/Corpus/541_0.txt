i've been anticipating this film for a while since it is thora birch's first role since american beauty so the hole the hole has been hyped up as a horror/psychological film in which 4 students are locked down an old wartime bunker the hole to avoid a boring geography field trip how does it fare br br the casting is probably the jewel of this film it's superb the absolutely stunning keira knightley sab from star wars episode i appears as liz's birch friend frankie all the rest of the characters are complete unknowns except the psychologist played by embeth davidtz matilda bridget jones schindler's list but they all act their parts excellently br br this film really has the british feel mastered the sets are excellent the locations are splendid and the whole feel of the movie is very realistic the school really does feel like a british public school a british public school is like a private school in the us one where you need rich parents to flash to get you in the unnamed pupils seem extremely realistic br br there are only three small flaws with this film the first is that it doesn't exactly live up to the hype in the british press i did not find this scary at all but it was an extremely well done mystery/whodunnit horror nah not unless you classify psychological thrillers as horror br br the second flaw is that the transitions between different parts of the film can be rather confusing often the film bounds around past and present shots and be extremely disorienting in places unlike memento this disorientation is not an advantage however at the end of the film you'll be able to tie all of the parts together and leave feeling quite satisfied with the story a bit like the film wild things br br another minor let down is the music totally forgettable has no place in the film and it often appears at the most inappropriate times br br i really do hope this is released in the usa soon as thora birch is definitely not to be missed here and i think the stunning keira knightley is going to be getting some bigger roles from now on she's definitely earned her stripes here so my big question why has this not been scheduled for us release br br this is certainly not a blair witch project clone although this impression has been given by the press instead this is a cleverly constructed and extremely well casted psychological thriller/mystery
