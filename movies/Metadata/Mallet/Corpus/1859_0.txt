lady snowblood isn't the most widely known samurai film in the international movie market but it is certainly worth a viewing particularly for those into samurai/swordsplay pictures i just checked it out randomly because i thought the female swordsperson angle might be interesting but i had no real expectations i was surprised to find a stylish film with a solid story which can actually be unpredictable at times adequate action sequences spruced up by heavily stylized blood spurts and good acting particularly from the female lead the film balances the sadness of lady snowblood's story and some campy humor to great affect some may be turned off by the latter part particularly if they fail to see it as intentional i loved the bit for example when a villain explains to a radical left-wing writer his business of the last few years exactly in the exaggerated fashion that a radical left-wing reporter would be inclined to write about a tyrannical bureaucrat this movie would be well viewed by samurai film aficionados and people interested in gender roles in cinema
