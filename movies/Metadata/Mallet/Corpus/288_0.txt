one of the weaker entries in the drummond series but it's still entertaining perhaps i've seen too many of the drummond films too close together the humor is not as sharp as earlier entries the pacing is fine but the plot and villains don't seem to be up to snuff the villains don't appear evil or sharp enough to harm a fly let alone our hero br br there is a nice sequence of that wonderful 30s lab equipment working its magic so much more exciting and dramatic than computer chips and leds now that's evil
