this was a very engaging film about a guy who murders his cheating wife and then is released from prison 8 years later you really find yourself rooting for him especially when he meets and saves the life of a lady you really want them to get together the problem is he is so afraid to open up to people that he distances himself from her and chooses to confide more in his pet eel it seems that if he does connect to someone on a deeper level he's afraid he might kill again though he is clearly a decent person who snapped one time in his life and only after being pushed it's a great character study and the acting and direction are marvelous with a few lapses here and there what didn't i like well it isn't so much the acting that's the problem but the script repeatedly flashbacks and psychotic-like hallucinations occur they tend to muddle the basic message and confuse the plot without these and without the large amounts of blood in the murder scene this would have gotten a rating of 9 or even 10
