i found the cast to be very good mr lane was exceptional as were other members of the cast i must say that it was in my opinion as his best movie he has done i have seen this movie many times from this my interest in him has grown his character max prince reminded me of his true character serious yet entertaining i personally would like to see the play for this movie as i have heard that the cast were different to the ones in the movie this would probably allow me to judge which was more superior i must agree with the fact that the music could have been chosen better as to could be said of the location my recommendation would be chicago or new york
