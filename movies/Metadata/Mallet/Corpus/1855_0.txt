it was the 1962 kurosawa movie sanjuro i believe that first introduced the geyser blood special effect to the world but 11 years later toshiya fujita's lady snowblood developed this image to a fine art in this latter film we meet yuki kashima born for vengeance in a japanese woman's prison in 1874 trained from childhood to avenge the deaths of her mother father and brother by 1894 armed only with a sword hidden in her parasol handle she is ready to exact retribution from the three killers still living all three of these confrontations between yuki and her enemies are uh executed marvelously all are suspenseful action packed and surprising and all feature those geysers jets gouts streams and sprays of the red stuff mentioned above yes this is a very gory movie let's just say that yuki's kimonos never seem to stay lily white for very long but it is also a very beautiful one exquisitely filmed and often featuring gorgeous seaside or garden backdrops the picture is actually very artful and poetic as reflected in some of its chapter titles such as crying bamboo dolls of the netherworlds and umbrella of blood heart of strewn flowers meiko kaji plays the part of yuki with great intensity she makes yuki a gorgeous instrument of vengeance whose skill with the blade really is something to behold and her final moments on screen are quite moving thus lady snowblood gives us a compelling story strong action and great visual beauty it would be a perfect picture i'd say if only the anachronistic jazz in the background didn't occasionally pop up an obvious inspiration for tarantino's kill bill the film is certainly deserving of a wider audience and thanks to the widescreen dvd from animeigo that i just watched with excellent subtitling crisp images and many fine extras that audience now has a chance to discover this winning entertainment in a perfect form
