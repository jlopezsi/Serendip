the original blues brothers is one of my favorite movies so although i didn't expect bb2000 to be as good there is no way i expected to be so bad the beginning was decent and the new characters were for the most part acceptable but the further into the movie you go the worse it gets until finally you get into flying characters and voodoo witches neither of which in my opinion belongs in a blues brothers movie however the music is excellent so instead of renting or buying the movie opt for the soundtrack
