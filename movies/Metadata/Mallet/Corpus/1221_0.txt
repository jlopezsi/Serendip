different is probably the word that will spring to mind after a viewing of inner sanctum it's unusual in its choice of milieu and subject matter even its choices within that subject matter unusual in its slapdash mixture of tone and acting styles even unusual in its length of merely 52 minutes it also leaves viewers in an unusual disarray of responses br br the film's most horrifying moment is its very first a man charles russell stabs a woman on a railroad siding and dumps her body like a sack of meal on the observation platform as the train pulls out alas a bratty little boy dale belding is hanging around the tracks this stormy night and witnesses some of this since russell doesn't know how much he tries but fails to silence the kid with a crowbar br br the storm has washed out roads and bridges in the pacific northwest so russell hitches a ride to a town so little that there's no hotel only a rooming house where it turns out the meddlesome boy lives with his harried mother the wonderful lee patrick midpoint between the maltese falcon and caged another resident mary beth hughes spots that rarity an unattached slab of male flesh and comes at him in sections to get him to take her away to san francisco but russell like a cunning beast of prey only has eyes for the kid br br in its crummy look the sets consist of the railroad siding the boarding house and a back-lot park and creepy story as well as in its ultimate surrender to an all-powerful and malevolent fate inner sanctum most resembles edgar g ulmer's detour of three years earlier but lew landers doesn't quite have ulmer's touch or for that matter ann savage the movie also recalls detour in that it seems to have been cobbled into coherence from footage already shot once the meagre budget ran out br br so the final scene is a reprise of the one that opens it and both of them stand as gargoyle-bookends to the story that they frame at the end however the murder is prefaced by a cautionary tale even a prophecy told to a young woman on the train by an old blind traveler whose last words are don't get off the train the tale of course is the movie we have just watched evoking an ever-repeating inescapable loop of fate
