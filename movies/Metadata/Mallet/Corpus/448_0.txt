the interesting thing about the fearless freaks is the difference between the style of brad beesley's film-making and the production process of the lips albums wayne coyne's music is weird yes even chaotic but it is carefully put together and endlessly tweaked elevating the raw elements of songwriting guitar chords sung melody into a mesmerizing digital orchestra of sorts beesley's documentary however is satisfied with gritty hand-held 16mm footage of usually coyne pontificating it's odd that such futuristic unconventional music-making would make such good source material for old-school back-to-basics film-making the most interesting part of this documentary rather than the heroin scene with steven drozd is wayne revisiting his old long john silver's and enlisting two young children to reenact a robbery which launches him into a spiel about the rather un-poetic reality of death it like the rest of the film is an incredible snapshot of some true oddballs in the american music scene
