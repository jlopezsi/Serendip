elaborate star-studded movie about a jewel thief joan crawford falling in love with a man she's supposed to rob or something like that br br this is a horrible movie just one of the worst i've ever seen it is beautiful to look at has a great cast and they all give great performances especially crawford she's gorgeous and letter perfect in her role br br then why do i hate this so much the dialogue and plot the plot is as old as the hills and the script is chock-full of totally unbelievable dialogue that no human being would ever utter virtually every other line was so bewildering that i could not get into the characters or the story also the film is very static it feels very much like a stage play filmed and it's very very slow and dull<br br maybe i shouldn't judge the film as it is i tried to watch it twice and fell asleep both times i made it through an hour and then dozed off i think the stupid dialogue kept me awake for that long br br this film was unavailable for some reason from the 1960s to the early 1980s unfortunately it's now out there do yourself a favor if you're a crawford fan like i am don't see this it's really terrible
