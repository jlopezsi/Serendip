i gave this a ten in a futile attempt to up the average br br it would be a shame if a 6.5 score put people off watching this film i would rate it 7-8 quite happily it is one of the few films released over the last few years that gives me belly laughs throughout and after repeat viewings br br nathan lane is especially good and after this film i became a big fan br br perhaps the homosexual themes put people off yes the characters are stereotypes and it doesn't try to make many serious points but i'd like to think that the open minded are in for an undervalued treat br br how do i feel about the rating i don't know betrayed bewildered
