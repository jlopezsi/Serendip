i saw this movie for the first time at the philadelphia film festival in 2004 and i was amazed at how funny this movie was it is a dramatic comedy where three friends are trying to figure out what to do with their lives and each other the characters are all in their late 20's and the main character is about to turn 30 and is dealing with a lost job and newfound love ah what to do what to do as friendship is a key element to this story there are plenty of moments of humor and awkwardness that will perhaps be familiar to many without spoilers thats about all i can say but trust me it's worth the watch its very hard to find the dvd but you can find it region free online but takes some searching
