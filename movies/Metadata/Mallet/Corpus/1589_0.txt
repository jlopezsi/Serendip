i love old hollywood movies they are so elegiac elegant and sweet bette davis and henry fonda are real winners of this antebellum novel so sweet but so threateningly looming as the news of the forthcoming civil war is spread all the time in the film and the peaceful routine is soon to be rudely interrupted by the horrible conflict of two cultures and two worlds bette as miss julia is so natural so open and easy-going that she seems a bit shocking even in this spoiled time her lover enemy bride-not-to-be is a yankee and their conflict is deeper than a usual love hate relation this is a looming war between north and south between two world two sets of ideals and likes this film is great at showing the lazy southern society with its black servants white masters pre-war sentiments clashes and classes gone with the wind may be grander on a general scale but this one is so intimately sweet that it is highly recommended for all who are interested in the civil war times
