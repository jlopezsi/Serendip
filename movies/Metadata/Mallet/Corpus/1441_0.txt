i recently saw this film during the usa film festival in dallas the usaff's new program director mentioned it was her personal favorite of the festival i can see why although there is no dialogue in the film the director's visuals tell a tale all their own the film is beautiful to look at with sharp colors haunting music and amazing poetic images the emotional pull of the actors makes the story both fascinating and moving this is definitely not a typical film it is unique mysterious and moving yet simple and elegant it feels both gentle and brutal a very emotional experience this director's first film is a stunning accomplishment i wish i could see more films like this it's truly beautiful
