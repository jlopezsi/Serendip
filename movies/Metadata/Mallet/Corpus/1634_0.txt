i was lucky enough to see this little slice of film crime noir at the lacma during the weekly tuesday matin√©e and let me tell you but for all the old ladies and grandpas in the theater i felt i had been transported back to the golden age of los angeles film noir this title ranks up there with white heat as one of the best crime thrillers using the city of angels as its locale after renting kubrick's the killing on dvd i jumped at the chance to see another heist film with sterling hayden in my opinion the meanest s.o.b noir actor he is awesome as usual in this movie with his characteristic scowl frozen on his face also for a film made half a century ago it has remarkably stood up to the test of time quite well it's really a lean mean little crime thriller please whoever owns the rights to this gem release this forgotten classic on dvd you still have the chance to release a 50th anniversary edition this year
