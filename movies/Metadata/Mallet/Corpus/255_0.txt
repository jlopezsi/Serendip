a funny version of the classic comedy based on the 1978 foreign film extravaganza la cage aux folles that was then made into a tony award winning musical in 1983 of the same title the great mike nichols takes the helm with the help of a off the wall script from the multi-talented elaine may the film stars robin williams in a rare straight comedic performance as a father who finds that his son is getting married and has to transform has male lover nathan lane who is convinced he is a she anyway into a he to appease his fiance and her parents including an ultra conservative politician played by gene hackman when the two families get together it equals nonstop laughs thanks to the out of this world performance by golden globe nominee lane as albert it doesn't have the polish and timing that the foreign classic has but if foreign films aren't your game then this one is good for you and it works for me diane wiest co-stars
