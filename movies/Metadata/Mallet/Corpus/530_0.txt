its nice to see the teen thriller/horror genre being experimented with by the brits for once.this is being touted as the brit blair witch and while its certainly not that its an incredibly enjoyable night out the cast are surprisingly good thora birch is a talented lead and the other 3 newcomers are very promising after the first scene and the following horrific flashbacks audience expectations are very high for a truly terrifying film on this level the film doesn't deliver unlike the blair witch this isn't that scary it jumpy violent and memorable yet not scary the premise is great and ingeniously explored through uneven flashbacks and the film is nicely directed with some flair the film also has a clever twist which is deliciously nasty overall this is much better than a lot of the crap that the americans get away with and this deserves to do well a thoroughly entertaining film which will guarantee your undivided attention 8/10
