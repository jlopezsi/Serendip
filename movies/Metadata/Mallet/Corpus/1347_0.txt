one of the more enjoyable fun films i've seen in a while excess baggage left me with a smile on my face del toro seemed a little uncomfortable on screen and it's always hard to see harry connick jr trying to play a bad guy but silverstone was wonderfully bratty without overdoing it and christopher walken served up yet another delightful performance as the problem solver br br the scene in the garage/warehouse with all of the exotic stolen cars the bad guys and good ol ray walken with a gun was simply priceless br br don't look for anything heavy here just kick back relax and have some fun and enjoy the film for what it is
