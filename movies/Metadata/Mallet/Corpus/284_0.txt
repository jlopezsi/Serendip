an mgm pete smith short subject br br a very silly housewife receives help with her dinner menu and a cure for her hubby's upset tummy when a chef magically arrives in her kitchen br br this fanciful little film is an enjoyable bit of early technicolor fluff the practical demonstrations mixed up with the gentle humor serve up a most pleasing result almost as appetizing as the roast duck baked apples movie mavens will recognize franklin pangborn as the dyspeptic husband una merkel as his featherbrained wife and luis alberni as the remarkable chef all uncredited br br off-the-wall narrator pete smith would produce a reworked version of this story with oscar winning results four years later in penny wisdom 1937 br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios feature films
