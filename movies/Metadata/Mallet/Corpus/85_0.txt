let me say straight away that this movie is toxic waste for the mind this movie is not watchable because it has a good story it doesn't it's not watchable because there's good acting there is none it's watchable because of the cast this will take you down tv memory lane how many former tv stars can you pick out br br as with any tv movie of the week the drawing power is in the stars the story involves the inaugural flight of maiden one the first supersonic transport plane the movie ignores the fact that it was a british-french conglomerate that first built the concorde and had to sue for the right to land in america during this time in this movie we have a disgruntled worker who sabotages the flight by putting detergent in the hydraulic lines in order to get revenge on his boss burgess meredith br br we also have doug mcclure trying to get back into tina louise's pants billy crystal playing a rather fey steward john delancie in training for his future role as q and peter graves as one half of a former may-december romance did i mention that there also happens to be a plot line about the airplane carrying the senegal flu which is now spreading among the crew if you don't have sabotage you've got the untamed strain of flu floating around br br there are two references that date this movie one is a reference to the swine flu the other is the way that burt convy discusses abortion with his bimbo girlfriend the concept is mentioned but she won't let him say the word br br the movie does have a reverse natural selection the megastars like meredith graves die but losers like convy mcclure etc live to make another bad tv movie check out the cameo of regis philbin and his hair as an annoying tv reporter br br sterno says sst death flight is a guilty pleasure
