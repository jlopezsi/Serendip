tiger blade is one of the worst action movies i ever saw the plot is non existent it's so full of holes that i lost interest about 10 minutes into the film so at least there are good fight scenes no special effects are cheap it's all a rehash of previous films notably matrix but with inferior quality br br everything sucks in this movie lousy acting totally boring this flick is an insult to the viewer avoid br br sometimes the absence of a plot is preferable to a really crappy one take the doom video games for instance who cares why you're there as long as there are aliens to shoot
