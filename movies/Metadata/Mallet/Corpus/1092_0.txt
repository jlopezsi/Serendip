twins separated at birth meet again blah blah<br br but it's fun to watch and you get to see jackie chan's hilariously imaginative fight scenes br br with a couple of babes thrown in and the inadvertent swapping of partners from one twin to the other you can but tempt to imagine the glorious fun that results this is jackie at his silly best a dignified world-famous conductor in one role whilst a bumbling bad-ass mechanic in the other we get to see how versatile if unique an actor he is br br for much of the film both twins keep meddling in each other's lives causing havoc and confusion without knowing the cause until finally they come face to face br br i saw it 10 years ago several times because of its watchability the soundtrack was excellent i still remember some of the tunes now br br feeling down need a lift this flick will rejuvenate your spirit for open-hearted fun living br br 9/10
