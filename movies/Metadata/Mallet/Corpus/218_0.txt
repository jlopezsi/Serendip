the original ringu 1998 is a truly creepy modern-day japanese horror classic its sequel ringu 2 1999 is a sometimes confusing anticlimax of sorts but still quite fun nevertheless and in ringu 0 2000 the prequel to the original we get to see the face of sadako yamamura heretofore mostly hidden behind long stringy hair and as played by actress yukie nakama it is quite a lovely face indeed we also get to discover some of sadako's back story and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape we see her as a woman of around 20 an aspiring actress in a dramatic troupe and all seems to go well with her until her otherworldly powers begin to manifest themselves and her fellow thespians start to drop faster than victims of tsutsugamushi disease compared to carrie white in the 1976 film carrie sadako is far nastier and just like in that earlier film all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout ringu 0 is a fairly slow-moving film and a surprise revelation concerning sadako that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow but since it effectively doubles the sadako quotient why quibble sadako is certainly a fascinating character and the film's final 1/2 hour does repay the slow buildup coming full circle closing the ring the film culminates with the terrible act of attempted murder that we partially witnessed in the original ringu and fans of the series will perhaps understand me when i say that um all's well that ends well
