this was about to be one of the most awesomely sh1tty movies ever made your generic run of the mill horror movie plot dumb partying teens the evil clown and that one dude from heroes that i hate but the acting was really pretty acceptable and the script wasn't nearly as bad as you'd think there was some sort of weird political subtext that was a bit obnoxious but it didn't seem to hurt things too badly the beginning was a bit malibu's most wanted for my taste ie really dumb wigger jokes but that passed all in all it has some awesomely cheesy moments and i'd say this is a must see for all fans of really bad horror movies
