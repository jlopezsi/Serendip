in addition to being my absolute favorite cd last year 1 giant leap is an extraordinary cinematic achievement it is an ambitious project that travels the world collecting inspirational music images and insights from musicians poets writers philosophers etc br br the contributors include some of my all-time favorite artists michael franti baba maal brian eno speech michael stipe among others if you are a fan of world music and the blending of ancient and contemporary sounds this is a can't-miss br br this film is really unlike anything else i've ever seen before and it opens up a whole new genre of documentary/performance film i am so impressed with the vision and execution of the two producer/director/composer/editors who made the film they are truly talented individuals br br my only criticism would be that the film is not edited in a seamless way from beginning to end so that at certain points in the film it abruptly goes to black until you select the next dvd chapter that said it shouldn't discourage anyone from exploring this intriguing dvd and don't forget to check out the soundtrack
