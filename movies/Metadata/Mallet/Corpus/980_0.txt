it is a quite slow pace face-to-face brynner/douglas i found there was some pretty heavy violence/gore but you know seventies giallo style maybe some spoiler ahead a little bit phony and fake but the image is there the monkey torn apart the flesh torn from the mechanic etc br br i don't remember if it is alike the novel but overall i think it is a ok action flick hero flick he stands all alone at the end all the bad guys are out br br and nice images too a small rocky island the sun over the sea<br br but not a typical verne's story-on-cinema subs sci-fi but the adventure seen in a lot of verne's novels tough
