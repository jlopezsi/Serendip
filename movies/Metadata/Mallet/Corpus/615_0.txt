i started watching this in high school and it used to pass the time now with tivo i watch 6 soaps y&r atwt gh oltl amc dool out of all the soaps days is definitely the worst by far it's uneventful boring and slow really naive and repetitive story lines they drag nonsense out for months and even years sometimes i literally fast forward every episode to the point that it takes me a minute to understand the point of the whole episode it's just dreadful i was so excited that the dimera storyline finally ended years ago but now it's back why the dimera storyline is so horrible and boring and unrealistic days really needs to pay attention to general hospital and see what a soap can do it can be fast-paced and engaging
