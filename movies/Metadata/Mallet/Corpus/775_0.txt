i actually grew up near the city of belem shown in the beginning of the movie and spent 18 years in the region i also spent time in many of the indian tribes in the area including being adopted into one at the age of five br br the movie does a great job of showing many aspects of life in the jungle including some of the lawlessness the costumes are fairly authentic and portrayal of many tribal customs is well done the manhood ceremony is closely based on authentic ceremonies that happen in most tribes br br altogether about as good as you can expect from something that is not intended to be a documentary
