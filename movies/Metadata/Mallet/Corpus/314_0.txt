contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas this film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money br br the greatest thing in screamers is that there is a message in it it's just a way the real art should be it should make people think dream use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information and i think not many expensive hollywood productions especially sci-fi are successful in this regard br br so for instance the idea that someone who looks human can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say who's who judging from their appearance or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war which was forgotten by the governments who started it blood is cheaper than raw materials this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today br br in my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good it's just a good story an appropriate atmosphere and some really well done acting to make it good and in my opinion screamers has all these elements
