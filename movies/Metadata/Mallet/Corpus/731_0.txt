i saw this movie in the early 80s on-board a navy ship we had little choice in our movie selections i currently watch between 10-20 movies a week to this day i haven't seen anything even the legendary films of ed wood that is as bad as this film in one scene near the end of the film there were close-ups of national guard troops preparing their weapons these were ww ii era bolt action rifles at a close up of one of the troops pulling back on the bolt to load the rifle you do not see anything going into the breach and those eyes of the title character i think the makeup was purchased from the nearest dollar store this film is only recommended for those individuals who enjoy watching the worst films ever made
