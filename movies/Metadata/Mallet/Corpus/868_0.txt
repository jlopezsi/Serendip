i was impressed with the modern gadgets br br i think that the premise that in the future the internet will have to be policed is a compelling idea the movie did lack character development in some areas but the acting and action was well done i also thought that scott bakula did a really wonderful job as always br br i have never read the tom clancy novel netforce but perhaps that was for the best usually movies made using novels as the basis end up feeling like tin foil seeing this movie without having read the novel i felt the story was complete the storyline was interesting and without holes
