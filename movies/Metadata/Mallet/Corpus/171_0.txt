this movie is a testament to the power of love orson welles portrays a wwii vet who will not allow himself to ruin his wife's new life as i watched the scene where he denies his true identity i was awestruck by the sacrifice he made the scene in which he met and spoke with his son was so touching this is an awesome must-see for orson welles fans also the casting of a young richard long and a very young natalie wood was a stroke of genius
