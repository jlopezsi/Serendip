i saw this movie years ago as a 13 year old and i can say without exaggeration that no other movie has had such a strong and lasting impact on me while i was aware of the sacrilege going on in the amazon this opened my eyes to it like never before shortly after this i ran away from home with a friend with the intention of going to brazil mobilising the indians into a guerrilla band and killing the loggers it took our families all of two days to track us down at a port city br br but i never forgot the lesson this movie taught me and today i work for a conservation organisation some of the indian quotes from the movie are truly tear jerkers when we were young the end of the world(the limits of the forest was very far away but it gets closer and closer each day or something to that effect as an idealistic kid i saw no flaw in this movie and cheered at the improbable climax where the rains destroy the dam and the captured indian women throw away their cheap clothes and return to the forest this movie is a must watch
