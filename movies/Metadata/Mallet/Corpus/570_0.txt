drive thru is a very deranged comedy that seems like it was directed by some pothead like danny leiner.surprisingly it's not a bad movie.it has it's share of blood gore violence and what horror movie like this one wouldn't have any humor?it's like eight legged frieks and tremors except the killer is not a giant spider or an underground worm.i watched this movie for free on fearnet on demand a year ago just to see if it was any good.for 83 minutes i sat through which appeared to be a dumb horror movie yet a somewhat smart comedy.if you enjoy movies about killer clowns who butcher people then drive thru is on the menu.would you like some blood with your order
