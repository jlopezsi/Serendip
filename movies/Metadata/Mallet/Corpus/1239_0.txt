this movies bad the worst part was after the long chase near end where the evil black dodge takes a nose dive off a cliff to its death then it comes back seconds later in near perfect running condition only to drive off again this time into a box of explosives its like the people who made this movie had an extra dodge laying around and wanted to get rid of it wheels of terror is only worth watching for a laugh
