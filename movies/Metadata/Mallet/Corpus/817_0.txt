the basic story idea for la moustache is unique and intrigued me a seemingly insignificant action occurs and then a man's entire existence changes this occurs when the lead on a whim shaves off his mustache oddly his wife didn't notice nor did his friends at first it's no big deal but later the man becomes angry how could they be so self-absorbed that they didn't notice or care oddly when confronted they have no recollection that he had one even though the audience saw he had one and saw pictures of the man with the mustache this part of the film was interesting and pulled me in very well br br however out of the blue the man disappears to hong kong and from then on the plot really makes no sense at all at first i thought i'd missed something when the film ended there were just too many dangling plot points and things that just confused me so i watched the making of featurette on the dvd and one of the main characters confided that she read the script and she was also confused and it made no sense some people might like this and normally i don't mind a film that leaves unanswered questions but this goes way beyond this to just confusing and well stupid it took a film that might have earned a 7 or 8 and made it at best a 4 br br decent acting but a bad script sink this film but like so many sub-par films the dvd case made it sound amazing and worthwhile with phrases like a paranoid thriller in the manner of alfred hitchcock or a mini-masterwork yeah right the film had little to do with hitchcock's style and comparisons to hitchcock are a dime a dozen many of chabrol's films even his bad ones are also often compared to hitchcock's and i'm getting sick of this disingenuous advertising one of the very few films that might really deserve this comparison is the original les diaboliques in contrast la moustache seemed about as hitchcockian as mission impossible iii
