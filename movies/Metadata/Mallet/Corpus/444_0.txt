i bought this terrible flick suspecting it was a grade c movie but might be good for a laugh or two br br i was surprised it was a d movie and full of stupid remarks forgettable characters a plot that had an intelligent person written the screen play might have worked br br how such worthless trashy flicks get the bucks to be produced much less consumed by what must be children and adults with learning disabilities i don't know br br the lack of imagination in how the invaders invade is depressing they're all humans who have been killed but somehow their bodies taken over by the invaders i was unable to waste enough time to see this thing to its end br br other commenters may help here
