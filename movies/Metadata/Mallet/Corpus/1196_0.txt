the best thing about starquest 2 or galactic odyssey or whatever was definitely the ed tomney soundtrack i was intrigued by the appearance of adam baldwin who made a lasting impression on me during his run on the classic firefly tv series though the acting isn't too bad nobody could have saved this film br br this is an extremely low budget sci-fi film with a lot more ambition than ability this film is about a group of humans that wake up to find themselves aboard an alien spaceship monitored by video cameras which double as weapons and being carted off to an unknown destination for an unknown purpose they are arranged in opposite sex pairs which might have given any intelligent primates some clue about the aliens purpose but never mind there aren't any intelligent primates to be found there is a lot of shouting fighting and sex and it appears that some of the humans are in fact aliens no sense in continuing the rest of the plot has to be seen to be disbelieved br br the basic premise is not bad but the execution and the script are off-the-scale there are too many continuity problems and absurdities to list br br more or less randomly interspersed with the main narrative are a series of war scenes which were probably found on the cutting room floor as they rarely seem to have anything to do with this film and only once show people who are actually in the film i can just imagine how this happened br br br br bartender hey it could be worse that film you're working on couldn't possibly be as bad as the one i was in br br drunken studio exec you were br br bartneder it was a kick-boxing movie and i had to fight a whole bunch of guys off for some reason never did have much of a plot they wanted me for my martial arts skills br br drunken studio exec really what was it called and when was it released br br bartender oh i don't think they bothered with a title it died in production in fact i have some of the original footage at home in my scrapbook want to check it out br br br br unfortunately the plot is too thin for a feature length film and the creators decided to fill in the gaps with randomly occurring totally unnecessary sex scenes the film would have been better as a single episode of a outer limits or the twilight zone even with the exceedingly low budget most tv franchises could have done a better job with the special effects there is nothing special about the effects in this one except for their complete lack of quality br br it would be difficult to find a reason to recommend this so i won't bother i gave it a two because it's almost harmless and therefore not as bad as a lot of what passes as entertainment these days
