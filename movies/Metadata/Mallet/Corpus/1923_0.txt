o.c stiggs is one of my favorite 80's movies i truly wish it would get issued on dvd but i realize the chances of this are remote the movie did not have too much of a plot and while i loved the liberal trashing of the extreme right-wing conservative neighbor the movie was quite mean-spirited at times it is tough to classify this film but i believe it struck a chord with me due to the anti-establishment mentality of the two lead characters br br the story centers around the two lead characters high school guys with way too much time on their hands with an affinity for the african music stylings of king sunny ade and an extreme antipathy towards the ultra-right-wing insurance agency owner who lives in their neighborhood the movie follows the two leads as they prank the family the schwabs and otherwise try to survive a record arizona heat wave by bothering as many people as they can for instance their joint purchase of the gila monster a giant monster-truck-tired old-school convertible which made more noise and belched out more smoke and fumes than any self-respecting oil refinery perhaps it was my being 16 when i first saw the movie and latching onto ti for being different and funny but hey if it ever gets re-released i will re-buy it br br the movie isn't for everyone but i enjoyed it immensely one quote in particular was worth the price of the rental back in 1988 that's the problem with insurance destruction just isn't permanent anymore and if i can ever find my old vhs copy many many friends have borrowed this tape i need to find out the title of the king sunny ade song he plays in the impromptu concert scene
