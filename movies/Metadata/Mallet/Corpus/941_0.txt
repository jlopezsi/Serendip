this is definitely one of my favorite things of all time to watch what does it for me though is the style and synchronization of the various 50's pop songs that are deliciously sprinkled throughout the movie simply fantastic they blend well with the story and its characters and you are always pleasantly surprised when a new song just pops out of someone's mouth at the sometimes most inopportune time i can't understand why it is not yet out on dvd i purchased potter's singing detective last year and i am anxiously awaiting this one someone please light a fire under the powers that be in england so that we can all enjoy this treasure in its proper format
