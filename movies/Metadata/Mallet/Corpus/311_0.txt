for you complaining about woody acting this is not a bug it is a feature it makes sense the same way it makes sense that the type three is not attacked by the screamers when you understand what it really is br br all these droids and their characters are artificial their characters are designed br br the machines who designed them have read some shakespeare it seems and watched stereotypical american warrior stories br br get it it is crappy but it is meta crappy like in total recall you are looking at traces of someone else's story within the story
