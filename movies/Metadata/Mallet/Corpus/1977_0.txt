i am an enthusiastic of foreign cinema somebody told me look over southamerica cinema since mexican movie-making has gone since time ago down the drain i was trying to find masterpieces out of spain france and asia ok i started my search with brasil and i'm tellin you i wasn't disappointed at all i was lucky to find very good movies like tieta do agreste four days in september and central do brasil i switched to argentina by advice of few friends i started with this movie burnt money supposedly historical what i found was a melodrama some good acting but mostly a lot of bad acting the set up of the period was well done but somehow the whole movie was centered in the period or in the robbery instead i attended to a disgustin gay melodrama i have nothing against homosexuallity but this movie should have been place in a different category i found it repulsive i'm gonna still try to find something better among the argentina cinema hopefully something like brasil has to offer if you want my advice ok watch any brazilian movies you won't be disappointed about argentina i don't know yet i can only tell you stay away from burnt money unless you are into gay films of course
