i really liked this movie this is not a b movie although the title is rather hokey i like the original title better but on the other hand it might not have piqued my interest if it hadn't had werewolf in the title it is a horror story and a love story the acting is above average and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story is somewhat based on a true story about a man tried and imprisoned for 15 murders in 19th century spain his defense was that he was in fact a werewolf and had no control over himself once he transformed the murders are quite gruesome the few scenes of animal abuse disturbed me more but that's just me br br if you love the genre as i do this movie is worth watching
