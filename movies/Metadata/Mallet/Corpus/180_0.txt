it's interesting to compare the hero's sacrifice in tomorrow is forever with the hero's in casablanca rick bogart leaves ilsa in casablanca to her husband for the good of the world and for a cause he believes in fighting the nazis a cause he will participate in but john/erik welles while he leaves elizabeth for the good of the same cause he fervently believes in can not participate he is crippled and sickly from the first world war he is probably emasculated as well unlike rick he can neither reveal his identity or his love for the woman he left behind even though she may know it he only says openly that the cause is all but unlike rick he is lying within himself elizabeth is the abiding passion in his life his only possibility of emotional fulfillment yet even so the world comes first and he sacrifices for this cause to the point of his own non-existence it is truly the greater sacrifice it is a wonderfully acted film which makes the lost love of john and elizabeth the most poignant i have ever shared as a movie viewer
