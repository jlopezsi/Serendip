from what i saw in looker it appears that plastic face-lift obsession was already quite noticeable in the early 80s they had no idea back then how far it would eventually go but aside from that it's still a really good movie albert finney plays a beverly hills plastic surgeon whose clients start dying in rather gruesome ways so when one particular young woman susan dey comes in for an operation he decides to keep her within his sight and finds out about some slimy deeds br br as this is a michael crichton story it of course has the problem of portraying a successful middle-aged man in love with a beautiful woman half his age but as long as we understand that it's a very enjoyable movie james coburn plays the perfect kind of ceo role he looks like a nice elderly man but what's he hiding since i don't know the partridge family and don't really have any ambition to know it i'll just remember susan dey for her role here especially that scanning scene all in all definitely worth seeing that one model at the beginning was definitely setting herself up given how she walked around in her underclothes and those pink walls were really obnoxious
