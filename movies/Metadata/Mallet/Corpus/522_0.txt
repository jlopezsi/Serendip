the hole was a very trippy movie br br i loved it i'm planning to arrange a movie night so all my friends can watch it with me that was one of the sickest things i've seen in a long time the thing about it though was it was scary just not supernaturally scary it was psychological and not macabre i didn't feel scared afterward let's just say i'll be a little more careful about my friends from now on thora birch was a grade a psycho i thought the girl looked like keira knightley i had no idea though br br it was playing on one of the movie channels and i got bored so i decided to watch it that choice has probably changed me it was an excellent movie i'm currently trying to find it on dvd
