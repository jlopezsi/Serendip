this is my first viewing so i can't start by saying it's a favorite but with joseph cotten in the romantic lead and joan fontaine with all her charm and understanding you really can't be far wrong to expect the best in a love story br br they meet on a plane flight he as an untiring industrialist who has placed business and projects before his wife and son and she as a concert pianist performing in various engagements on tour an error in flight identity has these two fine people listed on a plane that crashed and they are mistakenly presumed dead as their budding romance unfolds they both realize it's an opportunity for them to take hold of a new life together that leads to complications of course as we can expect br br i marvel at the way joan manina can reflect in her features so many subtle emotions it's as if we can hear her unspoken words the thoughts and agonies of a love that has many hurdles to overcome that is great acting in my opinion
