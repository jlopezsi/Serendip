i'm a big fan of philip k dick and so i already knew the basic story behind screamers it was based on a short story of his on seeing the film i was satisfied with the way that they managed to work around the original's cold war trappings also despite the low budget the effects were sufficiently good to suspend disbelief in fact the attention to detail surroundings back-ground odd gadgets etc was excellent as is important in all sci-fi films by creating a coherent world the movie becomes that much more convincing the performances were excellent for such a low budget and some of the lines were very quotable up there with the script of aliens if you ask me this is always an advantage however right at the end i felt a little let down by the love-scene it kind of destroyed philip k dick's message nevertheless i managed to overlook that considering how much fun it was br br this film is no classic but it's well worth a look it's really quite good
