i've pretty much seen all the classics as well as the hidden gems of the italian sub genre of giallo so what remains now are the more obscure and undiscovered gems if i'm lucky at least smile before death is such a film giallo connoisseurs have certainly heard about already but the film remains unavailable on dvd to this day and if you really want to see it you have to be satisfied with a computer ripped bootleg version with poor picture quality and unidentifiable foreign subtitles smile before death is not bad but certainly not great neither otherwise it would be wider known by now ha this isn't exactly what i would call the most exciting giallo ever made it opens promisingly enough with the murder of a middle-aged woman in a remote country estate the bedroom door was locked from the inside when they found the body and her throat was slit with a piece of glass that was found in her hand so the police close the case as suicide the teenage daughter nancy comes to the estate and befriends her mother's best friend a photographer as well as her handsome lover the initially shy nancy is quickly drawn into the sleazy world of nude modeling and the sexual affection of mature men she doesn't know however that the clue to solving her mother's dead lies with these same people and that she's actually an obstacle in the killer(s complete fiendish scheme smile before death a stylish but sadly dull and underwhelming mystery thriller apart from the murder on the mother near the beginning which is shown repeatedly and at least three times there's nothing even remotely suspenseful going on i remember from amuck the other giallo by silvio amadio that the director is more interested in the naked bodies of his lead actresses than in suspense and gruesome killing i can't say i blame him especially when working with rosalba neri but the lack of excitement here is really intolerable the theme song is great but overused and after a while i got sick and tired of staring at the young lead actress naked body that's never a good sign patient viewers will be rewarded with an acceptably entertaining albeit predictable and derivative climax but it's too late to safe the movie one of the most disappointing gialli i ever saw
