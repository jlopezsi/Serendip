i was really interested in seeing this movie because i like film noir and i like steve martin and you know what this is a very clever and affectionate homage my complaints are that the story is disappointingly convoluted so it is sometimes very hard to keep up with what is going on and one or two of the jokes don't quite work but overall it is very funny and seems to have held up well over the years the script is clever and sophisticated enough and carl reiner directs with precision and acts his part of field marshall vonkluck very well the cinematography is smooth and crisp and i thought the performances were excellent steve martin is great here not only do i think dead men don't wear plaid is underrated but this is one of his roles where martin deserves a lot more credit rachel ward looks lovely as juliet forrest and is terrific acting wise the real joy is watching the archive footage of all those wonderful actors and actresses in those timeless masterpieces spotting stars such as humphrey bogart cary grant bette davis ray milland vincent price and ingrid bergman all but to name a few was a delight in itself also the finale while silly is great fun all in all dead men don't wear plaid is well worth the look 8/10 bethany cox
