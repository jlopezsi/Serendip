i love killer car movies as people who've read my other reviews will no doubt know by now so as soon as i read about this film i just had to see it living in the uk though it was near impossible to find especially since the wheels of terror amazon.co.uk has is actually the 1987 film the misfit brigade which they mistakenly claim is this film as mb had the alternate title wheels of terror but finally after going to a second-hand video shop and asking them to use their internet search engine they found a copy of this film the genuine article for me br br i must say at the outset that it was well worth the wait to finally see this excellent film yes i can see how the plot could be considered a duel rip-off but it manages to be original by throwing in a plot about a real horror we must face in real life that of a perverted and mysterious child killer said killer is never actually seen in the movie not even a glimpse unlike the duel truck driver whose feet and hands on the steering wheel are seen at certain junctures but is represented by his omnipresent 74 dodge charger one of the most menacing vehicles ever seen in a movie i said to a friend recently that i always think black chargers make excellent villain cars which is why i'm glad tarantino is using one in his death proof segment of grindhouse br br joanna cassidy is brilliant in her role as divorced bus driver laura trying to raise her daughter in arizona and eventually having to save her from the unseen child molester after she is kidnapped i admit i haven't seen many films ms cassidy has made but in the few i have seen who framed roger rabbit blade runner and ghosts of mars she has been absolutely wonderful her desperation and determination to save her daughter and ensure the pervert never harms anybody again are very believable the rest of the cast are okay though apart from marcie leeds as stephanie laura's daughter very few of them are on screen long enough to make much of an impact i agree with some reviewers about the whiny kids on the bus during the big chase sequence being annoying but at least laura lets them out to call the police and in case you're wondering how the school bus can keep up with the murderous muscle car there's a gratuitous info-dump scene near the start where latino mechanic luis points out that he put a racing engine into the bus why he would do that i don't know but it explains how the bus is able to chase the charger br br as you can see i do believe the film has faults other main ones being the over-use of slow motion shots in what's supposed to be a climactic car chase and stephanie somehow not noticing that a creepy-looking car is following her down the street at one point but apart from those minor gripes i would rate wot as one of my all-time favourite car chase films and i hope that it gets the dvd release it so richly deserves strongly recommended
