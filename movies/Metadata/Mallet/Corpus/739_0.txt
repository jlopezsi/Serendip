judging by the plot and the fact that it's directed by silvio amandio i feared that this giallo would be a lot like the director's earlier success amuck but despite similarities between the pair smile before death is a lot more than merely a retread of the earlier work this film adheres more closely to the giallo tradition of stylish and bloody murders than the earlier movie but still finds time to ensure that the plot always revolves around the central situation in fact it's a miracle that amandio has managed to keep his script from becoming a complete mess as aside from this new flair for murders and the central situation smile before death is also a twisty little thriller which manages to pull several things out of the hat before boiling down to a superb and unexpected conclusion the plot follows the death of a woman named dorothy the police declare it suicide but it's not long before dorothy's daughter nancy makes her way to her mother's house where she meets the seductive gena and her stepfather marco however things turn sinister when the housekeeper divulges some information that means dorothy's death may not have been suicide br br the film starts off slowly and aside from some lush photography that makes good use of its female leads the film doesn't really commence until the half way point amandio keeps the tension bubbling throughout and sex is always at the forefront of the action roberto pregadio provides a suitable catchy jingle which accompanies nearly every scene in the movie the tune is typically italian and fits the movie well but i'd have preferred it if it was played a bit less often as it soon starts to get old and the overall impact is lessened the movie benefits as amuck did from a great leading performance from rosalba neri who is joined by the stunning luciana della robbia the pair doesn't share any scenes together that are as great as those between neri and barbara bouchet in amuck but silvio amandio obviously enjoys filming lesbian scenes and when they're this good i enjoy watching them the film is rounded off by an isolated atmosphere which provides a pressure cooker for the lead characters to roast in this is a rare giallo in that by the conclusion most aspects of it make sense and while smile before death is hard to track down i recommend making the effort
