this film has obviously gained a lot of attention since quentin tarantino's kill bill volume one and volume 2 came out i am not ashamed to admit i got interested in it after it being linked to kill bill but then again i hadn't heard of it until a while after the kill bill movies came out and i thought it sounded like something i'd be interested in my kind of movie and it definitely is br br let's get it out there in the open this film is really silly it has those great seventies kung fu noises when someone jumps up in the air unlike any human could as well as noises when someone shoves a sword into the enemy but because it's silly don't jump to the conclusion that there isn't a point to watching it sure it's just entertainment but the story is one of the best i've ever witnessed and not because of the blood and guts br br the story is of course about revenge but the revenge spawns from a woman who gives birth to a daughter and swears that the daughter must be an instrument of revenge on those that messed with her mother a silly premise but here's where it becomes cool meiko kaji who plays lady snowblood also known as yuki doesn't spend the movie wrapped in evil and revenge with anger on her face there's genuine hurt in her performance it is actually extremely sad that all she is is an instrument of revenge and death but that's what weighs the film down into some sort of believability br br the sets are standard japanese action sort of sets but they have that certain charm about them that's easy on the eyes it locks the film into this particular recognizable genre but still stands on its own two feet as a film also another standard in this genre is freeze frames usually i like to comment on shots that continue movement but a certain frame frozen or still moving is my favourite of a film now one freeze frame if memory serves me correctly the only one of the baddie coming up some stairs that may be the second shurayukihime apologies if it is and one side of her face is visible in the freeze frame to alert the audience of this woman's arrival it is laughable in this but laughable for the right reasons it isn't corny or annoying but it's a genuine charm of this genre br br many standards of this genre may stop you from watching this but watch it for the genuine heart-wrenching story of yuki kashima also known as shurayukihime lady snowblood br br a genuine piece of cinematic gold that is also entertaining and worth a watch
