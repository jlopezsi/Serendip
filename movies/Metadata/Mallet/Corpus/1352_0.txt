or should it be thelma and lewis br br basically this movie is mindless fun something that may have you chuckling once or twice and rolling your eyes a few times as well nobody is on their best behavior in this light and slightly campy film you've all read the plot summary rich brat kidnaps herself but gets more than she bargained for when her car is stolen from the garage and romance ensues br br the cast is very good in all their places silverstone plays a spoiled rich brat that wants desperately desperately for her father's love and attention but daddy is too busy with his business life and dealings some of which are not on the most up and up while he's no mafia don it's hinted that he's not the cleanest business man in the world walken is daddy's enforcer who seems to help in some of the shadier deals that daddy makes but walken has a decent relationship with silverstone and seems to be more fatherly in his relations with her br br del toro plays a high end car thief who steals beautiful machines on order you want a ferarri ok we'll get you a ferarri del toro is a bit annoying with his slow dialect and dumb founded look harry connick jr plays del toro's agent in the car rip off ring he does a great job in this role that i think is one of his first br br overall the movie is fun sure it's not the greatest comedy romantic or otherwise on the face of the planet but it's decent fare a decent way to burn a few hours if you're a sliverstone fan you'll probably like this one if you're a del toro fan well he's just himself with a bad speech pattern walken is his typical bad guy self and shines br br overall i'd give it a b
