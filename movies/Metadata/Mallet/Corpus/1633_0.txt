it's too bad andre de toth didn't contribute more to the noir cycle because on the evidence he was a natural plus he was married to early-noir icon veronica lake the pitfall made in 1948 looks more and more like one of the best and most central movies in the cycle but except for the early more gothic dark waters de toth only returned to it once with crime wave its story is not a fresh one an ex-con trying to go straight gene nelson is coerced by circumstances to aid and abet a gang of his former cellmates the uncomfortable spot he finds himself in lies between them and the law personified by sterling hayden as a tough unforgiving police detective there's much more attention to character in the film's hour-and-a-quarter running time than in many full-length features of the era jay novello as an alcoholic veterinarian who doubles as an underworld sawbones is especially memorable by any reckoning crime wave is a minor film even a minor second feature but de toth lavishes easy expertise on it it's surprisingly well paced well shot as well interestingly cut why so many talented directors many of them refugees from europe were relegated in the 1950s to genre movies crime dramas 3-d schlockfests and westerns is a puzzle in any case i'd give any three of de toth's westerns and his house of wax for just one more film noir boasting his directorial credit
