this movie put director luc besson into the big league br br the basic story is about a drugged up vicious street punk serving a life sentence for killing a cop.she is given a second chance at freedom of sorts by a top secret french assassination agency.the movie shows her transformation into something better then she was and the affect it has on the two men in her life that mean something to her br br this movie is amazingly well acted anne parillaud marc duret patrick fontana are outstanding br br this is a pretty violent movie but not just for the sake of violence,it is a necessary counter-point to nikkita's blossoming appreciation of life.the violence is realistic and well done br br the action scene's are fast pasted and tense br br everything about this film is top notch i recommend it
