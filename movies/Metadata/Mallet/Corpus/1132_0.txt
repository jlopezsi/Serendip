arguably a tad better than the similar pure luck the man features sam jackson as an federal agent who somehow ends up playing nursemaid to salesman eugene levy as they pursue the bad guys who have killed jackson's partner this one is a real groaner with levy playing the bespectacled fish out of water to jackson's perpetually scowling lawman a lot of time is spent in jackson's car a lot of time i have to admit i could not sit through this one to the end but then who could levy is mildly funny but a little of him goes a long way as he has proved in everyone of his movies jackson is picking up a paycheck pure and simple skip the man
