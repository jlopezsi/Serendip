varalaru is a very good movie and lot of hard work in that film p.c.sriram work is excellent and a.r.rehman did a wonderful job.all songs are feast the director k.s.ravikumar has add his stamp from the first scene itself a fast-paced narration with some interesting incidents weaved in which doesn't allow you much time to ponder on the flaws and which camouflages the inadequacies of the script makes varalaru engaging viewing and the soul of the film is undoubtedly ajit who performs his three diverse characters with panache the actor has put in much effort demarcating each role with such finesse and understanding that it is a sheer delight watching him on screen there is shiva the ageing business tycoon bound to his wheelchair sharing a strong bonding with his son vishnu indulgent while vishnu whiles away his time with his cronies taking life easy but then suddenly vishnu starts behaving out of character his drunken bouts and acts causing the father much shame and embarrassment and when vishnu professes to remember nothing of what he had done the father takes him to a psychiatrist.with varalaru ajit has bounced back with a vengeance and re-established his credentials as an actor who can deliver if given the right role and projected suitably the famished look of tirupati is gone and we get to see a handsome eminently watchable ajit here.then appears jeeva vishnu's look-alike and the cause of vishnu's woes jeeva's target is shiva and his motive vengeance for the wrong done to his mother decades back the flashback episodes has ajit playing a classical dancer and it is here that the actor scores with his perfect body language to go with the character of the dancer and the feminine mannerisms he adopts to go with it ajit cuts a fascinating picture his classical dance number is performed with such finesse that it takes you by sheer surprise br br while asin peps up the scenes in the earlier part with her vivaciousness kaniha gets the performing role as the older ajit's pair br br the songs are nice to hear going to hit the chart list soon one of the great work of a.r.rehman director k s ravikumar who had struck the right chord with the actor in a dual role in villain earlier has done it yet again here too br br everyone did their job perfectly i recommend everyone to watch this movie i am sure you will love it
