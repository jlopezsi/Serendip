mèxico being an almost 100 catholic country produced several nunsploitation flicks in the 70's before censorship took a big role in mexican movies there were many many exploitation flicks for different tastes i must admit that this isn't a masterpiece by any means but it is a movie that deserves a chance and will please fans of gore and sleaze br br many mexicans tend to easily scare with plots like the one in satànico pandemonium because it deals with two restricted topics in mexican society sex and religion nastiness br br satànico pandemonium does not rank high on the exploitation heaven but it manages to deliver quality intense violence and disturbing images for those who enjoy this kind of cinema the language used in this movie is macabre and it's very relevant for the plot if you speak spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation br br the raw acting is a key factor in the movie for example the afro american nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random you just watch her cry and suffer the scene takes relevance as the plot develops she's aided by sister maria who convinces her to commit suicide br br many situations like that one make you think where's the coherence with these mexican film makers but that's just to add tension also the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction the atmosphere in the convent is sinister and the fact that the devil is prowling outside makes it even more a scary place i praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning the events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister br br the music is also convincing and very disturbing the director knows how to create a disturbing scary setting with the correct use of light sounds and suspense the acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur except for pezet who delivers a brave solid performance she's a beautiful woman with nerves she was perfect for the role because she's extremely pretty has an angel face the perfect prey for satan she deserved more leading roles in her career too bad that this was her last movie she was just too beautiful to be involved in nunsploitation flicks veteran t.v and movie actor enrique rocha gives a strong performance as the devil and his voice is scary alone he was great the rest of the cast is just plain and dull br br the movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts after the opening credits satan seduces sister mary and then the horror starts immediately she is tempted in several scenes and finally when she falls into satan's tramp she starts a rampage of sex and murder thank you br br maybe europeans aren't easily scared with topics like the devil seducing or torturing nuns,but here in mèxico it's a different deal the devil is by far the scariest character in mèxican culture now if you mix him with religion which is something very delicate here you have a terrifying experience in the first minutes there is auto flagellation good gore lesbian nun sex and satan mèxico created this interesting premise which sadly in the 80's and 90's was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema i'm glad that these movies get dvd releases for europe so they can recognize the country's talent in horror br br the main problem with this movie is the lack of continuity and coherence in the plot first we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns so the movie is set in the mid 1600's then what should we realize about the ending it's too easy to blame the devil but it does no makes sense br br anyways satanico pandemonium has become somewhat a cult nunsploitation movie it was even referenced in from dusk till dawn the weak point of the movie is that it hasn't aged very well the veteran director is heavily influenced by classic theater techniques and acting and does not gives a dynamic mood to the movie the camera angles are boring at some points and some events truly last longer than they should for example when sister maria takes care of the sick cow or when she realizes she's been tempted by the devil br br at some point it looks like a very old horror movie but with lots of gore talking about gore the movie has two highlight gory scenes in my opinion first when sister maria seduces and later stabs marcelo to death the scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun like that would seduce you and later it grosses you out i felt sorry for marcelo's tender grandmother the other scene is when sister maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns the gore is great in this movie expect stabs self punishment and a glorious flashback sequence involving the inquisition excellent for those who like gore br br mèxico is not all about raw cheesy gory flicks involving wrestlers with no plot mèxico had a huge potential in the genre but as many people know politicians and constitutional presidents banned the rise of mexican exploitation sure it came back in the 80's but not as a horror sub-genre it came among low budget action movies and the typical valentìn trujillo flicks br br give a try to satànico pandemonium because it offers blood gore a scary plot for us who respect the religious factor and a dark atmosphere buy it for all of it's goodies i believe there's an unrated version
