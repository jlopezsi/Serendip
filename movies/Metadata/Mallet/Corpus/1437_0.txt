i have a great deal of affection for this movie it's flawed but it's a hoot granger certainly makes a unique and entertaining holmes the decision to cast bernard fox as watson was a fabulous move the cast also includes the always entertaining anthony zerbe and william shatner too i agree with another reviewer who noted that holmes living on a hill overlooking london is definitely a nice touch it truly conjures up the idea of holmes as a protector of the city this version of the classic tale deserves it's reputation as a cheap and cheesy tv movie but it also deserves to be remembered as being hell of a lot of fun i've had a ball enjoying this one on many occasions fun stuff
