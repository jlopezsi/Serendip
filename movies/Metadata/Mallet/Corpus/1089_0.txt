this was a fun movie it's more comedy than action the action scenes are good and will have you wishing you knew martial arts like a lot of jackie chan movies it's your usual story of two twins separated at birth and raised in completely different identities one grows up on the tough streets and the other is trained in classical music they run into each other in hong kong and of course are mistaken for each other by the bad guys and two attractive women br br the sidekick gets to be really annoying especially during the final action sequence but try to ignore him and enjoy the movie br br if you aren't one of those people who have developed a preconceived idea of what makes a jackie chan film good or bad you will probably enjoy this film br br it is dubbed on the dvd release i wish it had a choice of dubbing or subtitles
