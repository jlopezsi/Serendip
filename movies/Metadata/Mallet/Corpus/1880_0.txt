i don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie that's probably because they're not into real horror films or b-movies in general i'm sure they'd hate pink flamingos too the plot is not confusing not less then pulp fiction's structure might be i personally find this film brilliant and the continuous changes of places/events just made it more interesting to watch every gross element is there to help the other side of the movie come out a comedy that's a creepy comedy and all its oddities perfectly counterbalance fear and fun the soundtrack is great and there are two songs of the dictators in it those alone give it a good rock n roll injection that raise horror house on highway five on a higher rank than many boring standard slahers i've seen i won't spoil anything of the story cause i've had a lot of fun discovering myself piece by piece how the different characters were going to meet in the end br br highly recommended if you like stuff like criminally insane spookies mosquito der sch√§nder death bed the bed that eats
