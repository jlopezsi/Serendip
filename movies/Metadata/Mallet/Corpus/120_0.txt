this isn't my typical movie genre i am more interested in character drama than action movies this is able to span both genres in a way that hollywood hasn't managed to accomplish the plot was interesting and the acting by anne parillaud was exceptional br br i had seen the american remake called point of no return and found it to be an ok movie but i wanted to see the original i am glad that i did the technical aspects of direction and editing are very good the plot was interesting revolving around the timeless theme of redemption the acting made this an exceptional movie br br for fans of the action genre they will be quite happy for those like myself who are more interested in character and plot-driven movies may find this to be a pleasant surprise as well
