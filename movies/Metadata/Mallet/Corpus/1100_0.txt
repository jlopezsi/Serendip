it's no city hunter but this is a pretty goofy flick it's just good fun though and even if you think twin movies are bad this is jackie chan i like it it's just a cute fun flick let's not forget to mention the ending though it's worth the price of admission alone with some of the coolest and most dangerous stunts i've ever seen can't take my eyes off nina li or maggie cheung either
