this series was pathetic it had bad acting overworked special effects and wimpy bad guys as a fan of the original film i found the series as a boring watered down version of an excellent story in the film not only did brandon lee kill people he looked as if he could whereas this wannabe mark dacascus looks as if he couldn't punch his way out of a paper bag.anyway if you want action go and see the brandon lee version as stairway to heaven is more of a soap opera as i said the series is simply watered down and it just contains scenes from the original movie but has cut out some of the interesting characters and the more energetic fights and trash talking but if you'd rather not think too much then hey why not watch stairway to heaven really though its just too soppy for me in the crow both movie and comic eric draven was a tortured vicious individual who wanted to tear apart the people who had ruined his life/death but mark dacascus character is content to simply scare them into being better people that really doesn't cut it for me if someone had brutally murdered you and your fianc wouldn't you be walking around in the red haze i think you would and i know i would too i think that maybe this series was targeted at a younger audience which would warrant the toned down violence less objectionable drugs and less gruesome weaponry but really they were the things that made the movies as dark and confronting as they were oh well i suppose you can't win em all
