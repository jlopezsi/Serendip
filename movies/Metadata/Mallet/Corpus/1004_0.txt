the movie isn't worth much of my time it is total crap i rented this movie because it has tom savini listed at the top of the credits and had kung-fu zombies savini was in the movie for about 5 minutes the kung-fu zombie scene was short and poorly done i should have looked farther down and saw that lloyd kaufman was is this movie the i would have realized that this is a piece of crap troma movie br br it is a piece of crap isn't very funny my two laughs 1 uwe boll came on before the movie started and said this movie sucks and don't watch it i started thinking i wouldn't trust uwe's opinion on a zombie film 2 the police were a little funny when they were framing someone br br the rest of the movie was total crap there were a bunch of cameos from b movie stars and a bunch of bad attempts to intentionally make scenes look unintentionally bad i was wired up when the movie started from winning a close softball game 15-14 but this movie put me to near sleep within 10 minutes do watch it it is bad
