while i prefer groucho's humor the most amongst all three marx brothers it's just not the same without chico and harpo for groucho to play off of br br i had never seen carmen miranda in action though i had long known of her being a performer with kooky hats now that i've seen her on screen i think she comes across as a cross between marlene dietrich and charo a surprisingly fun mix she's actually a good foil for groucho so i think it's the screenplay that doesn't play to their full potentials it's still a fairly charming movie with carmen taking on the role of two different stage performers and groucho providing zingers
