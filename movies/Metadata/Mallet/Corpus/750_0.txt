this movie is stupid in a bad way it's from the same director john boorman that gave us the screen gems zardoz and the exorcist ii which should have told me not to see this movie instead of wasting two hours of my life i think it would have been enough for him to just show a sign saying white people industrialization satan the director isn't even content with having that message subtly portrayed but rather goes in for the slapping us with it br br spoiler and you have to love the plausable ending where the native people when in the end by using drugs to call their spirit people to make the dam blow up it's like the writers thought to themselves hmm wow i blew all our money on cocaine and i still don't have an ending i bet a happy ending would sell well it even ended with the words on the screen saying a few tribe still have not made contact with the outside world they remember something we forgot how stupid and cheesy is that and i won't even get started on how the fierce people steal the invisible people's women and sell them into prostitution for alcohol end spoiler br br this movie p ed me off the acting was actually decent but just completely ruined by the story line it was melodramatic tripe and it could have been so interesting the only other plus is the beautiful scenery
