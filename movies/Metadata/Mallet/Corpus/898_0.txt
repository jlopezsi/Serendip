mindnumbing bad slasher flick about a killer who's killing off a young film crew while playing a godawful new wave track that goes something like boil me boil me boil me cut me cut me on his tape deck it's painfully apparent that nobody in front or behind the camera have no clue what so ever what the hell they're doing incomprehensable story dialogue that makes no sense acting from hell weird cuts etc about halfway through i got the creeping suspicion that this slasher abomination was the brainchild of a bunch of really confused hippie freaks there was just one misplaced quasi-philosophical mumbo-jumbo line longhaired acoustic guitar player or i'm not going to mess with a bunch of food picky drug freaks line too many to pass unnoticed especially in a god-damned teen slasher flick label under uniquely bad since it's from 1981 it was pretty enjoyable as a cheezy turkey if it was from 2001 i would probably hate it you won't believe the twist ending guaranteed to make any intelligent sensible human being lose their lunch
