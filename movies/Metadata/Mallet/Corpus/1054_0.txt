if i hadn't seen his otar iosseliani's next film 1999's masterpiece adieu plancher des vaches so my comment will probably be linked to the two films rather than only to this particularly strange journey adrift in a parisian's tramp mind war is the main thread that links his dreams as he embodies a medieval king or a communist leader or remembers of his east-european country ravaged by war but more interesting is the permanent obsession for iosseliani of typical features like cinema in itself paris where the director actually lives he's from georgia tramps alcohol and songs the scenes which i think are real in opposition to dreamt ones mainly show the hero with his unfortunate friends but still happy singing beautiful harmonies just like the last scene and others from adieu it is a bit difficult to follow the plot since there are so many different ages edited together but as the very first sequence shows us this is only cinema so just let your mind wander with the pictures
