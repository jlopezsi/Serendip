my favorite jackie chan film a showcase for his physical skill and personal charisma it has the right amount of fighting without becoming boring and monotonous it has the right amount of comedy without being over the top the sex farce is played like feydeau and yet is handled deftly enough to allow one to take one's older children without squirming on anyone's part great
