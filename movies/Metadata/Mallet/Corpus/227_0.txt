wow i don't know whether to love sadako or fear her ring 0 completes the trilogy and makes it into an epic we delve into the complicated and frightening yet very tragic character that is sadako yamamura like ring 2 this film continues the enrichment of the ring mythos we watch the frightening tragic story of sadako unfold before our eyes we discover a more human sadako one that feels love and compassion in spite of her peculiarities and we are once again frightened as we were in the previous movies in a way the terror is more effective here than in ring 2 even in light of a movie that feels more like a tear-jerking drama at times than like a horror film this is a must-see for fans of the first two movies watch it you won't be sorry even if some of the introduced story elements seem a little strange they are carried out beautifully sadako herself is beautiful and enchanting br br i'll conclude with one final statement if you thought a staggering ghostly sadako was intimidating wait until you see her when she's alive and kicking and more powerful than she ever was as an ethereal presence now she has the ability to kill at will rather than with a cursed videotape br br hmm do i sound like i'm contradicting myself about sadako i'm not going to explain myself just watch the movie and see for yourselves
