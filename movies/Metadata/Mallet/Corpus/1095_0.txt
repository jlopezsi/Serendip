this is a great movie i used to watch it as a kid when i went to my grandparents house i'm not that old heh just a fast paced movie with action all the way through if you've seen any jackie chan movie you'll know that he likes to be funny even when he's performing the stylized fight scenes the great thing about chan is that a all his own stunts and b no wire fighting yep this is the real stuff br br this movie was filmed when practical cg was still a little sketchy in the scenes with both boomer and ma you can tell that there's only real jackie if you look hard enough you can see the little fuzzies around the cg chan br br but yeah this is like all of chan's more recent films a few good guys against an evil coorporation/gang nothing new here jackie chan's just a fun guy
