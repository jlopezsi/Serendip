i saw this movie a couple of days ago i thought this one is one of the best in the recent anime films including miyazaki's even satisfied more than 007 br br based on the comic by matsumoto taiyo also ping pong michael arius who joined animatrix production directed the film as he knows many japanese old downtowns and landscapes his way of constructing the imaginary town is so real though many asian tastes are added and i believe the town in the film must attract americans too the story is basically fights between two boys and intruders old traditions and new i also impressed how this anime can express things which i have not felt in the other anime films michael gathered many best creators in japan and the world i really recommend tekkon to you all br br by the way moma's artforum picked up this film as 1 in 2006 http www.artforum.com/inprint/id=12076
