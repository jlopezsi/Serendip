i love this movie although not amongst bergman's best it is very funny in parts and should not be shunned maybe slightly overlong each time i watch it i wait impatiently for the lift-scene near the end of the film but very much worthwhile indeed the scene in the lift with gunnar bjornstrand great actor and eva dahlberg is fascinating funny and frivolous for the year it was made
