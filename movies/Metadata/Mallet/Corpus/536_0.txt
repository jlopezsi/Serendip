warning spoilers ahead br br short version this movie sucks long version as somebody else wrote the hole is in the plot line or better there are lots of holes but mainly br br a martin has a perfect alibi yet he's the suspect from the beginning and nobody believes him but since they find him dead with the key he must be guilty and liz must surely be rather strong if she can plunge him in the river so easily and rather quick to put the key in his pocket without anybody in the audience noticing martin dies only a few yards away from liz's house but no one seems to care about that br br b hello did anybody tell the psychologist there were three dead bodies in the cell one of which with his head crushed how come the police acts as if nothing happened and no one ever talks about it how come liz was never questioned seriously about these deaths the first version of the story ends with everybody coming out of the hole happy and smiling but the psychologist seems to believe it br br c the hole is abandoned since ww ii but there still is electricity the hole has an emergency exit which can be locked from outside in order to make it completely unuseful the door of the hole has a glass part but nobody tries to break it br br d)the door key magically appeared in martin's pockets some time before because he won't let us know who gave it to him and if we knew it that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole and that would have made it too complex for the writers br br e nobody in the school noticed that the boys didn't go to wales and their families didn't notice they didn't come home it took at least three days to understand that there was something wrong br br f liz is so convincing when she talks that everybody instantly believes her see the ending br br g think about this when liz came out the door was open if martin was on holiday who the hell could open it without a key br br i think that's enough to explain why the movie doesn't work br br a thriller is a dangerous game if you want to play it with the audience you must be sure you can handle it as many famous screenwriters said you've got to take the story and shake its foundations if it survives you've probably got a good movie coming on this one crumbles quite miserably
