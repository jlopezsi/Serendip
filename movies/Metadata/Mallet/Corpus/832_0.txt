wow this movie is great if what you want is to be an active spectator and interactive with the movie you'll not be disappointed you'll try to think about what you see and try to solve this whole strange piece of art br br its about the choices that we make small choices as to deceide yes or no to cut the moustache and what are the consequences on our life and the impact toward us by the people we know am i important to their eyes even if they are called friends will they notify any difference on our life it's also about the search of our identity and how our identity becomes the one of the other in a relashionship with a lover br br you choose what ever is the meaning of this movie but i believe the director has it's own precise explanation about every detail i have my own i think most of the movie is imagination of the character and the only reality scenes are the ones where he walks everyday in the metro of hong-kong depressed after his wife would have left him during the vacations in hong-kong where he shave his moustache even those vacations are a little bit transformed mentally by the reconstitution it's a flash-back and all the scenes in paris are imagination of a life he would have had with his wife if they would have stayed together with constantly rethinking of his choice of shaving the moustache it's like hanneke's cach or more like lynch's mulholland drive we travel into the infinite spiral of the human spirit everything is interior and subjective the music of philip glass is sublime and will obsess you br br you won't forget this movie even if you don't like it
