i just caught this little gem on amc i missed the opening credits so i had no idea who directed it as the film progressed i was like this has got to be a john ford film after all it features john wayne harry carey ward bond and lots of wonderful ford like shots a wonderfully photographed and directed film it even has marjorie main in a character role that's a total departure from her normal boisterous parts we all know and expect from this great actress then i looked it up here at the imdb and saw that it was henry hathaway's film i never thought of hathaway as a bad director by any means but wow this simply has the look of a well crafted classic beginning to end highly recommended
