i have to admit at the end of the movie i was at first disappointed you are left with so many unanswered questions why didn't sean remember who the old lady was and why didn't he remember his lover when he met her if the love letters were written by nicole kidman's character how do we even know that the contents of those pages gave him the insight he had into her personal life anne hesh's character wasn't present when the recordings of the kid and what he said were played so how could she have known for herself the validity of the kid's testimony why would a ten year old boy put himself in such an awkward position where he was obviously aware of the damage it could cause the people involved i feel this was the director's intention for the movie kidman was right on the money when her character explained to her fianc that it wasn't her fault when referring to how everything happened it ended the way it should have because who runs away with a ten year old boy and tells him you'll wait until he's 21 to get married this showed reality of life and how we can't live in the fantasy in my opinion nicole kidman did a wonderful job in portraying a woman who had lost her true love the movie for me shows the anguish and torture love can cause and how it never disappears even when you belong to someone else the final touch was the song played during the credits the tone of the music set an uneasy mood that was chilling yet sweet and this was the feeling i was left with bittersweet i loved it
