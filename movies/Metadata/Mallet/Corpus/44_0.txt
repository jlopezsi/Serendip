i found it hard to view the user comments on this film because of all the partisan ranting from demagogues of both parties therefore i am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although i definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in iraq and the need for us involvement there br br this may contain spoilers although this is a simple documentary with no plot so there ain't much to spoil br br after all the hype about michael moore's slanted biased and intellectually dishonest film fahrenheit 911 and all the celebrity hubbub about how george bush is an evil so-and-so and our involvement in iraq was simply about obtaining oil i thought i might have a look at what the other side who gets far less sensationalistic coverage in the national media had to say about the whole situation i had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch but i thought it was important to see just what was going on in iraq before the us dismantled saddam hussein's regime br br it was brutal it was grotesque and it was very difficult to sit through we are treated to footage of people's arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles we see fingers hacked off then the screaming bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped outÂ—all these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of justice we see torture murder and disturbing footage of women being publicly shot or stoned to death for crimes such as adultery br br my problem is that the documentary hosted by some boring no-name yobbo in a suit and tie frequently wanders from its supposed focus in favor of showing gruesome footage at first it feels albeit unpleasant at least informative however as the film wears on it becomes even more unpleasant loses its informative nature and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone i found that shift in tone more disturbing than the film itself the film ends with every videotaped beheading they could find i had seen many when they were current news believing it important to see what the enemy terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists was all about but i just couldn't stomach re-watching these cold-blooded grotesque murders again presented as they were in the guise of infotainment and turned the movie off br br in some ways this film shows some important things that were happening within hussein's iraq that folks like sean penn either didn't see or chose to ignore it will make you appreciate living in a free country where you don't have your tongue cut out or your hands amputated for displeasing a mad dictator the us got involved in bosnia and somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to iraq saddam hussein actively and arrogant defied every un sanction and action taken against him including those he agreed to in order to end the war in 1991 but the un clearly wasn't going to do anything about it especially with corrupt un officials making under-the-table deals with hussein who else but the us would have taken steps to correct this injustice these are all good points made in the beginning of the film br br but the film's weakness is where it loses its focus on the reasons we went there and simply becomes a parade of gore brutality and murder although it has its good points i can't in good conscience recommend it as a good well-made documentary br br cheers br br brent
