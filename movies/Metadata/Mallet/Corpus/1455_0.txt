i really loved this movie it was such an enjoyable film due to the great chemistry between the two leads i can't seem to understand why sherilyn fenn isn't a huge star she brings so much emotional honesty and depth to her roles anyone looking for a fun movie with good acting and romance this is it great supporting cast too
