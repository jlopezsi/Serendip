eddie murphy stars in beverly hills cop ii.i think the first one was a tad bit better than this but not by much.i think this is a great sequel.eddie murphy is funny as usual and so is judge reinhold.it also stars brigitte nielson and there is even a small cameo from chris rock.the film has axel foley returning to solve another murder with the help of his two friends from the first film.i think beverly hills cop ii is a good sequel to a good action/comedy film and i recommend it if you enjoyed the first one br br rated r<br br 8/10
