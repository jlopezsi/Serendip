this movie is a great fun time there's nothing serious about it and there are no great characters or plot twists what you get instead is an enjoyable sit back and relax kind of movie the wizard of speed and time is a monument to the lost art of stop-motion animation the potential of this medium is fully exploited here with some truly amazing special effects it's also a very funny movie
