even if your not a western fan this show might still be for you a tale of the south dakota gold rush but thats only a mere background for the story you will watch characters your grandfather always told you about like wild bill hickok and calamity jane as well as seth bullock ian mcshane who stars as al swearengen after watching 3-4 episodes ian mcshane immediately rocketed to my top 5 actors merely for his role on this show yes this show does have a few goofs as you call them in vocabulary but who cares why be nit picky if continuous drinking gambling cursing or prostitution may offend you then this show is definitely not for you give deadwood a shot and you will be hooked the worst part is waiting until next week for another episode hbo has yet again created another great show
