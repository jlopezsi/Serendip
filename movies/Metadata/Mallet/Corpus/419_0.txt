first-off the only reason i'm writing this is because the 4.3 rating is almost impossible i mean the direction and cinematography by itself will get this movie to a 6 no i haven't read the book and i genuinely do not believe that the movie should be rated as per the adaptation from the book the performances standing out are melissa of course and her grandmother the music and cinematography have a presence of their own throughout the movie and the plot never gets boring or unrealistic given a slightly open imagination if you're aged anywhere between 15 and 35 i would highly recommend a viewing the only reason i gave it an 8/10 is because we have movies like fight club and animatrix
