this film is the reason ms davis didn't play scarlett as it would have been a rerun she has it down pat in her performance in this movie while she had so many great performances in her career very few top this one br br henry fonda is young in this film but very effective playing opposite as the male lead the film accidentally has a valuable historic lesson today's environmentalist chooses to ignore a fair piece of the plot centers around the fact that a plague fever type of illness is running through the south killing a lot of people br br fondas character is shown being bitten by a mosquito at one point in the movie he then becomes ill with the plague dies after he is bitten fonda's character says maybe with all these people getting sick dying the yankees up north have a good idea about draining all their swamps br br today environmentalists are trying to save wetlands but in order to do that they are ignoring the health risks to people living near them today west nile virus this proves there has to be a balance between preserving wetlands where there are not people living but making sure they don't exist too close to civilization either going to extremes by preserving wetlands in populated areas is dangerous br br this movie is very well made for 1938 ms davis has one of her strongest early performances in her career
