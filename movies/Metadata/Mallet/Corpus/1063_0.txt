i read and still re-read the book and must agree with other commentators the film is not the book or even reasonably based on the book hollywood can never get the idea that a book is famous because people read it because the author got it right the first time in published form they buy rights to film a book but then change the guts out of the book i loved only three things in this flick julie warner's comment bet your dad isn't happy he hired me can't even do my job sutherland's cool emotionlessness until sam almost dies it's like without sam he won't have anyone to abuse who won't tell him to go to heck the family feeling of the team everyone loves each other enough to be willing to die for their comrades too cool that said the story is told as one we've seen way too many times before and better before too i suggest to all our readers and commentators on here do what i do make your own movies and show them on public access cable channels in your area my crew and i have over the years made 12 films shown all over new york state and connecticut(though now i live in florida near disney world where the real aliens live and work lol
