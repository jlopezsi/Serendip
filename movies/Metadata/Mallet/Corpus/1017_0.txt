i came across this film under the title hot sweat at my local video store and rented it out of curiosity i had seen many movies by this director and always thought his work was severely underated the movie really surprised me with it's unsensationalistic style and well done cinematography although the female lead is very beautiful and manages to get undressed frequently there is always a tension to her sexuality she is forced to rely on it only because the audience is clearly made aware that on the other side is the penniless abyss rutger haur plays totally against type as a foppish young bank officer who adopts her as his mistress br br i think most people today think of holland as a totally liberal and affluent country this film goes a long way towards dispelling that stereotype and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a sometimes brutally realistic picture of 19th century life among the underclass in amsterdamn i liked it
