you know t's such a shame that neither of these films went wide release sure they needed a little touching up in some places but these films are definate quality material a breathe of fresh air in the horror films which is recreating itself once again as a truly important genre both of these films are good and borderline great they take somewhat sillacious storylines and make them somewhat believable filled with aggreassive dark humor and independent film dread this sequel is pretty much a direct continuation of the original it leaves the last films heroine bridget infected and fighting her illness with the cure found in the last film she's beginning to change when she's taken in by a youth facility and locked up for drug abuse what insues is unfortunatly unwelcome and senseless visits from the first films title charachter but a vast mixing pool of other cringe inducing twists including the fact that a male werewolf has found her and wants to mate a sleezy hospital guard who trades sexual favors for drugs an innocent little girl obsessed with comic books i wish i could truly give away the ending to you because it was so well done and i just didnt see it coming and that is what this film prides itself on unpredictability it goes in a completely opposite direction of where you though it was going and it makes sense all in all the film has much to be successful with believable performances especially from the film's lead bridget a good storyline suspenseful direction a creepy score all adding up to a startling refreshing take on an otherwise dying genre don't be fooled this sequel has major bite
