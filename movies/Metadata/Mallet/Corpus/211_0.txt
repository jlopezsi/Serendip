i liked ringu 0 better than rasen it explained more about sadako's history which you don't see too much of in any other ring movies it helped you build a person to person relationship with the character rather then seeing her as a mean abused child it portrays her as just an abused child you sort of take pity on her through this movie rather then thinking she's an evil spirit trying to raise hell the actress who played sadako was what seemed to me the only person that could play her i felt they could've mixed in more suspense and more thrills that would have made for a better j-horror movie it doesn't compare to the movies brought out by tartan asia exteme such as tale of two sisters phone memento mori whispering corridors wishing stairs a trilogy premonition h oldboy and many others if you enjoyed watching rasen ringu 0 ringu and ringu 2 you'll love the tartan asia extreme movies phone was my personal favorite look at the acting of the little girl and you will see why
