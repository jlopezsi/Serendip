a 4 only due to the brilliant vincent lindon as marc the equally brilliant emmanuelle devos as agnès performances in this pretty much 2 person movie f.tabouring's above review was excellent but he seems to miss the most obvious real point of the movie which is quite simply ridiculous the premise is excellent the movie begins continues halfway excellently unfortunately emmanuel carrère the novelist screenplay director has no idea what to do from midway to the end i did not read the novel but if this is a faithful adaption then i can only assume the book is as convoluted as the subsequent movie it is not anywhere near an accurate picture of an individual's fall into insanity it is not thought-provoking it is not hitchcockian in any way turns into a farce when the main character either physically or unconsciously supposedly travels to hong kong where he repeatedly rides the ferry between hong kong-to-kowloon as if searching for something the ending scenes are equally ridiculous as well as not thought out reminds me of a very young untalented unsophisticated director who thinks he is an artist br br i say unfortunately in my summary line above because this could have been a brilliant story of loss of identity subsequent fall into insanity told in such a way as to not have any neat conclusions but carried the viewer along for the ride this movie attempts to challenge the viewer but seems to have forgotten how to tell a story even the insane have moments of clarity which this movie clouds by being obtuse simplistic br br it's a shame to have wasted two brilliant actors their brilliant performances with such a terrible script by association an amateurish clumsy interpretation by the director/novelist proving that a novelist should not write the screenplay not direct the finished product
