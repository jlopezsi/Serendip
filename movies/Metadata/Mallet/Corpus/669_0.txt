the misleadingly titled romasanta the werewolf hunt is a disappointing pile of slow plodding period serial killer rubbish there are no real werewolves only that which goes on within the title character's head and because it's based on true events the movie is incredibly dry and uninventive in the story department add to this the fact that it's punctuated with moments of unnecessary tasteless violence and you have a fairly unsatisfying product br br i can't really understand why romasanta's gone down so well with people yes i admit it is at times atmospheric and the actors are very good in it but the honest truth is despite this it's dull boring and at times deeply unpleasant i really could have lived without seeing a deaf child caught in a bear trap then systematically have her eyes gouged out even in a good movie such a scene would force me to seriously question what the director was attempting to accomplish but in a movie so ineffectual as this it just seems pointless tasteless and sensational br br still as i have stated i could have stomached the violence given my history of watching a lot of violent movies were the movie in any way enthralling but romasanta is like cinematic wallpaper with the exception of romasanta's horrific acts which you never see him caught in the act of anyway romasanta really left me with the impression that nothing happened romasanta isn't at all sympathetic as a character given that he kills and robs indiscriminately with immense cruelty throughout the entire film so his pleas that he is insane toward the end of the movie obviously supposed to be an emotional high point pass without event or interest and without this the movie is robbed of any sense of climax br br to be honest i expected very little from romasanta but i did expect a werewolf which it didn't produce and i expected a plot with high and low points and obvious progression which it didn't produce either if you have to see this rent it don't buy it and i'd recommend you don't waste your time either way anyhow
