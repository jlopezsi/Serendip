this first episode of monk and the next part 2 originally released together with it as monk the premiere movie are essentially everything that television should be as close to perfection as i have ever seen on american tv br br from here the show could have gone up ever so slightly to be one of the greatest television series in the airwaves history heck i'll nominate it for that honor on season one's merits alone alas mr monk and the candidate is still the show's best episode directly after it comes the psychic a huge step down from there the series rose again for most of it's first season but never as high as at its inception br br season two was still amiably enjoyable but hardly great season three pained me to watch i am of course being harsh but in fairness i am being so out of the tremendous expectations this fine mystery-cop-comedy show gave me but i can still most heartily recommend season one to anyone i meet and most particularly recommend this fantastic episode it should be required viewing for anyone desiring the title well-rounded human being
