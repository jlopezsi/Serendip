i essentially agree with anonymous of raleigh nc below br br the holocaust is of course the most saturation retold story of modern media history this version is way weaker than many and adds nothing to the genre it doesn't succeed in making us care especially poignantly about the victims in fact it's much weaker than many other holocaust films in that br br the two strongest holocaust films at least of recent vintage are the inimitable schindler's list towering above all but also jacob the liar life is beautiful is also poignant br br this one is dreck br br i only saw it for kirsten dunst she too is disappointing here probably largely because the character she is asked to play a spoiled affluent brat is fundamentally unappealing and unidimensional until near the end
