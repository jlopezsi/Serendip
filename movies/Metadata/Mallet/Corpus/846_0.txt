warning to guys you will probably hate this movie but i think most women judging from the user comments will love it this is a quintessential chick flick it shouldn't be taken too seriously as it is a fantasy piece you will have to suspend your sense of reality to enjoy this but that's the point br br at the heart of this story is the idea that we all have one true love we are destined to be with call it fate destiny or even god-ordained but it's the notion that forces will conspire to put us in touch with our one and only soul-mate br br this movie reminds me of another one of my favorite contemporary movies serendipity(2001 in the sense of being destined to find our soul-mate although it is not a fantasy piece i think guys probably find the fantasy imaginary friend notion of ihtby a little too corny for their tastes but if you like a good cheesy romance story then you should like this picture br br i've notice several reviewers criticize rogers for her little girl squeaky voice but i think in this role it enhances the story if you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old when she first meets her soul-mate i know this is a stretch but that is how i interpreted it and it worked for me br br i love the sets and costumes in this movie it makes for a visual feast rogers gowns are unbelievably gorgeous especially the wedding gown at the very end but even her dressing gowns were quite elaborate adding to the notion of just how wealthy her family is i find it hard to believe women actually wore these they look incredibly uncomfortable if the beautiful mansion set with the incredible staircase looks familiar you may recognize it from holiday 1938 the george cukor film starring katherine hepburn and cary grant that staircase is just amazing the most beautiful i have ever seen br br there is one thing i did find hard to swallow and i didn't notice it until rogers and wilde are in the car and he finally decides to marry her how did he not notice the huge honking diamond engagement ring on her finger and not know she was already engaged also look closely at wilde's left ring finger in this scene as well he looks like he is wearing a ring on that finger that is being disguised so as to not be noticeable what is that about
