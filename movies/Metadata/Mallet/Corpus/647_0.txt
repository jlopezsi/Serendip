genuinely one of the best and most original pilot movies in recent years tony shalhoub is a fabulous actor but in the charactor of adrian monk he has truly outdone himself making adrian come to life before our eyes i can't say enough good things about this pilot movie or about the tv series which followed see it and fall in love with adrian's world i did enjoy
