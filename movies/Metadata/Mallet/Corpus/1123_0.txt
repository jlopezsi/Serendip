i just rented this movie last weekend and i can't understand why it only was nominated for a razzie that's crap this movie by far was one of the funniest movies i've seen and it was well worth watching eugene levy was great samuel l jackson was great even kathryn greenwood from whose line is it anyway played the great flight attendant this movie is full of hilarious lines which i'm sure you'll be quoting and some incredibly funny situations from slapstick to serious comedy this movie has it all all wrapped up into a great story that will keep you rolling and crying i'm surprised no one has seen or even heard of this movie but i say it's good oh well just watch it and you'll agree with me i guarantee it
