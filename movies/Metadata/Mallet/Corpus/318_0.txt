obviously most people didn't think this movie to be much anything special although i tend to disagree i thought this movie was probably one of the best sci-fi films in years that i've seen peter weller best known as robocop is also a very under-rated actor who deserves some good roles these days the only problem with this movie was the very poorly done special fx i'm sure if this movie would have been given a bigger budget it would have done better in theaters
