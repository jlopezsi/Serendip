the tv guide described this as fast and furious well i`d describe this film as diahorrea because it`s fast and furious faeces i wasn`t expecting it to be up to much but i was shocked as to what a poor film rangers is<br br possible spoilers but don`t worry you won`t want to see this movie<br br the film starts with an airborne shot of a hercules c-130 then it cuts to the interior of the plane which in no way resembles a c-130 it resembles a gym changing room where we`re introduced to the characters in some of the most painful exposition i`ve seen of having the leader discuss what the mission is and why they`re all wearing syrian army uniforms br br cut to some stock footage of men skydiving from a plane at dawn and then landing into the sea where they inflate a couple of rubber dingys underwater then cut to them resurfacing where it`s pitch black some team of special forces if it takes them all day to inflate a couple of dingys and wouldn`t the delta force or navy seals be doing this sort of stuff i`m just kind of curious why this film is called rangers br br so they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in syria or the lebanon neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone it gets worse though because one of the team says br br this jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe i had in las vegas br br yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex in fact would a prostitute in vegas be charging as little as twenty bucks shows you how bad a film like rangers is when you find yourself asking questions like that br br enough i could spend several pages writing about this piece of garbage but it`s not worth it it`s a cheap straight to video film composed of stock footage and a bunch of non actors giving the impression they`re making the story up as they go along i won`t finish on the old cliche that i wasted ninety minutes of my life on this crap because i only wasted thirty minutes of my life on it as i turned it off when the guy got blown out of the window
