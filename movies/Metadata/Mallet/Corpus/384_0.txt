after the explosively entertaining ginger snaps i had some doubts that the sequels could live up to the original but in this one we are greeted to a wonderful film picking up exactly where the first one left off now with bridget trying to stop herself from becoming a werewolf and escaping from the rehab center she has been placed in br br if you find cutting and self-mutilation to be disgusting then this is the film you want to either see or avoid the opening credits are over a scene of bridget in the bathtub cutting herself to pieces she continues to cut herself throughout the movie as well as give herself injections br br the scenery is fantastic as rehabs hospitals and insane asylums are always great places for horror films if you know how to film them the makers of this film know exactly what they're doing add secret passageways and you're set br br the new cast is also wonderful easily making up for ginger having a very small role the cast now has several male staffers working in an all-girl rehab center leading to such activities as trading sexual favors for drugs but most importantly is a new character named ghost presumably because she's almost like an albino who is fascinated with the occult and death and befriends bridget after finding out she might be a werewolf br br some interesting plot twists happen i can't reveal here and as the wolf blood begins to overtake the human blood things heat up and then another werewolf shows up to try and mate br br oh heck just watch the movie these guys have taken a worn-out horror staple lycanthropy and added such a new dimension to it that it's almost like an entirely new invention excelsior
