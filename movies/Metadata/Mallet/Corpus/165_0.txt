i found this accidentally on cable never heard of it before somehow this is one of orson welles finest portrayals better than citizen kane i believe kane's role after all was more bluster than acting no matter how fine the movie is it is hard to find anything to criticize the acting all around is superb the casting was perfect and the direction was impeccable natalie wood's very early portrayal of a native-speaking austrian girl is rather remarkable for her age too br br the very unusual plot lines are woven together quite well and right up to the end you cannot be sure just what is going to happen to resolve maybe everything this is such a tremendous piece that now i must go try to find the original book br br this is truly an undiscovered gem and i cannot understand why it is not better known it deserves to be
