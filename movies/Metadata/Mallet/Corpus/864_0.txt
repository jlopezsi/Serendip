this enactment of tom clancy's book is pretty accurate to content of book aside from a little over dramatization of the bill gates character and his evil empire/web browser br br it's still not as dramatic as reading the book i wish the pretty assassin had played a more prominent roll as well as but i don't want to ruin the story line for anyone br br read the book first and you will enjoy the movie more
