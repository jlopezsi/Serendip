until i watched this film many years ago i'd always associated foreign language films with more talky arty films this showed that there are top quality action films made outside hollywood too br br the film opens with a group of drug addicts breaking into a pharmacy to steal drugs things go wrong and most of them are shot and killed by the police nikita however survives but she is captured and jailed for the murder of a police officer she doesn't end up in jail though she is taken in by a government agency and given the choice of working for them or being killed she chooses to work for them and spends three years being trained in a variety of skills that will enable her to work as an assassin on her twenty third birthday bob her handler takes her out of the training facility for the first time she thinks it is just for a meal but ends up having to kill somebody and then fight her way out of the restaurant this is her final test before being allowed to leave the facility and make a life for herself she isn't totally free though whenever the agency calls she must drop whatever she is doing and perform a mission this is complicated by the fact that she now has a fianc who does not know what she does br br the action scenes are all very stylishly executed and the acting seemed good although not speaking french i had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said i'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes action films especially to people who liked luc besson's later film leon the main character of which is based on victor the cleaner in nikita
