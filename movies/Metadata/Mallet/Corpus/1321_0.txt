i was not expected an extraordinary movie such as beynelmilel recently there has undeniably been an increase in turkish movies however it is clear that quantity can not bring quality into the scenes i am grateful for seeing a master from gulmez and onder the budget was small contrary story and drama was at the highest we learn the life of gevendes local musicians in adiyaman region people were looking for a little bit freedom for their way of life for the moment it seems strange even listening music was prohibited by law makers we should appreciate the freedom we have now it is definitely that the freedom needs enlargement in turkey comparing in the days we live i feel better br br the movie was made so plain and perfect directors did not exaggerate the scenes to increase humour humour factor was talently implemented into the body of the movie as gulendam ozgu namal played very well she was really beautiful and capable of playing difficult characters as abuzer cezmi baskin was fantastic his play is not comparable to the other turkish players he is far behind them as semra meral okay capable of adding value to the movie we can see her power easily most of the other players are not famous but they were playing their roles like they are an expert br br in my opinion beynelmilel should have gone for oscar instead of dondurmam gaymak definitely the directors make beynelmilel in basic film rules and they seem to win success with the help of story players scenes culture
