rob reiner is hilarious i haven't seen the movie in a long time and have trouble finding it everywhere some of the humor is ethnic but to me seems pretty harmless as well as very funny i thought there was a lot of good slapstick and madcap silliness br br i'm not sure why the movie is not more available in stores or on different internet sites where some individual who had the interest in buying a movie like this would be able to have the opportunity to purchase a funny and entertaining and humorous movie such as this particular movie was br br if you can find it give it a try
