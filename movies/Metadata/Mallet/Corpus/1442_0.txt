this is one of those excellent short subject films that doesn't seem like either tv episode or someone attempting to get investors to expand it to feature length it's a very simple straightforward narrative brought to soul-stirring life by the gifted director ignore comments from those who seem too jaded to appreciate this little gem of a film and at less than 30 minutes what do you have to loose just to check it out br br in fact the reason i am writing this at all is because i wondered what he had done since i saw this years ago and found to my shock and dismay no one has given him a project br br it is included on the dvd for the now defunct film-fest dvd series issue 3 along with some other good shorts
