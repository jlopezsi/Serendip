for anybody who grew up between 1960 to the early 1980's the name charles nelson reilly should click with you especially if you watched a ton of kid vid game shows the documentary,filmed mostly at his one man play/monologue/diatribe on the last two performances should be worth you while reilly recalls his tortured childhood,up thru his late adolescence with a mix of snide humour pained memories how he even got through childhood adolescence with a vile,racist,homophobic control fanatic mother,a alcoholic,manic depressive father,a comatose aunt other dysfunctional family members is a small miracle in itself he also recalls his early years on broadway only after he was rejected by the president of nbc for being gay and his eventual rise as a television celebrity makes this for a film to be taken upon about my only beef is the occasional clumsy camera editing work that makes this film a wee bit of a challenge the camera seems to be everywhere it's not supposed to be more than a few times,plus the framing seems to be way off,giving the film a rather clumsy,home movie look such as ziggy stardust the spiders from mars which was marred by bad camera editing work if you can get past that the life of reilly is one to seek out
