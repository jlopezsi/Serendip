regarding mr fedor markovic comment i would say what we have forgotten is that we belong to the earth we are just part of it not the owners it is as simple as that and this is a quite old tribal basic knowledge that we seem to have forgotten for what i know the gilgamesh poem already dealt with this subject and it was written quite a few years ago we are very clever very civilized advanced human beings but maybe we are not improving maybe we are not progressing but we are declining and we don't remember we don't know how to use our knowledge however i doubt mr markovic can realize he is very comfortable sitting at his sofa
