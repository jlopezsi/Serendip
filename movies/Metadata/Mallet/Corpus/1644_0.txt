while visiting in london i watched bleeder i liked it a lot haven't seen any other danish films but this one is great one of the other people commenting here said it was made on a low budget i certainly wouldn't say it showed heavily there's no real expensive shots crowd scenes explosions etc but everything is shot to scale and looks good especially the cinematography this and the acting are perhaps the strongest elements of the film i kept watching how they had framed each shot and how they would do those angles where one person is in the forground facing the camera with an expression on their face while the other person is off in the background waiting for the foreground person to turn back around great i hope this movie gets distributed in the us
