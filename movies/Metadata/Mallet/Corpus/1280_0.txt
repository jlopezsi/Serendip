nathan lane all but steals the show but this movie is also powered by the likes of victor garber and saul rubinek among others a rich and varied ensemble that aid the cause enormously neil simon has given them a script chock full o laughs with the occasional sappy moment i found the direction lacking and average and the music poor and the location was obviously not new york i'm beginning to recognize canadian cities but overall a very nice effort that hold up with the best of the cable movie genre
