this is without a doubt one of the two worst movies i've ever seen at least movies that were supposed to be good br br alicia silverstone usually a decent actor is simply annoying in this film the usually excellent benicio del toro turns in an embarassingly bad turn as the love interest/kidnapper in fact the only actor of any importance here who performs reasonably well is christopher walken who is the lone bright point in this complete waste of space br br the plot is convoluted flighty and downright dumb the audience has no empathy whatsoever with any of the characters especially with silverstone's nor is she even a cool bad guy in the end indeed 10 minutes into the film not only do we not care at all what happens to her but we rather wish walken would just lose his cool lock her and del toro in a closet someplace and dance away into the sunset to a fatboy slim song br br thank god del toro got his role in traffic because this quite easily could have wrecked his career i don't recommend anyone see this film unless you are just begging for ways to waste your money and torture yourself br br
