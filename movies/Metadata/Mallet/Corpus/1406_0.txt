this movie is not only one of the best horror films of hollywood's golden era but it is also one of the most bizarre movies ever made it is also of great historical importance because it is the first movie that paired bela lugosi and boris karloff the two most venerated iconic figures of the horror genre lugosi plays a man thirsty for revenge and karloff is the man lugosi is after in the midst of high art-deco glory both men battle each other to death it is an old-fashioned good vs evil story redressed with strange sensibilities what is fascinating about the movie is the way the film's antagonists choose to play their deadly games against each other there are no fist fights or scream contests in this movie there is some of that near the end of the film though everything about the movie is hysterical but strangely subdued a contradiction that creates a very unique atmosphere also it is truly unnerving to see that the film's hero the one we are supposed to identify with is probably as insane as the villain lugosi and karloff are simply brilliant i've never seen a better pairing of two actors it's a match made in heaven/hell script sets costumes cinematography everything about the film is top notch a masterpiece of the macabre and one film that gets better and better with each viewing
