this is actually two movies the extensive editing credits suggest that combining the footage into one film must have been challenging on one hand we see a travel movie with some entrancing too brief glimpses of good cinematography diced among it is another movie about the emotional friction between a father and son scenes of painful confessions and tears are followed by jarring shots of a highway or the departures board at an airline terminal the filmmaker chris roe is to be commended for his honesty in that he lets his frequent whining scenes remain in the movie i could have done without any of the frequent references to the expenses of the trip and would like to know more about the father and his background and what about the wife and mother that the father recently divorced but is silent about and how the other two brothers fit into the picture nevertheless this movie is definitely worth watching for any son or father
