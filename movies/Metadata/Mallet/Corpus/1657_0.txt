it's really much too bad that dorthy stratten who was probably one of the prettiest females to grace this planet wasn't around longer to make more and better movies we are left with galaxina and autumn born the former being the much better known of her two movies this movie autumn born is good at what it is which in addition to being a sexploitation movie is almost a perfect text-book account of how to brainwash someone though certainly an unpleasant subject people should realize that this is a real technique that is used upon unwilling people to cause them to be subjective to other people the masters it's a fairly well-made film for a low-budget feature and one of the only two movies you'll find dorthy stratten in so if your a stratten fan or interested in brainwashing then go for it
