if you've seen the classic roger corman version starring vincent price it's hard to put it out of your head but you probably should do because this one is totally different subtlety has been abandoned in favour of gross-out horror nudity gore and all-round unpleasantness ok it's ridiculous trashy sensationalised and historically dubious did any members of the inquisition really wear horn-rimmed glasses but despite all this it is strangely compelling i literally couldn't tear myself away from the screen until the end of the movie if there's a bigger compliment you can pay to a film i don't know what it is
