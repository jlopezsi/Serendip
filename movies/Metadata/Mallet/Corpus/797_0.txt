the alien-episodes have always been my favorites but this one wasn't as great as i hoped for to be honest the black lady in the fbi was pretty darn dumb about the tactics that annoyed me i didn't really understand if duane was lying or not if he was telling the truth why would they add the whole he was shot in the head blabla part and if he was lying the episode would be kind of pointless something that was also annoying was the blinking lights in the alien-scenes i actually had to close my eyes to not get a headache the last scene was good was scary when scully saw duane in the window duane barry was an exciting episode first episode we got to see aliens alive br br best moment when mulder got duane to get to the door br br worst moment when the black lady was talking about the tactics
