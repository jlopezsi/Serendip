i would advise against watching this there's better things to do with your time and/or money if for some reason you are gonna be subjected to this don't expect any elements of many sci-fi/horror films no special effects no gore no sex virtually no attempts so it's a no-no all the way rigid acting illogical continuity the plot is simple rocky uses psychotronic ability to dispense with people and the chicago-area cops get onto his trail as a result psychotronic wasn't in my dictionary but i think that it means that he can will things to happen i suspect that he willed a lot of time in his car my psychotronic powers must need a little work this movie continued for quite a while after i willed it to end
