now i'm not a horror movie fan or anything but i see several thrillers a year and this one is by far the best i've seen br br the acting is just terrific leelee sobieski and stellan skarsgard's best performances to date it is a some-what normal story it's not like aliens are invading earth or there's a haunted mental ward or something br br i guess i do have a couple of complaints though i couldn't figure out why they wouldn't run away from school or call somebody from a safe phone but if they did that there wouldn't be much of film br br but in several scenes even though i know what's going to happen i jump every time the perfect thriller 9/10
