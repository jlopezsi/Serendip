last salute is an episode directed by falk's friend mcgoohan and from start to finish the viewer can enjoy what is almost a pastiche of a crime mystery columbo lingers in the harbor in no hurry at all works together with mac because his boss insists makes him drive his car gets entangled with robert vaughn in the car with the telephone tries tm on the deck of the boat he seems in a jolly mood all the time note how he touches and lays his arms around everyone in this episode it is an episode as calming as the waterfront itself and it probably isn't up to what most viewers expect but that always is a problem we need to accept it as a creative thing too and columbo always had it's own patterns and in-jokes but because of many different directors as well as guest stars and considering the fact that the show ran for 35 years there is no such thing as the one formula it sticks to so it is really quite sad that there are always these remarks the last of the real columbo's the final good episode here's where episodes became to long here's where falk was too old etc etc enjoy every episode for its own merits last salute is in no way possible to be compared with outings like double exposure of a stitch in crime so don't just sit relax and watch this episode and there is no episode like it it is beyond comparison
