here we have yet another hollywood butchering of science fiction unfortunately hollywood executives seem to think that science fiction fans are either idiots who cannot see the cavernous plot holes ala independence day or like the butchery of a good book into a movie that seems to use only the barest plot parts and character names br br times and places are changed it becomes something that only america can solve love stories get thrown in for no sane reason parts that would make the movie seem more plausible and give an insite into the reason for the invasion in the first place are chopped to a couple of minutes the easiest way of identifying who does and doesn't have a slug on their back is completely ignored for some unexplained reason the authorities e.g the president are in almost from the start in the book but not in the movie more than one state is involved in the book compared to three town in the movie in fact the part of the book that involves other countries is completely ignored and in the book there is no happy ending where the hero goes wandering off hand in hand with his obligatory love interest br br judge for yourselves but i bet the rumblings from rah's grave were heard for months after this travesty was foisted on the public
