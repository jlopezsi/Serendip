in my view this is one of potter's most impressive works it has been years since i saw the series on television but i remember it became the highlight of my week the unpredictable plot and the surreal use of day dreams and 50's music was masterful br br louise germaine was brilliantly cast as the stunningly beautiful sylvia she was beautiful that is until she spoke revealing the most dreadful accent a memorable performance even back in the early nineties it was clear that ewan mrgegor was destined to go on to greater things br br highly recommended viewing
