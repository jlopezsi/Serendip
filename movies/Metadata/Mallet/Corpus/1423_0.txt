the best of the collaborations between karloff lugosi the production values are high and karloff's makeup is excellent there is a lot going on it the script perhaps too much as the script is a bit confusing and sometimes pointless but the atmosphere is thick and the aura hangs over the movie like a dense mist there is more horror implied than actually seen this movie has black magic a man skinned alive treachery phobia and a chess game with lives at stake mostly it has great performances by karloff and lugosi in their one and only film appearance as equals without one dominating the other truly this is one of the finest universal horror classics and will deliver everything a fan of such fare could possibly want
