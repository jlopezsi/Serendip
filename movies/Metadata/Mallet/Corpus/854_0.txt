this is not a good movieÂ…for many reasons poor script bad conception spotty acting incompetent technical delivery etc etc we only saw this turkey because there was a mix-up oops on imdb in the theatre schedule which meant we would have to wait an additional half hour for our desired film to remain nameless we should have waited there is so much wrong with this film it is hard to know where to start let me turn this around then and begin with what i liked alan rickman's performance especially in his strange little talks with dennis farina in the former's wine shop that's all br br a few specifics in the bad film department most of the other acting was ho-hum or worse including chris pine too much time on screen and his so-called romantic interest played by rachael taylor to be fair to the latter her character was a walking clich who instead of developing a relationship with the freddie rodriguez role which might have been interesting falls inevitably into the arms of mr pine did i mention racism as another problem so rodriguez is wasted as well as ms dushku who seems to exist primarily as an obvious and lame plot mechanism br br writing this is making me angry all over again so for our collective health i will end this by lighting into the cinematography which was lazy and badly staged my viewing mate spent the film counting technical mistakes because it was so poorly made giving us little sense of the actual locations where the main action was taking place the characters could have been anywhere and wound up nowhere just like the viewing audience who hated it as much as i did
