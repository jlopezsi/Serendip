beverly hills cop ii is the entertaining sequel to the 1984 smash hit of course this sequel can't top the original but it's still pretty good eddie murphy returns as axel foley and returns to beverly hills to help avenge the attack of a friend this movie isn't as fresh as the original movie but i found myself laughing alot throughout plus the action scenes are well done judge reinhold john ashton ronny cox and paul reiser all reprise their roles from the first film along with murphy beverly hills cop ii is a movie that's loud and noisy at times but it's funny and entertaining and it's much better than the disappointing third movie in the series beverly hills cop iii br br out of four
