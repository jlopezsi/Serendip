simply one of the best hard boiled noir films i have seen sterling hayden is as usual excellent while a very young charles bronson is surprisingly good as a punk hood seems to feature nearly all scenes as location or hand-held camera and it seems at times like a particularly effective episode of a 50s tv cop show except that the content is much more brutal and sharp this is a dark dark film both in storyline and in the quite brilliant photography i'd really love to see this neglected classic come out on a restored print on dvd isn't it time criterion updated their noir list this cries out for restoration and a re-release
