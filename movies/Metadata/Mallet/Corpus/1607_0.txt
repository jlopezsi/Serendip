i recently saw this magnificent film after not having seen it in quite a number of years william wyler's extraordinary direction makes this movie a classic that will live forever br br mr wyler had at his disposal the best of what his studio could give him in this film based on the play by owen davis he was at the top of his form with the help of the great cinematographer ernest haller and that fabulous costume designer orry-kelly he gives us a movie that will stand as one of the best of that period melodramas the great walter huston was an assistant director under wyler br br there are some people who have written comments about jezebel expressing how much better it could have been had it been done in color personally i don't think so just look at the closing scenes of the picture to witness the master camera work of mr haller showing a close up of ms davis the effect of light and shadow is almost comparable to a painting bette davis reacts to the camera with an economy of gestures and yet she speaks volumes of what is going on inside her soul br br technicolor would have been the ruin of this film at the beginning of its invention this new process was too harsh the film wouldn't have kept the glorious look it still possesses had it been shot in color as far as the red dress being more visible in sharp contrast with the white costumes of the other young women at the ball the black and white effect is more dramatic br br william wyler was very lucky with the amazing cast he assembled for the film bette davis and henry fonda were at their prime when they appeared in jezebel bette davis is what holds the film together with her magnetism and star performance it's almost impossible to think of another actress of that period giving as good a performance as ms davis br br there are also people that have compared jezebel with gone with the wind the only thing they had in common is the fact that both take place in the period before the war between the states but that's as far as the similarities end this was a stage play which by the way was not very successful when miriam hopkins and tallulah bankhead appeared in it br br this is a film to be treasured thanks to william wyler
