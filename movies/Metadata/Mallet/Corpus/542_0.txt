four snotty rich kids at a prep school in england want to get out of a field trip to wales where they would have to eat fish paste sandwiches and be otherwise uncomfortable they also don't want to get out of the trip by just returning home over the school break two are male friends mike steel desmond harrington son of a rock star and geoff bingham laurence fox and two are female friends elizabeth dunn thora birch and frances almond smith keira knightley frances and geoff have had an intimate relationship although any relationship between them seems very tenuous and elizabeth has had a crush on mike for a long time mike was otherwise going out with another girl but she had just dumped him one of them knows or knows someone who knows the perfect getaway spot secluded and private just right for promoting an intimate extended weekend of partying an old war bunker deep underground in the middle of a forest the bunker is accessed via a circular thick steel door and is lined with thick reinforced concrete the four end up trapped in the bunker with the door locked and no way to get out for at least 10 days who locked them in and why how will they get out br br if you're someone who only likes straightforward plots traditionally happy endings and films depicting facts that are close to what you believe to be true about the actual world you're best advised to avoid the hole if you instead do not mind or even prefer circuitous twisted tales with strong fantasy elements in this case primarily to enable what amounts to a parable and fairly nihilistic endings you may find much to love here reflecting the film's overall ambiguity the hole resides in a gray genre area between thriller psychological horror and a straight-ahead drama the first half hour or so is much more straightforward and for me the film was cruising along at about an 8 for at least that length of time but as it progressed and things became much more bizarre and evil my score gradually rose with the extended climax being a firm 10 for me so my rating on this one is more of an average br br the plot from a screenplay by first time and only time so far scripters ben court and caroline ip based on a novel by guy burt is unusual for being told primarily from unreliable characters perspectives we learn most of the story through the testimony of a victim elizabeth and a primary suspect martyn taylor daniel brocklebank who may in fact be a friend of elizabeth's their accounts change as the film progresses often framing different characters as victims and perpetrators and the bulk of what we see on screen are depictions of these changing accounts thus we see some repeating material it's important to show parts of the story again as the supposed facts about the story change br br stemming from this it's easy to see that the performances are quite good most characters undergo subtle alterations for the different instantiations of the story and the four principals birch harrington fox and knightley adeptly transform themselves aided also by their clothing hair and makeup br br court and ip cleverly do not change the scenario as much as you might expect after the first couple variations it keeps you on your toes as to just who the perpetrator was but also enables a surprising and in-depth exploration of the psychotic personality and motivation behind the lock-in whoever the perpetrator was and i certainly won't reveal the film's answer here they were clearly somewhat insane we're also led to be skeptical about the material that's relayed from an ostensibly third-person point of view it's never clear for most events just what is meant to be objective and true versus what is still the potential fantasy of the storyteller personally i love that kind of ambiguity some others do not like it so much br br the hole is also a bit of an exploration of spoiled kids all of the main characters are manipulators who are used to getting whatever they want they all seem to have an attitude that their intellect is far superior to almost every one else and thus they're entitled to whatever they desire as well as justified in whatever it takes to get it that's a classic disposition of many criminals and not a few business leaders politicians internet geeks and so on it's notable that when the students parents appear which is very seldom they are distant and mostly dissociated from their offspring who have come to rule the roost as far as we can tell the investigators trying to piece together the case come to know this although they never directly state as much but the performers give very subtle clues to their complex realizations as the story goes on we can see them also gradually losing hope that they'll be able to properly sort the events out and reveal the truth br br the hole can be seen as a parable about how far some may go to get what they want as well as how far co-conspirators may go before they try to divorce themselves from events gone wrong there are clues throughout the film that other characters had various levels of knowledge and involvement it's also an exploration of what makes some go as far as they do and what makes conspirators play along at the same time it comments on the bewilderment of outsiders trying to figure out how some horrific event developed a lot of the answers are appropriately ambiguous under the guises of the subtexts as well as on a more visceral surface level the film is a great success
