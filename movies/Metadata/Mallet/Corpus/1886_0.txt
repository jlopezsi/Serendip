to be labelled as the most bizarrely bewildering title of all slasher movies may not seem like much of a memorable claim but when you consider the fact that the forerunner is up against such twisted beasts as blood harvest don't open til christmas pieces bloodbeat and the almost extra terrestrial a day of judgement then you begin to realise how tough a challenge it really is when it comes to leaving you dumbfounded and gasping at the screen jaw dropped quicker than if you just received a shattering right hook from mike tyson then horror house on highway five has crossed the finish line while the others are still tying up their shoe-laces a true true masterpiece of brain-numbing confusion highway five is about as anormalistic as any movie could ever possibly achieve to be inside this solar system br br some of the strange images that will appear on your screen over the 90 minute runtime include a homicidal maniac in a richard nixon mask that may well be a dead scientist and is played by an actor named ronald reagan seriously then there are the two demented kidnappers one of them believing that his brain is being destroyed by parasites while the other acts equally like the mushrooms that he ate with his fried breakfast were certainly those of the magic variety and how could i forget the gang of college half wits who have the intelligence of an autistic bullfrog on crack then there's the wacky soundtrack that includes everything from st peppers-era beatles style trip-rock to dion and the belmonts-type doo-wop br br a college class investigating the creation of the v2 rocket head out to a small town brilliantly titled little town where it was believed that the german scientist behind the invention spent his final days in america legend dictates that before his disappearance frederick bartholomew became a murderous psychopath and began killing off the people that he worked with one young student sally smith is given the task of interviewing two of the scientist's former associates the crazed dr mabuser and his stuttering sidekick gary meanwhile a maniac dressed as tricky dicky is heading along highway 5 bumping off anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with him will the classmates escape the secluded town alive is that really richard nixon trying to murder his way back into the white house all the answers lie behind the front door of the horror house on highway 5 br br if anything richard casey's debut certainly proves that there are some strange people inhabiting this planet and a fair majority of them were working on the set of this feature circa 1985 you'd think that at some point during the long months of pre and post production at least one member of the cast or crew would have said hold on a second isn't this all just a little far-fetched but no it seems that the copious amounts of lsd that were handed out as inspirational materials throughout the writing of the screenplay were still in abundance during the shoot there's really no other way to explain occurrences such as the second victim throwing herself through a glass coffee table for no reason whatsoever whilst the killer was hot on his heels behind her it was only moments earlier that she had been pulling strange faces at herself in the mirror the kind of thing that you would do if you had been in swallowing lsd for the past twenty-four hours it may also be the real truth behind mike and louise's cool attitude when they find a disembowelled cat mysteriously dumped in the back of their van if you were hallucinating consistently then you'd expect to see that kind of thing surely oh and before i forget dr mabuser seems to believe that his brain is being munched by maggots need i say more br br the dramatics are exactly what you've come to expect from zero budget slasher movies you know the kind of performances that make your children's high school play look like one flew over the cuckoo's nest part deux there's one starlet that really gave new meaning to the word wooden she was that bad i reckon that she'd make the rain forest look like it was made of lego the highlight of her brief performance came as she was being murdered by the former president with the enthusiasm of a dry roasted peanut she yelped relax just try to put your mind at ease yeah right don't expect to see her popping up in any other motion pictures any time soon br br this does at least try in many ways to add a little spice to the hack and slash cycle alongside the traditional masked maniac there's at least three other nut jobs to keep you interested and there's even a hint at the supernatural that's never completely followed through it's also worth noting that richard casey didn't go for that old slasher chestnut of having a cast full of pretty boys and page 3 girls to dismember instead most of the body count is pretty average in the looks department except for maybe the final girl who was cute if not breathtakingly beautiful oh yeah and a word of advice to all t&a fans there's nothing but dungarees and double knits going on here you've more chance of seeing forbidden flesh on an episode of sesame street than you have anywhere in this fully wrapped splatter flick br br my conclusion is that highway five was either invaded by otherworldly beings on set was intended as a spoof or is simply a misunderstood masterpiece one thing is for certain however for all its nonsensical frolics and wayward attempts at terror it sure makes a fine advertisement for watching the telly
