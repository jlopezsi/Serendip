radioactive dreams is comparable to both my science project and city limits two dirt-budget science fiction films with great ideas and a decent cast unfortunately trampled by a nickle-shooting budget ironically they all starred or co-starred john stockwell br br granted radioactive dreams was at least an interesting plot which is the only reason i gave it a 2-star rating two idyllic young men not coincidentally named phillip and marlowe stockwell and dudikoff abandoned by their fathers grow up in a bomb shelter following the nuclear destruction of their planet decide it's time to leave the shelter and live out their 1950s comic-book inspired fantasy of being two of the greatest private detectives which of course lends to a running gag only when they get outside their idealism is quickly floundered when their chivalrous assistance of a young girl chased by nuclear mutants inadvertently leads to dangerous and disastrous flirtations with the darkside the girl as it turns out leaves them custody of a pair of highly-sought keys that control a nuclear missile ironically and thus like sam and frodo in lord of the rings they've got to keep these keys from getting in the wrong hands and that sure ain't easy br br unfortunately for the most part the execution is crap it involves a lot of warehouse footage bad acting especially an abundance of girlish screams from dudikoff cheap effects a sappy ending involving a little-expected parental reunion and a longer-than-necessary finale the mid-80s atmosphere could have provided all the necessary spunk and attitude that would have provided the perfect touch to a unique story as this phillip and marlowe are not the only ones trapped in a cultural generation of their own i particularly love the deadly disco kids a penchant for cursing but once again a scrap shooting budget posed lots of limitations not to mention br br worth it a shot at least for the story but otherwise it's about the same muddle film as city limits though certainly not as bad of the three films mentioned however i would recommend watching my science project instead
