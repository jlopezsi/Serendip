despite the best efforts of hoolywood you occasionally still see a compelling drama and this is one swimmers reveals some very universal themes familiar to most of us who have ever lost a job had a sick child or difficult relationships surely this is nearly everyone the small town setting is wonderful and the economic plight of the oysterman is painful to watch the disappearing way of life that is so common in many rural areas br br i was stunned by the actors performances and the beauty of the setting juxtaposed with the pain in their lives really a great story with a lot to say about us br br oh yeah cherry jones 2005 tony award winner was awesome in this film but she was not the best performance this one is worth your time and effort
