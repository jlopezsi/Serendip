the appearance of michelle yeoh in tomorrow never dies and then crouching tiger hidden dragon piqued my interest in the lady's earlier films and when this one came up cheap on dvd i jumped at the chance to acquire it i am glad i did it is not the greatest film i have ever seen but it is good fun and includes some good fight stuff michelle yeoh looks terrific and does some great fight scenes and all with a great sense of fun this is one film not to be taken seriously and the result is a great way of spending 90 minutes if you like mindless action with a touch of humour then you could do a lot worse than this film check it out
