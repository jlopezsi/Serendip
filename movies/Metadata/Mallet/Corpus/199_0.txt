if you are feeling bad i advise you do not watch this movie wonderfully done i think the best comment is anothers in that this movie puts the prequels of star wars to color by numbers shame there is so much to this it's just breathtaking the shooting is done well the acting is superb and it puts sadako in to a totally new light and will really force you to think a bit more about ring and it's sequels it's difficult for me to put this in words but trust me this is very much a movie to see without fail you will enjoy it greatly though i promise you you will be very depressed by it then again if you expect a happy ending from a ring movie you haven't watched any of the others and i do mean any though some are bittersweet none end truly happily
