well the movie's idea or theme was unique but the movie itself was not found satisfying in my opinion i like some of its ideas about how nicole kidman's character was shown through her actions as well as some of the times when she was watching a movie with her fianc her mood changes slowly as she is trying to get over a shock by pretending to be watching the movie br br but for every occasion that comes up in the movie it is extremely long makes you think they wasted a lot of the movie time on mere extension of the situation the way they wasted so much time was ridiculous this includes the very beginning part of the movie when a man wearing black is running they were trying out something new something different but to me i found that whatever they were trying to do didn't work out quite well i really didn't like it and i found that i wasted my time watching this movie that centers around only one idea
