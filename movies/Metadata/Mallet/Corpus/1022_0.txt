even though i have ambiguous estimations about this film on the whole i can only say for sure that satanico pandemonium is a must-see nunsploitation mexican flick for anyone who can be pleased about these kinds of movies for their evident ridiculousness this is one of those flicks that have too many flaws and no plot whatsoever but it's still impossible not to like them for some imprecise cause the acting is not exactly academy award material and it causes unintended laughter the special effects in which we see the concept of satan and temptation itself represented on a laughable guy naked is by far one of the most hysterical things about this film along with the outrageously shabby sound effects during these strange apparitions the whole thing just looks too tacky and the look on the guy's face is simply priceless so how can anyone not love it i know some people could take it as a reason to overthrow the director's gracious effort but i myself found it too silly not to like it without offering an actual share of real horror satanico pandemonium manages to get the attention even if it is by some means erroneously advertised there are some noble allocations of gore here and there but the film mostly focuses on the drama and eroticism the first half an hour happens to be ineffective in a way and that would be the only reasons why i felt compelled to turn it off throughout the first minutes and leave it incomplete it contains no dialogs no action and for the most part only a nice display of beautiful mexican landscapes which is not exactly enough to make it endurable however it is only a matter of persistence to realize that after the big unnecessary moments of silence and boredom the story starts to develop some of the most astonishing states of affairs in which we see lesbian soft-core sex between two nuns a nun taking advantage of a teenage boy and some enjoyable bloody murders inside the convent without anything else to add i can only recommend sat√°nico pandemonium to anyone who is in the mood for a decent nunsploitation drama with some utterly random sexual scenes a couple of nice murders to attach at least a small share of horror to the story a badly placed background story of racism and of course lots of sexy and sinful nuns
