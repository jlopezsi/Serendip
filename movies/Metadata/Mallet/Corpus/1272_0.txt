the point of this film was not as much to be great art as it was to educate people about the holocaust in that sense i think that many posters here are unfairly blasting it holding it up to some high artistic standard believe it or not there are many in this world especially younger people who have not clue one about the atrocities committed against the jewish people this film would be an excellent introduction along with other films such as diary of anne frank for young people into this very real and recent historical nightmare to read comments here about how bad the german accents were and how the germans deserve better than this lead me to suspect the sincerity of those posting them
