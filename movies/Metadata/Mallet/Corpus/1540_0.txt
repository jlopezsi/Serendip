this was directed by cecil b demille who was an overrated hack and most of his movies sucked except a few in the 1930's like cleopatra and the crusades this movie has a great cast that includes ray milland john wayne paulette goddard raymond massey and also susand hayword and charles bickford in small roles wayne doesn't have the starring role and he and milland are both in love with goddard but she can't make up her mind massey is the villain who sinks other ships so he can get the cargo but wayne and milland don't trust each other and they strike up an uneasy partnership that doesn't go over too well it's a decent movie but i couldn't help thinking that john ford would of done a much better job of directing this movie
