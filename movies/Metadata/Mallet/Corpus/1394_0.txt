there is a lot of criticism mostly negative on this board about this film which i can't understand i have never seen the original film version with norma shearer but it appears not to be bowdlerized like this one but bowdlerized or not this is a very good film br br it has a first rate cast led by crawford who was capable of comedy but opted for dramatic intense roles like mildred pierce as the role calls for her to be compromised by her actions she has masqueraded as a socialite to be accepted by the jaded aristocrats in order to pull off a jewel robbery the role is not a slap happy funny part like say rosalind russell's hildy johnson but a tonier style of sophisticated comedy as such it is perfectly fitted to crawford's screen persona br br as for the jaded aristocrats frank morgan may not do a british accent at all but his fumbling is pretty good here he is the richest man in england and could give an intelligent talk on industrial output or tariffs but cannot open up his heart to crawford nigel bruce is another nobleman who has a randy set of eyes for pretty ladies and cannot see his wife benita hume is far too close to her cousin ralph forbes the splendid jessie ralph is an aging dowager who befriends crawford it is her pearl necklace that crawford is seeking to steal she is a lively and likable old lady and one with a scandalous past as we eventually learn but if none of the aristocrats are spotless in character except possibly the boring morgan the other members of the gang are not wonderful melville cooper pretending to be crawford's chauffeur is constantly ready to whip out his handy knife and cut the throat of anyone he thinks is double crossing them br br but the most interesting thing about the casting were the two leading men robert montgomery and william powell the two most sophisticated and suave leading men of the golden age of movies only appeared in this one film together they share only four scenes but it is remarkable about how smooth the scenes are like a perfect set of volleyball games with no shots and counter shots missed by either party and when crawford joins them she is equally smooth in responding to both her leading men she had made other films with montgomery but there were no others after this one as for powell this was there only film together as such it should be seen for the bright chemistry between the three leads alone but it is a good comedy on its own
