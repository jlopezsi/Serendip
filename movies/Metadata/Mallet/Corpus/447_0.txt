this is a wonderful film and one can tell that it's definitely a labor of love br br i must say that i was disturbed by the drug use scene with stephen however this is because i am a former addict but i still think it was unnecessary to be so graphic but he truly shares the perils of heroin addiction in the most real way br br i do wonder how the movie will turn out i can't believe the amount of energy wayne possesses toward his projects i found him to be a great role model i am an artist myself and quite lazy by comparison br br only one more complaint like in many documentaries they will tease you with the beginning of a wonderful song then speak over it or cut away i could have used less talk and more music since this is what the documentary is ultimately about well beside their lives and the creative process br br i highly recommend this film oh and yes it is a bit too long but it only proves how engaged the filmmaker is in the project
