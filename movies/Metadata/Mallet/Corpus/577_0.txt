about thirty minutes into the film i thought this was one of the weakest columbo"s ever because it had the usual beginning a murder happening then columbo coming inspecting everything and interrogating the main suspect squared it was boring because i thought i knew everything already br br but then there was a surprising twist that turned this episode into a most exciting one suddenly many characters were involved i started to guess with columbo and the ending was just like agatha christie's poirot endings are br br the film is full of irony and looking back i must admit that the whole episode is great work of the writers because the ordinary first part is a mere tool for creating this irony creating a huge fool-the-audience-scenario don't turn your television off before the end
