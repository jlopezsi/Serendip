i would compare this to talk to her and heaven the protagonist commits a terrible crime but turns out to be a likable guy the murder is over and done with quickly br br after that i laughed a lot this is more of a romantic comedy than a drama the characters are somewhat over the top especially keiko's mother the weird thing is the chaste romance story the lack of pdas and kissing in a movie with sex and nudity is disorienting high contrast between a reserved traditional japanese culture and frank subject matter not for kids beaultifully shot the director is world famous for good reason
