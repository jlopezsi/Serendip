this film was clearly tailor written for robert de niro not only is he the finest character actor of his generation perhaps even the finest since james stewart his italian background which he has portrayed so well in films in the past such as his 2 oscar winners the godfather part 2 and raging bull comes through excellently and adds much credibility to the role br br at the same time billy crystal's natural sarcastic manner is a great anathema to de niro and even the role of the usually poor lisa kudrow as crystal's wife is well cast br br one of the most subtle and funniest certainly for hollywood comedies of recent years the digs at the stereotypical mafia image are both cutting and cynical but damn funny at the same time br br the whole concept of a psychiatrist for a mafia racketeer is funny enough as it is and with the natural chemistry between crystal and de niro this really is a rare off-beat treat
