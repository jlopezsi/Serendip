i saw this film years ago when it first came out at the cinema even after the first 10 minutes i found myself laughing at the apparently serious film the special effects were bad with the exception of a computer generated sequence at the end of the film and the melting plasticine woman was good too hmm the low budget was especially visible when a microsoft natual keyboard is seen in the film obviously a high-tech computer would need one if you have nothing better to do and love anything sci-fi then watch it you might get a laugh out of it
