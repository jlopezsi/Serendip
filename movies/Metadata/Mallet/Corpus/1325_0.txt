tony gatlif has made two films about european gipsy life latjo drom and gadjo dilo if you have prejudices about this ethnic group he doesn't do anything to make them smaller but that's not really the important point not in vengo which is gatlif's best movie so far br br it takes courage to start the film with ten minutes mixture of a flamenco/arabian music performance and where are more of it later on the interesting thing is that the film doesn't lose any tempo from it br br this is a story about sacrifice and love inside an ethnic group the people seems to be criminals in some way all of them but still they are sympathetic or if not sympathetic interesting gatlif knows how to tell a story and so he does here great acting especially by antonio canales and orestes villasan rodriguez
