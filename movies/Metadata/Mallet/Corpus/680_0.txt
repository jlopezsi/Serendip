if you're one of those people who quite enjoyed la pacte des loups brotherhood of the wolf a few years back but were left disappointed by some of the more ridiculous historical inaccuracies then you might want to take a look at romasanta br br the story of manuel blanco romasanta is quite a well known one in spain it happened in the mid-nineteenth century when a string of violent deaths took place which seemed in some ways like animal attacks and in others like cold and calculated murder eventually a man was arrested manuel romasanta and it was found that he used the body fat from his victims to make soap at his trial he claimed that he became a werewolf and that it is the nature of a wolf to kill he was diagnosed with the psychological condition of lycanthropy and given a life sentence rather than death br br the film itself is based largely on truth partly on speculation and partly on pure invention for artistic purposes it's certainly a lot closer to the truth than brotherhood of the wolf was anyway one character is knowingly invented and some rather unlikely theories are put forward in the place of that which is unknown but the question of whether or not romasanta was actually a werewolf is left completely open paco plaza appears to be a competent and innovative director and the style of the film is really superb it is quite slow moving and arguably it's rather light on actual story and plot but that's about as far as the criticism goes br br there are several great performances but the standout comes from julian sands as the title character who submerges himself in the role in the way that only outstanding actors can john sharian is also very good as the misguided haunted partner of romasanta and both gary piquer and david gant are memorable in supporting roles as those who finally bring the murderer to justice it also features elsa pataky as the leading heroine who has become a huge sex symbol in spain and it isn't hard to see why think along the lines of a spanish keira knightley br br this is the finest historical werewolf film i've ever seen and any self-respecting werewolf buff should take a look but unfortunately there's not much chance of this one being a blockbuster
