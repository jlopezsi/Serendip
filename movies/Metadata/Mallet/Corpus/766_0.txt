i have been after this movie for years if you like learning about other cultures predominantly indian tribes or if are an environmentalist or ecologist you will love the movie also any parent will feel for the main characters it is truly touching how the family never gives up looking for their lost son and risk everything for that cause it is true that the ending is unexpected but it shows the intentions of the father were to give up his dream to give his son and new life a chance to survive in the amazon there is light nudity for the children but it is convincingly part of the story line i will share this movie with my eleven year old environmentalist as soon as i can get it
