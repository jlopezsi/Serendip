this is a wonderful character driven story of how the often crushing economics of life as a waterman can drive a family apart there are so many nuances in the performances its hard to know where to start but let's just say the women drive the action here with a wonderful debut in tara gallagher as emma the eleven year old narrator of the tale and cherry jones as her mother julia and sarah paulson as the emotionally damaged merrill these casting choices were excellent and all bring an understated core to their performances that are perfectly drawn out by director doug sadler working from his own screenplay robert knott as julia's down and out husband will tyler evokes a younger robert duvall or ed harris and is pitch perfect in his portrayal of a man trying very hard against odds that are not breaking his way if you are looking for an antidote to the violence and mayhem that passes for movie-making these days you can take heart that in this fantastic film solid writing and acting and the focused emotions of small town life in america make for a terrific story and one that you should not miss
