i had read about this film on a site about time-travel movies my favorite type of films and had been waiting for it to come out on dvd this has happened in the usa and also in the uk and belgium not so in france however where the film is totally unknown a strange state of affairs for a country which is only now trying to atone for its treatment of its jewish population of 60 years ago whereas in most other countries all that is past history br br i have read other comments about this film and there seem to be equal amounts of negative and positive comments for my part i firmly come out in favour of the film picture quality is excellent so is the acting i do have qualms on certain issues the camps seem too clean and too small the nazis don't seem evil enough but this is a very subjective judgement and all really depends on what the spectator is looking for obviously he/she who prefers the more sordid and the more violent and therefore supposedly the more realistic though that's a question for debate the better will be disappointed true the film is somewhat sanitized but this shortcoming if it can be termed as such is secondary i see the film not as a documentary on the holocaust nor a piece of anti-nazi propaganda but rather the journey of a young lady thru time into a fantasy world where she is taught the importance of her heritage other people have made the point which i agree on that the film is an efficient way of introducing the holocaust to children who may be ignorant of it and on that score alone justifies its having been made br br obviously there is a moralistic tone you-don't-care-about-your heritage-so-i'm-going-to-teach-you-a-lesson-you-won't-forget but beyond that it's interesting to see how the young protagonist passes from modern life and body tattoos to completely different surroundings and somehow adapts to it it is like someone being suddenly whisked from this life for example blown up in an explosion and immediately reincarnating another body in another time frame of course each and every one of us would react differently to this situation but the film on that level at least seems highly plausible though obviously no one really knows what the experience would be like br br the film then should not be taken as a documentary on the holocaust there are plenty of those around with far more realistic and gruesome pictures but it is a journey into fantasy and will doubtless please the school of thought that maintains that one's heritage is all-important to be able to appreciate one's life today br br the fact that in 2005 we are commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the camps of death may have something to to with this film suddenly being issued on dvd in a certain number of countries
