menu the burp of a nation 8/10 br br this little ditty shows up occasionally on tcm so you might be lucky as i was to accidentally run across it in the ending minutes of a tivo recording of a classic movie the running time states that it is 10 minutes in length but it seems much shorter than that br br the short centers on a housewife and her feeble attempts at cooking her kitchen is in a shambles everything she touches produces a sound effect and a wise crack from an omnipotent narrator pete smith away from home the husband sits in his office worrying about what his wife will be concocting in the kitchen for his consumption when he gets home meanwhile at the office his belly is aching so he is never far from his bicarbonate of soda which he keeps in his jacket pocket br br the narrator keeps everything moving along very nicely as he throws in one liners puns and wry observations of the hapless couple the narrator also punctuates the proceedings by not only dropping in many appropriate sound effects but also by bringing to life a chef to manage the wife's dinner arrangements in a puff of smoke the chef enters into the kitchen and proceeds to teach the wife how to stuff a duck and bake some apples br br when the husband comes home the chef has disappeared and so has the husband's bicarbonate the husband has a meal fit for a king but he'll only be king for a day i don't think this wife could make a bowl of cereal br br after watching this short i thought it was made sometime during the 1940's but was completely shocked to see while on imdb a release date of 1933 i didn't know they used color as early as that br br very short very tasty and easily digestible 8/10 br br clark richards
