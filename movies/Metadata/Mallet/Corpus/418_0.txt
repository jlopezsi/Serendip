at first glance it was a little bit disappointment when i saw melissa p i had an expectation that melissa p herself would have played in this movie but maria valverde was really fitted in the role either with appearance or with talent in spite of the movie has been showed with the sign 18 circle when we look at the scenes in reality it deserves a sign 15 circle there was an incompatibility with the books itself and the movie some parts had failed to hit some parts have been drawn into the scenes fast and verbally that makes the story snapped maybe because of the movie depends on a memoir not on a complete scenario it seemed that at the end of the movie melissa had commit a suicide then she appeared on surface and visited her father's mother nonna elvira's grave with her mother it was a misty scenario not open as we understood as if melissa quit these kinds of sex games and correct her communication with her mother forever when she realized she was in wrong way it is not easy to find a right way after diving too deep in the book melissa did not stop playing games
