a small us military group are sent to a deserted island to dispose any live bombs when they get there something not quite right as they find out that they're expendable objects who would soon encounter one vengeful alien through an old hermit on the island they discover that this was a place where they kept an alien species and experimented on them not only they have an angry et to face but military intelligence who plan to use them as bait br br while this is the third of the xtro series there's no relation between the three films predator heavily influences this tacky straight-to video sci-fi fare one thing definitely is that predator is a definite masterpiece when compared to this cheap hokey and pitifully vapid effort even the actors here make schwarzenegger look good very embarrassing execution disastrously inept special effects and daft performances may you think oh no there goes another one of my brain cells when watching this one-of-a-kind piece of trash the stuffy film is amateurishly put together with a clich√©d narrative that's shamelessly derivative reckless characters act tough and spit out macho dribble with attitude it's pretty mind numbing to listen to especially when it goes for meaningful conversations streaming through is a husky voice-over and a lot white rabbits to hold your attention yeah there's something engaging about those white fluffy rabbits br br despite finding it quite an irritable and drab viewing few things hit the mark there are some quite nasty moments when the rubbery alien decides it's torture time with some blood squirting the thunderous music score manages a few chilling cues while the performances are laughably hopeless but robert culp and a slightly amusing andrew divoff are the odd exception while the make-up effects of the outer space visitor are questionable it still manages to hold up for its tiny budget br br director harry bromley who also directed the first two flicks is really clutching at straws with this flatly handled and too practical project imaginative details gripping suspense and bug-eyed visuals are long gone here no techniques really stand out in this by the numbers exercise and what he comes up with is mostly ridiculous and ineffective br br poorly done garbage that turns into a wearisome puddle
