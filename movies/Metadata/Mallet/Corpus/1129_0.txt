i started watching the man thinking that the film was going to be one of the worst movies i have seen in my entire life.but,there was a surprise:the film was only very bad,but not one of the worst movies i have ever seen.that's the best thing i can say about this bad film.the movie is predictable and the formula it has is very used.the story is irrelevant and the film is crap from the beginning until the end.eugene levy and samuel l.jackson are excellent actors but they are wasted here.the script is simply pathetic director les mayfield continues with his pathetic career(which includes craps like flubber and blue streak the man is a pathetic film and i do not recommend it
