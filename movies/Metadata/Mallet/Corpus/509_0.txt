i saw this at the waterfront film festival in saugatuck michigan br br interesting documentary about people that make a career out of being movie extras it followed ten people around and showed how they handle being another face in the movie crowd i really enjoyed this film because i'm interested in going into the film business and it would be fun to be an extra in at least one film br br it was great seeing how dedicated some of these people are the documentary covered many of the basics about being an extra how to get cast in a film how to dress how to act around the big stars and many other things i also loved how they showed the film clips and pointed out where the stars of the documentary were br br this movie will be really helpful to anyone that wants to travel out west and go into the movies
