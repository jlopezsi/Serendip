turner classic movies showed this silent b&w flick today aug 29 2007 on tv br br solid classic adventure story complete with all of the key ingredients exotic plot locations a beautiful woman in peril a pair of dauntless and resourceful heroes one of them handsome the other colorful grossly outnumbered by badguys sprinkled with comic relief great costumes and sets as good or better than those of current movies surprising variety of camera craft and directorship pans and zooms including overhead angles and closeups of key characters and objects in this regard again it seems like a modern movie actions convey the story very well without the benefit of a soundtrack of course this entails a considerable degree of live type acting similar to that seen in plays but i did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies br br the most enjoyable performance is played by louis wolheim as the rough edged but colorful sgt peter o'gaffney who was perfectly casted for the role considering both appearance and skill br br there were at least a few peculiar facts about muslim society that i had previously learned over the past several years which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy br br my favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous sword wielding arabs through the narrow streets of a busy muslim city suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it's time for afternoon prayer everyone out on the streets except for the heroes religiously obeys islamic law and momentarily kneels down which allows the heroes to escape that scene was just one example of the film's many expressions of originality br br after seeing this movie i better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier
