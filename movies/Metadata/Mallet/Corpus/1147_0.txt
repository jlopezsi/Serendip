as the movie opens detroit batf agent derrick vann samuel l jackson is having a really bad day his partner has been murdered and he's a suspect a storehouse of firearms has been stolen from the evidence locker and he's a suspect internal affairs officers headed up by actor miguel ferrar issue warnings and ultimatums and his lieutenant susie essman is none too happy about any of these things vann isn't either but at least he decides to try to do something about it br br meanwhile a few hundred miles to the west in the great state of wisconsin dental equipment salesman andy fidler eugene levy is preparing to give a major speech at a sales convention to be held in what a surprise detroit his speech is in fine order and his flight is uneventful but when andy arrives in detroit his simple decision to get a bite to eat lands him right in the middle of the sting operation vann has set up in an attempt to get the guns back nab his partner's real killer and clear his own name br br fidler who innocently exhibits the signs a go-between is looking for ends up in possession of one of the stolen firearms worse the bad guys now think he's their buyer vann knows he has only one chance to make the deal and so he forcibly enlists an uncooperative and entirely naive andy to play along faced with certain unattractive choices andy does his best to work with vann his best unfortunately isn't much and even manages to alleviate some of the suspicions held by the gun dealer's representative joey luke goss br br as the deal progresses in fits starts mishaps and misunderstandings internal affairs continues to surveil vann in the hopes of nabbing themselves a cop gone bad more bodies pile up vann has personal problems and andy ends up in jail worried he'll miss giving his speech there's a lot going on in the man and all of it happens in 90 or so minutes that it will seem a whole lot longer says something about the film and it's not saying anything very nice br br samuel l jackson is a good actor though he doesn't appear to be slacking off here there's nothing anyone could do about the horrible lines he's given i think eugene levy is a hoot he's just wonderful as the earnest father in the american pie trilogy but he's not remotely funny in this movie that's probably because none of his lines are remotely funny miguel ferrar's ia investigator is a caricature at best susie essman is a woman in a man's world artificially made ridiculously prickly by you guessed it some really stupid lines br br the direction isn't terrible though there are some edits that are but the screenplay is truly abysmal the storyline is obvious as all get-out and the script is trite at best at other times it degenerates from trite directly to could this be any dumber both the director and the writing team have some experience under their respective belts though the résumés don't contain any films of particular note so they all should have been better than this that they aren't makes me wonder how it is they ever got the green light to go ahead with what is obviously intended to be a mass market release br br is the man a comedy no i know that because it isn't funny unless you think really badly handled fart jokes are good humor is it a cop movie not really there are stereotypes everywhere but no real cop action or even jargon is it a drama seeing as how it's utterly missing any drama or suspense i'd give that a no too so what exactly is the man just a really bad movie br br i frankly feel bad for the actors caught up in this mess each and every one of them deserves better in honesty though i feel even worse for those movie-goers who either intentionally and with high hopes or by default end up enduring this film entertainment weekly magazine gave the man a d grade i think that's wrong a d is a passing grade and the man is a complete failure br br political notes in a movie that intends a federal agency to comprise a major part of the framework for the storyline you'd think the scriptwriters could at least get the name of the agency right but they don't although the batf has been the batfe bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives for several years now it's referenced only as batf in the film the movie also gets it wrong when it represents the agents as the good guys batfe has a terrible reputation among other federal agencies and a worse one with gun owners deserved on both counts it's only wishful thinking that they'd also be as inept as the movie presents br br family suitability the man is rated pg-13 for language rude dialogue and some violence i frankly found the entire movie offensive as an insult to my intelligence in a scantly occupied theatre friday night nobody else laughed either as a result i don't believe this movie is suitable for anyone of any age anyone old enough to follow the shallow plot line say 10 or so and up is also plenty aware enough to resent having wasted the money on this drivel i'd recommend that you go see something anything else if the kids insist be aware that the fart jokes are harmless and the violence isn't graphic the language does get rough in places though so if you find that objectionable you've another good reason to skip the man and hold out for what we can hope is a better week for movies next week
