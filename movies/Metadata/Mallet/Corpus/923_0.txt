obviously forgotten today and maybe that's a problem br br michael crichton dealt in practical science fiction how a potential technology could really cause problems in the here and now this movie hit on a few of them some of which have come to pass br br his premise is that computers could be used to simulate characters already has happened and that they could be used to influence us by using algorithms to calculate our optimum responses again probably happening now even if we don't know about it br br the plot is that a plastic surgeon is asked to alter four women into perfect specimens but three of them are killed after wards they never really explain why in trying to protect the last whom he develops a personal bond with he uncovers a plot to use computer generated images wow and now they are real to manipulate our responses br br a note on nudity we have susan dey of partridge family fame going topless in a couple of scenes we'd never see that now if we are lucky we might see a name actress have her head cgi'd ironic onto a body double but usually the mpaa would go completely nuts and give the film an r or nc-17 rating br br some things are dated such as tape-reading computers and big hair on the women so 1980's but the film's concepts hold up pretty well
