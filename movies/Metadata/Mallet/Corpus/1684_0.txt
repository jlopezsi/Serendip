what's not to like astaire-rogers dancing to i don't dance don't ask me ocean liners crossing the atlantic trains racing across northern france jazz bands rehearsing in paris clubs stupendous art deco sets a couturier's elegant salon serenading to balalaikas stunning models privately displaying satin gowns russian princes smoke gets in your eyes sung by the beautiful irene dunne an elegant old russian restaurant with its frescoes fashion show that incorporates astaire and rogers dancing irene dunne's warmth a witty script a broadway smash hit brought to the screen geez what a movie it is only recently that i've begun to enjoy musicals the ones i like are the light ones not the ones incorporating social issues which i feel musicals are ill-equipped to handle br br but a light musical comedy with exquisite dancing charming leads swank clothes elegant sets witty dialogue wow and this is definitely such a musical absolutely charming br br the four leads are wonderfully cast irene dunne reminds me of greer garson in having a certain soulfulness combined with innate gentility and enormous warmth dunne also happens to have had a world-class operatic singing voice that in later movies as operettas ceased to be appealing was seldom heard there is something so very vulnerable about a wounded irene dunne character and she is wonderful in this part br br randolph scott has a big clean very handsome american quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part one in which his character is candid straightforward easily swayed by others who are sophisticated but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken br br fred astaire's subordinate comic supporting role is suited well by the enormous difference in size between himself and scott and obviously his dancing and his easy way with humorous lines is just wonderful br br the 24 year old ginger rogers may be the biggest revelation to me it's not just that she can dance astonishingly well that she is wonderful and wonderfully funny with accents that she can sing songs equally comically or romantically and with great gestures that she is very very funny whip-smart with dialogue but she perfectly suits the job of one hustling for jobs adapting to all circumstances rough and ready and extremely aware at all times br br i think studio heads really saw rogers amazing abilities through the end of world war ii after which she was shamefully abandoned she seldom played the classy woman and we instead find her as a shop girl prisoner on furlough society wannabe entertainer i would like to have seen her play in her career a part in which she more deliberately seductive like barbara stanwyck or joan crawford miriam hopkins or bette davis often did but alas br br you'll like this just relax and feel yourself enthralled
