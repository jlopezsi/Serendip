seen it years ago when it came out to rent and again this year on dvd it is a good film but still in the straight to video bunch of films some fx are really good for such a film and some are not so hot but it has been done to the best of there budget which has not been much any weak parts are made up by a good story one i would like to have seen run another 20 mins or more as it seems to end just as its getting in full swing this is all down to budget mind if the film had more money bit more gritty bit more spent on fx better lighting more depth on story then who knows this could of been a very very good film to push other films such as alien and others but as it is 7 out of 10
