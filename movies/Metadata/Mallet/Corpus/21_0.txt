funny women posey and kudrow star in this popular indie film about office temps in the city and the none-too-bright future they have in this increasingly paranoid and indifferent job field if it can even be considered one br br a lot of cute office shtick in the beginning though nothing you haven't seen done better in clerks and office space but the climatic story of the office-snitch is what killed it for me completely clich and predictable if you don't know who it is the moment the drama starts you have seen very few movies in your day and the character herself no i won't spoil is a tried and true trite stereotype that is more plot device than any character at all br br still both an amusing and somber look at this joke of a job opportunity that awaits many a young woman the cast is very good i wish the story would have been better written i disagree with the critics party girl was a much better showcase for parker posey that film had me laughing from start to finish and without rolling clich√©s in the plot
