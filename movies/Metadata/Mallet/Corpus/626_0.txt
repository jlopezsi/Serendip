a day with the boys is a very unique and experimental short film my first experience with the film came with the special features of david gordon green's george washington this film was described as being an influence on george washington but it is perhaps best to view the film without thinking about green's work a similarity between the two is apparent but the films are almost nothing alike br br i was surprised at how affected i was by the film given its short running time and lack of dialogue it featured a fresh and original stylistic approach that some may unfortunately misinterpret as an attempt to be overly artsy viewing the film with an open mind is a requirement in order to fully appreciate its message br br possible spoiler this film is perhaps one of the more disturbing films i've ever seen not bloody or gory like most horror films but disturbing nonetheless i was really shocked by how much i continued to think about this film in the days following my first viewing br br on a lighter note why are all of the kids unsupervised and alone at 6 in the morning they should be inside watching cartoons if they are awake at all
