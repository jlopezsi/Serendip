under rated scary yes even creepy i like it i rented the dvd years ago and look to buy it for my collection to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds no less petter weller carried the movie no doubt about it the whiny phsycologically scarred soldier from the nebs was far better tolerated than mr game over man from aliens bill paxton at his unusual worst this movie deserved a better budget but was well made within what they had yes i see the static back drops a far cry from the dynamic cg animated ones we have grown used to in recent films however the outer limits style of cinematogrophy worked well for me okay everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better the david screamer caught me off guard from the beginning i didn't suspect anything until he was shot and the chick classic move the teady bear at the end was uber creepy and begs for a well done sequel with peter weller or else don't even try mark this as one of my favorite unsung movies a must see for the sci-fi afficianado
