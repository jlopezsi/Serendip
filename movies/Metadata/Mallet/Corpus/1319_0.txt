what a wonderful movie showing us many aspects of life in eastern turkey and the oppressing role of the army in a very subtle,ironic way one of the first scenes a band of street musicians are setting up their trade now forbidden by the army in a truck near the local graveyard in outer-turkey an army platoon set on their trail prepares to attack rifles aimed at the back of the truck very slowly the back flap is lifted and we see a young man dressed up as a belly dancer and a band of musicians playing such ironic contrasts work through the whole movie the band leader hears by coincidence the internationale thru the love of his daughter for a young die-hard communist and thinks it is the music to be played for a military audience not having a clue about it's origins however the real tone of the story is rather sad and moving the hard life of the musicians trying to make a living the mother and wife-less home of the band leader who lost both in childbirth and the abrupt end which we cannot elaborate here thanks to spoiler policy every european and us-citizen should go see this movie since it seems to give a realistic picture of turkey even now the army is still in power i do hope this movie will have a wide distribution in turkey proper will it
