o my god is this movie horrible br br that about illustrates what about 90 of this bit of telecinematic roadkill plays like slow-motion camera used normally acts as a kind of exclamation point to an action scene here it's used so much that it becomes and ectoplasmic sludge of periods and ellipses here are some of the things this technique manages not to render in stark dramatic relief br br 1 lots of things exploding br br 2 joanna cassidy screaming br br 3 joanna cassidy's daughter screaming mommyyyy br br 4 joanna cassidy's school bus careening around the desert br br 5 an evil-looking snicker black dodge charger careening around the desert after joanna cassidy's school bus br br 6 more things exploding br br 7 everything in between the above items br br needless to say not a whole lot going on here probably a good 20 minutes of action footage in real time along with a requisite but lame set-up story what our brilliant director has done is take an action sequence and stretch it out enough to fill two hours of precious usa network airtime not pad it out stretch it out literally like a piece of silly putty till you can see right through it i guess the framing storyline qualifies as padding on second thought since it does fill out the allotted time adds some exposition and is absolutely inconsequential enough that it doesn't stick in my memory br br the only thing about the acting that i do distinctly remember is joanna cassidy screaming in realtime on the soundtrack while screaming in slow motion on the screen i remember the scream sounding ridiculous as if the dubbing director was giving her a wedgie or maybe it was a tooth being pulled i doubt she was nominated for any emmys for her heroic effort to get through this movie with a straight face br br the only things besides the slo-mo and the endless explosions i remember about the production are the awesomely retarded customization job on the charger huh huh the grille looks like mad eyes huh huh diabolical dewd and the shot of the cop getting creamed by same at the beginning of the movie actually kind of a neat effect his boot goes flying off his foot br br i don't want to give away the nail-biting denouement but i will give you a hint something explodes and something doesn't start until the last possible second the end burp
