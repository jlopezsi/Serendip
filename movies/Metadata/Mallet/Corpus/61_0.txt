william castle's first excursion into the horror genre is not really scary at all it's a mild murder mystery about several dislikable characters one of them presumably having committed a grizzly crime it gets bogged down midway with some flashback sequences which really don't help the narrative that much the performances are well acted and the film manages to keep a decent level of intrigue and curiosity throughout it's also unusual to see jim backus in a rather unlikable role however being advertised as a horror film it fails to provide enough ample shocks to please in that department and it lacks some of the chills and humorous touches of castle's later work still it's worth a look as the first of the william castle gimmick films
