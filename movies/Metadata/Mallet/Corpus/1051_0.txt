as an old rock&roll road dog who played for years and later went into production and management of younger rock bands i think this movie has a lot to say on many levels br br i'm not going to comment on a review as such but the internet tv view listing i saw when i went to see if it was going to play again said that these kids had gotten good dispite the way the teacher had gone about doing it br br to me it's funny how a little rough language towards the kids says somehow the teaching method was a failure br br without giving away anything about the movie i will say this i remember going to a school as a young child where i was in a talent show i rehearsed for weeks and won after it was over i realized that everyone had won something all 50 kids br br i was placated into thinking that was how life worked then wham the reality of musical life hit me when i went on the road in the real world br br let's face it people as a rule and young people in particular are basic under-achievers sometimes all it takes is a little bit of frustration love to make it all click br br music itself is a passion not a method and rock music even more so than most br br as a parent myself i would suggest this movie to anyone who has a musically inclined child not matter what genre they wish to pursue br br competition is within ones self not against everyone else if the fire of music is in a child it will come out if handled right if not then thats ok also but don't let it just die as a faint ember of creativity fan it into a full flame of artistic expression
