swimmers is an endearing movie you can sympathize with the characters and understand their pain i thought that it would be a regional movie but it really speaks to people everywhere the lighting and sound are amazing i didn't want the movie to end i wanted to follow the family and their story even the dad who definitely had his faults was a person you could relate to i hope that this movie goes worldwide as everyone should see it and enjoy it doug has written a powerful story about love and anguish in a family and how they deal with their emotions i'd like to see a sequel involving the troubled teen
