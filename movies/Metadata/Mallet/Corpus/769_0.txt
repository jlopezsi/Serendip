this is a very entertaining adventure story marred only by a stupid voodoo ending the story grabs you almost from the very start as a young boy son of americans is whisked away from his parents by amazon rain forest natives br br ten years later the kid now being a teenager is discovered by his father who had never stopped searching for him during that search and afterward we are witness to numerous action scenes really nice jungle photography and just a fascinating story br br the cinematography involving story no profanity and just plain good adventure all make this movie an entertaining one just ignore what's put at the end which is insult to anyone of any intelligence but hollywood can't stop giving credence to any indian mythologies and superstitions
