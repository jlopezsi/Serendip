brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister ginger in the first film so to prevent herself from changing into the beast she injects monksblood into her system but after an overdose she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic which now she has become so attached to the syrup and without it the affects of the curse starts to transform within her from the physical to the mental attributes but also on her tail is that of a male werewolf who wants to mate with her and ginger is keeping a tab on her by haunting her mind br br i remember when i picked up ginger snaps i was expecting another mediocre or below-average werewolf flick gosh i was wrong just like dog soldiers it was more then good and added some new life to the whimpering sub-genre and i'm happy to say it worked out again in this monstrous sequel and i was actually digging this one a tad more though that was up until the stalling sequences involving hiding out in a house it would've been great to see more katharine isabelle as ginger too but you can't have it all your own way i guess i wasn't expecting anything incredibly special but it did have big boots to fill and we all know the law of diminishing returns well this sequel keeps far away form that trend and doesn't lean away from the quirky and offbeat nature of its predecessor but it actually enhances it with a very morbid and cold-hearted appeal it's depressing to the bone i but i get kick out of any films that create this sort of tone though what made the original rejuvenating was that it had warm and natural relationships between the characters especially between bridget and ginger but also with the parents because of the sequel's depressing vibe it does lack the heartache of the horrifying matter that drove the sisters even closer in the first film also it sorely does miss the characteristic interactions between the sisters although saying that they do share some screen time here but only in small doses meaning far less impact br br the plot is an absorbing one which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade but also adding another dimension to the tale just like in the first film and like many reviewers have painted it's a metaphor for adolescent life from angst drugs and sex but this cocktail is mixed with a refreshing twist involving the werewolf mythology introducing the metaphor part of all of this the snappy script holds up well and the story moves along pretty quickly with enough excitement initiated and the twists are far from easy to detect no way is this story's structure predictable the actual ending was kind of clever but felt odd and left me feeling a little unsatisfied the editing was swiftly sharp and potent to the pacing it also recaptures the slickly handled production of that of the original but it looks like it had more to work with here that's especially because the special effects and werewolf designs were vastly better this time around and the attacks were more callous and bloodier the isolated setting was made to great use with its cold wintry backdrop and gloomy awe the action might have up the ante in this sequel but so did the soundtrack by igniting itself with the gothic and haunting tunes that made the original great the upbeat tempo of the soundtrack bounds the mood the spectral sound effects also worked its way into the picture and it was hard to shut out its thumping vibration throughout the out-and-out stylistic camera-work sinuously develops some inventive shots the direction by brett sullivan is above par and he hones down his skills with preciseness but adding such tautness and tension to the picture the performances were magnificent emily perkins comes out of the shadow of katharine isabelle here and she made the most of it by turning in a convincing performance tatiana maslany as ghost one of the kids in the clinic provides on the humour side of things and eric johnson is perfectly scummy as one of the workers at the clinic katharine isabelle makes some small but yet effective glimpses and adds in with some voice-overs this production most definitely went one step bigger br br after two worthy werewolf films i wonder if the film makers can repeat this winning formula in their third flick of the series ginger snaps back the beginning 2004 or will it come crashing back to earth with a thud the sequel is very much on par with the original and definitely well worth the look actually i would say it's a must-see if you seen the original
