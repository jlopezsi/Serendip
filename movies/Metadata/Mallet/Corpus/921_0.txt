today's audiences are a bit spoiled and jaded this was a great movie for it's time yes i still have a copy of it on beta format it is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation at some point real actors will no longer be needed hmmmmmm there is also a looker gun that sends out a light pulse that causes the victim to freeze and loose chunks of time sounds a little familiar anyone seen mib there is the look into the plastic surgery and the need to look perfect that's where the title comes in albert finney and susan dey make an unlikely pairing in this futuristic sci-fi drama anyway this is worth checking out so grab a tab soda relax and try to find a copy of this movie
