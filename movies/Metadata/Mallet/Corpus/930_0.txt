i had seen potter's the singing detective before viewing this no not the damn robert downey jr version but the superb british tv 6-parter so i knew i could expect interesting characters bizarre events and an unpredictable plot br br loyc has a terrific cast first and foremost which was essential as so often to be able to pull off this kind of script ewan mcgregor in his very much younger days presents the best performance of his career alongside trainspotting in a way it's a pity that he showed so much promise early on but although always very likable he was sub-par in many movies that followed the guy that plays the neurotic stuttering welshmen is simply brilliant i enjoyed that character very much nearly every scene with him was a hilarious joy the actor who plays the primitive daft corporal is very good too the middle-aged army guys were played by familiar faces very good actors and last but not least we have louise germaine here playing the femme fatale she was a perfect choice her innocent face matched her character's shallowness and stupidity very well plus a very sexy woman a couple of nude scenes with her were not a drawback i wonder why i've barely seen her anywhere apart from this tv series br br the musical sequences may appear strange at first but once one gets accustomed to them they actually give us a nice distraction from some of the tension that goes on the songs are to the most part quite pleasant 50s oldies so no harm done no madonna or aerosmith thank god nor would have i expected that kind of crap of course if you want something genuine original unpredictable but not in an idiotic saw kind of way very well-acted and a little seedy even look no further
