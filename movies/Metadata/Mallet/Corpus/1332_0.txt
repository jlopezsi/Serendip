it's funny that a critic from the new york times could know so little about film i will not say much except this is one of the most simple most beautiful stories made into cinema there is absolutely no artifice no tricks and every detail is pure and genuine tony uses faces kurasawa could've killed for you ain't seen nothing if you ain't seen this the music artists like gritos de guerra la caita sheik al tuni seemingly unavailable on record but better than anything i've heard seems to capture at once the joy and sorrow bound up in human life likewise the players most not actors in fact the music is so integrated into the lives of the characters in the end there is no division for reviewers of respected periodicals we would explain this is what is called thematic so much for the standards of education in journalism even reviewers who really liked this movie did not fully understand this like most really great art it is ahead of the curve i suppose it should be possible to find a film as beautiful as this as simple and captivating but none come to mind skip vengo and your life will certainly be less rich
