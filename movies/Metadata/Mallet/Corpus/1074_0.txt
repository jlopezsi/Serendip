problem 1 the chief problem with this film is its ridiculous screenplay the film can't decide if it wants to be a mindless action flick or a character-driven sci-fi drama so what you get is an alien invasion story where all the leads get infected by the aliens but are somehow saved by their friends while scores of infected extras get mowed down by machine-gun fire if a lead character is infected their buddies come up with all sorts of ways to peel the alien critter off but if farmer joe comes running at them with a lug wrench no one hesitates to pump him full of holes br br problem 2 richard belzer is in this movie and he is given not a single funny line spoiler when his character ices himself i felt like it was richard belzer's way of saying this flick stinks i'm outta here problem 3 the final clich helicopter action sequence it seemed like it they filmed it for another movie or something and just tagged it onto the end of this one
