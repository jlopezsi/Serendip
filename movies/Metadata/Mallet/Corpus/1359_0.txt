when i rented this movie i didn't have too high expectations to what it was going to be like but even so i must admit i was disappointed i wanted to watch this movie part because i enjoyed the easy going humor in clueless and part because i like alicia silverstone as a young actress but neither of these two reasons were enough to make me like excess baggage at all the movie lacks a good plot and is rather boring after a while all though silverstone put up a half decent performance benicio del toro didn't get his role together and stood out like a sore thumb a good tip don't waste your money or your time on this boring and dumb movie
