final fantasy 8 is a superb game this isn't a where you can just shoot em up blast em down and be done with it this is a deeply involved game with a nice plot that you mustn't view as a movie picture it instead as a novel a novel that you have to sit down appreciate the plot and the characters as you watch the plot develop over its grand four-disc length br br i'm not going into the plot as you can just read the quotes above to get your details there i will say it has an amazing soundtrack and great graphics and some nice dialog as well br br if you balk at the fact that it becomes a little unbelievable at times remember that fan-tasy equals fun-tasy and then be on your way br br oh and if you can get it for playstation not pc
