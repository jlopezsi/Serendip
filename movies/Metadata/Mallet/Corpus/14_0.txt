clockwatchers surprised me in many ways at first i thought was just going to be a quirky comedy about resentful temps i was wrong there were many things in this satire that came unexpected i was surprised with it's meticulousness every scene looks like it was arranged to resemble an office to the slightest details you can strongly feel that dry and dead air and the way everything seems to move without any change in a monotonous pattern that will slowly but surely kill you're personal energy i never knew that an office could feel so oppressive and this film portrays it was successful accuracy another thing that surprised me was the unexpected seriousness i actually found myself thinking about some of the character's observations on careers and goals how sometimes we can totally lose our identity when all we try to do is to please others and maintain a decent salary when clockwatchers was over i actually found myself depressed and menaced by the possibility that my life could turn out like the characters but bleak elements aside this was also a pretty funny film as well parker posey delivers a juicy performance her pessimism never ceases to entertain the other actresses are also good and most of the scenes they share together are enjoyable to watch the only thing that could of used some fixing was the film's last half hour it dragged on with the whole new girl plotline and the final conclusion was too vague to satisfy but still clockwatcher is a good film a unique blend of snappy humour and depressing accuracy that usually succeeds
