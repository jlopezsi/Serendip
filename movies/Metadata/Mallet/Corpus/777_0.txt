of all the movies that you could watch if you choose to watch this movie i should say that your very unfortunate the story is crap the acting nowhere near tolerable and the music not something we'd expect from a.r rehman but its not fair to judge a r rehman with this movie because the music of a movie is to an extent influenced by the story and acting i wonder how someone like ajith can ever be called an actor his dialogue delivery is pathetic and its better i don't mention his facial expressions you'd do yourself a favour by not watching this movie or rather watch it and educate others on how these kinda movies humiliate the once-enchanting tamil film industry also i beg the filmmakers not to cast people who are stone heads when it comes to dancing in roles that are supposed to highlight it for crying out loud ajith can't even dance to those funny dappankuthu songs how can one tolerate him dancing bharathanatyam the thought of him donning the role of a classical dancer would make good dancers of yesteryears turn in their graves and watch out for the scenes where ajith is supposed to be projecting an effeminate side its official he's the worst(or is there a worser term for that thing that can happen to tamil cinema
