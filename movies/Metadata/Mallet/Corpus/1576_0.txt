i disagree with both sentiments stated here i think this was simply a dramatization about the evils of totalitarianism from a 1960-ish perspective all the actions of that government are evil including outlawing god i'm agnostic but i don't see anything like this happening bush or obama the 1963 supreme court case overturned laws that made prayer in public schools compulsory putting those laws back in place would move the country more toward the regime in the episode just from the other side the side that's not in office is always afraid during bush meridith's character represents liberals during obama he is the conservatives but only in their own minds
