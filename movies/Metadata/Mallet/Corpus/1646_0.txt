so i travel from sweden to copenhagen to see a movie paying about 15 bucks for the trip and another 10 for the movie 25 bucks for a movie was it worth it br br damn right it was this is nicholas winding refn´s second feature and after his masterful debut pusher i really had my hopes up and boy was it good br br the tempo is a little slower than pusher but it really suits the movie it´s got great dialogue that kinda reminded me of clerks in some places especially the scenes in the videostore the theme of the movie in my mind is about men and our problems with talking to each other and to women sure there are scenes with really disturbing and realistic violence but i feel it has more in common with john cassavettes than abel ferrara and martin scorsese that i think were refn inspirations for pusher br br the actors are brilliant all around especially mads mikkelsen who does a fantastic performance as a filmgeek with major problems when it comes to talking and being around girls and kim bodnia gives a really introspective performance that proves his status as one of europe´s if not the whole worlds best actors br br all in all a very powerful and intense movie that is a must see
