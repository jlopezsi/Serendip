right now there's a dvd out with a few of the stories edited into movies but i wanted to see it in its original form i had one video as a kid and the rest of the series i've only seen through low-quality internet videos br br it's interesting to see the direction the show took immediately after the original movies and before episodes 1-3 were thought of the character designs are fun and even if they're sometimes clich or annoying they're bearable overall br br the writing style is campy for sure but the show's a great piece of nostalgia and i'd gladly shell out the money for a good-quality set of the original episodes
