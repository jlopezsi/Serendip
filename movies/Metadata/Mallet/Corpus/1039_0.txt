bon jour i am attending the cannes marche du film and just saw this it is really good it is much better than the jack black movie which i could not stand although i must admit that jack black as paul green was perfect casting br br if you have any recollection of 80s hard rock i think you'd like this these kids do a great job with billy idol alice cooper black sabbath and zappa br br i am a fan of documentaries and enjoyed rock school i didn't think it was as good as dogtown z boys which i loved but if you enjoyed spellbound you will probably enjoy rock school br br i hope it gets picked up for wide distribution
