i got this movie because i wanted to see shannen doherty in a different element from 90210 and charmed to determine if she could really act the answer is no she displayed absolutely no emotional range in the character hardly any visible change from a constant dead-pan expression and no deviation from a monotone delivery of dialogue or narration the one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend but no an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult so instead we get nothing i mean zero there are numerous actors who get bottled into their tv persona but eventually break free to prove they are talented i really was hoping shannen doherty would be enjoyable to watch she wasn't this movie stunk
