hellgate starts late one night in a isolated log cabin where three friends chuck even j klisser bobby joanne ward pam petrea curran are telling scary urban legend stories to each other bobby starts hers she tells a tale set in the 50's about a nearby public attraction the authentic replica ghost town of hellgate owned by lucas carlyle carel trichardt a gang of bikers known as the strangers kidnap kill his daughter josie abigail wolcott lucas is obviously devastated soon after a guy named jonas victor melleney is attacked by a bat in a mine which he kills he then notices a strange blue crystal which shoots a blue laser-beam at the bat which returns to life jonas tells lucas who decides to use the crystal to bring his daughter back to life who then lures unsuspecting travellers to hellgate for reasons i don't really know so lucas can kill them for reasons that are never satisfactorily explained as bobby tells the somewhat lame story they have a fourth friend named matt ron pilillo on his way to join them however while driving he stops to offer a pretty young woman a lift home br br directed by william a levey who also appears in the film as the severed head in the fridge i though hellgate was crap the script by michael o'rourke is really silly lame while it tries to be different the whole thing is so absurd that it falls flat on it's face it moves along at a fair pace but doesn't really interest grip or entertain things are never explained properly it doesn't seem to have any rules why does the crystal mutate somethings make them explode what the hell is this crystal why does it have magical powers why does it re-animate josie perfectly without any side effects why does it melt jonas why does lucas kill everyone he has his daughter back so what does he get out of it why do everyone else who are killed come back as zombies is it the crystal again if so why are they rotten not perfect the climax is lame underwhelming to say the least lets hope the suggested sequel never materialises this is pretty awful stuff from start to finish with horrible character's that are dumb unlikable deserve everything that comes to them br br director levey messes everything up there is no style tension atmosphere or scares the best he can muster is blue neon lighting lots of fake fog swirling around the special effects are pretty cheap looking tacky that mutant goldfish for instance the gore is tame an axe in the head a knife in a leg a decapitation someone face melting a few zombies that don't do anything there's a bit of nudity sex but not enough to save it br br technically hellgate is pretty poor it was filmed in south africa apparently not that you'd notice the entire production is cheap the ghost town itself is one street the special effects are unimpressive especially that laser beam effect as a whole no-one seemed to put much effort in it the acting is predictably bad trichardt as the villain has some silly plates on his face for some reason never says anything during the film br br hellgate is a really bad 80's horror film that has little to recommend it it's different that's the only positive thing i can say about it a stupid mess of a film one to avoid
