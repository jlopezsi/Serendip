the emerald forest is a racist oversimplification of a more complex issue the portrayal of native americans is a joke and perpetuates stereotype after stereotype of native innocence vs western intelligence the portrayal of the fierce people as cannibalistic baboons is ridiculous and highly offensive especially under the claim that the film is based on true events equally as unfortunate is the display of the invisible people as a tribe of purity and peace their beautiful innocence makes them the pathetic victim of western expansion obviously this movie addresses an important topic but their are better ways to make the argument against deforestation and genocide this movie is best used as a metaphor for understanding of the story of adam and eve and christian morality outrageously bad acting to top it off it's good for a laugh
