this movie has everything frocks dancing songs i love those russian songs by kern and irene dunne really can sing she can act too see the scene where professionalism forces her to be polite to john's fianc fred and ginger's dancing is transcendent and one of the great works of art of western civilisation for the past 3,000 years and fred plays the piano too and is very funny he sweeps ginger off her feet in the last scene but when she proposes to him he's inarticulate but he says yes of course and who wrote his amusing descriptions of the frocks could it have been kern's old broadway partner pelham grenville wodehouse the only flaw is a running gag about a band member with a falsetto voice who tries to sound butch how the groundlings must have laughed
