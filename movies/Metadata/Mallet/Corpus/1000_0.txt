i have to say when a name like zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover i was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku but what i got instead was a comedy so it wasn't quite was i was expecting but i really liked it anyway the best scene ever was the main cop dude pulling those kids over and pulling a bad lieutenant on them i was laughing my ass off i mean the cops were just so bad and when i say bad i mean the shield vic macky bad but unlike that show i was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope br br felissa rose man oh man what can you say about that hottie she was great and put those other actresses to shame she should work more often i also really liked the fight scene outside of the building that was done really well lots of fighting and people getting their heads banged up fun last but not least joe estevez and william smith were great as the well i wasn't sure what they were but they seemed to be having fun and throwing out lines i mean some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick but who cares when you're laughing so hard all in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread but i wasn't expecting that it was a troma flick so i figured it would totally suck it's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking br br rent it if you want to get stoned on a friday night and laugh with your buddies don't rent it if you are an uptight weenie or want a zombie movie with lots of flesh eating br br p.s uwe boil was a nice touch
