why do some people call this television series a disgrace to the looney tunes i think this show is great and it is worth watching br br other than that some comments on this site state that lola bunny should not be in the show as she was introduced in the movie space jam some comments also state that granny should be younger when the looney tunes were toddlers br br but in my opinion we should not think about these issues instead we should consider if the plot and the quality of the show are good or not br br other than that i feel this show educational and taught young children about caring and sharing br br i had watched some episodes of the show well my opinion is this it was a great and meaningful show i am willing to use the 30 minutes of my time to watch this show br br such as a good show should not be criticized br br my rating 70/100
