another highly entertaining sci-fi film based on a philip k dick short story which i have subsequently read and i agree with other reviewers that the movie is true to the story for the most part br br have yet to view a movie based on a dick story that wasn't enjoyable e.g blade runner minority report if you liked either of those movies,you will enjoy this movie for its intelligent entertainment br br weller's character hendricksson is fairly straight forward as a disenchanted commander believing that his command has been abandoned and that their battles on this outpost planet have been made irrelevant by the higher authorities consequently hendricksson sets out to bring a truce proposal to the enemy forces br br but technology gone awry rears its ugly head in the form of self-manufacturing killing devices known as the screamers named for their high pitched sound just before they slice and dice humans
