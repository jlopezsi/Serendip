i found this movie and movie number six wish maker jirachi way different than the other pokemon movies they were kind of more mature anyway this movie was really good and i just watched it today on kidswb i think what really made this a good movie was the fact that it had featured pokemon from outer space which was interesting and brings a whole new world to pokemon i recommend this movie because its feature length it has two really strong pokemon in it one secret pokemon that has something to do with snorlax and its a lot of fun to watch the only faulty thing i didn't like about it was that it lacked good popular music like the other four before pokemon jirachi wish maker i think good rock songs would have made it earn the true title as a pokemon movie
