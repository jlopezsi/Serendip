set during the spanish inquisition this take on the poe story features grand inquisitor torquemada lance henriksen in a marvelously intense performance engaging in various acts of torture to get citizens to confess to witchcraft he targets young baker antonio jonathan fuller and his wife maria the amazingly alluring rona de ricci who looks great in and out of clothes only to find himself lusting after her he then proceeds to torture her concluding that his lust can only be the result of her bewitching him br br putting aside anachronisms such as the lack of accents and the rather modern way much of the dialog is delivered this is a solid effort from veteran genre director gordon it looks fantastic with impressive sets and costumes in his ever enjoyable fashion gordon spices it up with plenty of violence and his great touch for black humor granted the broader comedy relief courtesy of torquemadas clownish associates played amusingly by jeffrey combs stephen lee and william j norris i could have done without but overall the film is commendably as intense as henriksens central performance it's very striking involving de ricci not only is very attractive she really gets to the heart of her impassioned character and lavish with a typically fine music score by richard band br br the strong supporting cast contributes equally vivid turns frances bay tom towles mark margolis are all excellent as well gordons actress wife carolyn turns up and as usual there's a graphic demise in store for her oliver reed pops up about halfway through the movie in a nice cameo as a cardinal br br it's a great full moon production and a film that any fan of gordons re-animator or from beyond ought to see br br 8/10
