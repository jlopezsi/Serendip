ginger snaps 2 unleashed 1/2 actors emily perkins tatiana maslany eric johnson writer megan martin director brett sullivan br br the second part of the ginger snaps trilogy picks up after the first one bridgitte has infected herself with ginger's blood who has turned into a werewolf in order to keep herself from becoming like her sister she must inject herself daily with monkshood after barely escaping a werewolf that has found her she awakes in a clinic that treats all things including drug addiction with her drugs taken away bridgitte can't escape what she is becoming br br i loved the 1st movie and i found the second one to be a worthwhile sequel while the first one simmered with satire on female hormones and puberty unleashed is a straight horror film it's too bad we don't see much of ginger in this one but she does turn up as a ghost who warns bridgitte that another one waits for her bridgitte is a lot more confident and a lot hotter than the first one but although this is her story the one character that steals the show is a young girl at the hospital named ghost bridgitte befriends this girl because she can help get her monkshood and i'm sure she feels a little bad that all the other patients make fun of her there is a twist at the end of this movie that i was not expecting but on my second viewing of it i don't know how i could have missed it all the warning signs were shown in the first thirty minutes br br if you haven't seen the first one you could just watch this one alone it has a good enough story to keep you interested it's not as fulfilling as the original but it's a nice desert
