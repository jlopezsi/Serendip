the only reason this film exist at all is that dorothy stratten is in it autumn born has all the finesse of a 70's porn film but without the sex scenes although i did like the story an uncle who have his niece kidnapped to brainwash her into signing her fortunes over to him it is a interesting story but not fully realized by the writer and by the director of this movie br br in autumn born you get to see plenty of dorothy stratten than any other films that she is in you get to hear her speak with her canadian accent(she does have a very lovely voice you get to heard her say eh couple of times at the start of the film you get to see dorothy in varies states of undress either by another or by herself a lot what i like about this movie is that you get to see the budding of her acting talent now i have seen more than my shares of bad acting in low budget movies but dorothy's acting although rough around the edges still have more room to grow that is if she was to allow to develop her skill it is really a shame that all we get to see of dorothy stratten as an actress is in low rent movies like this one
