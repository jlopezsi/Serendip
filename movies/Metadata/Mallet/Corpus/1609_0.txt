it is 1850's new orleans and julie marsten davis a head-strong young woman who doesn't find it the least improper to be late for her own engagement party because she feels like riding her horse instead is getting married to preston dillard fonda unfortunately preston isn't at the party because he is hammering out business at his family's bank when they are married he and julie will be moving north an almost sacrilegious action during this time buck cantrell george brent is julie's former beau who remains a family friend and still defends julie's honor one day when preston doesn't drop everything to attend a dress fitting for julie that he had originally promised to attend she defiantly insists that she purchase a red dress breaking the white dress only tradition for the ball they were attending despite the protestations of everyone she knows including preston she wears the dress to the ball causing her to be ostracized and the official break up of her engagement to preston when he realizes that he cannot deal with her headstrong attitude he leaves for the north without her and comes back a year later with a surprise and sees that yellow fever has gripped new orleans a peril that threatens everyone br br jezebel is a tale of defiance love and redemption davis plays her role so well that it is hard to determine whether you want to support her or marginalize her as a spoiled brat i think that even when the film was made 1938 the lines were still blurred as to how many freedoms and how much free-thinking should be afforded to women it is easy for me to say that julie's red dress was much ado about nothing but then again this is the millennium when nothing is overtly shocking anymore the mere fact that i thought so much about a classic film which generally has throwaway plots is a true testament to davis performance and the writing under william wyler's direction jezebel is essentially gone with the wind without the budget or the color and was made the year before that film was released most of the characters are fairly throwaway but the subject is julie and her development is amazing and very believable despite the melodramatic genre this is a film that most classic film lovers have seen i'm sure i am apparently a late bloomer in regard to this film but if you are one and you haven't seen it or are a bette davis fan see this movie most of her late 30's to 1950 films are so spectacular just because of her performance if the rest is good it's gravy and this is one of her best known performances 7/10 shelly
