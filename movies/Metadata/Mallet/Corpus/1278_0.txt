thanks mercutio-8 for the information that it was based on a play that helped me to understand that there might have been something to it once but now there is almost no plot at all just a couple of scenes with heavy bantering sometimes somewhat funny and some very unstructured criticism of the mccarthy era br br there has to be more to be made out of this concept comedy under the strain of self-imposed censorship during mccarthyism rivalry and yet comradeship between writers the actual process of brainstorming the early tv-market economy demands from media barons vs artistic freedom i think there was an ambition to show these different themes although the director accomplished none of the above br br no shadow should fall on the actors though they're all top of the line but when they get such a lousy script to work with what can they do
