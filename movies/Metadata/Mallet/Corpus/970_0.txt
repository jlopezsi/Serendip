take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda blend together for about ninety-three minutes and the result is shooting fish an amiable entertaining comedy directed by stefan schwartz it's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean dylan dan futterman in america jez stuart townsend in england and who by the time they had reached the age of consent had each been endowed with a particular talent dylan has the gift of gab jez is a technical wizard dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people however and to stay healthy read alive he flees to england where he meets jez and it's a friendship/partnership born in scam/scheme heaven if there's a way to make a fast buck they know it from selling bogus computers to selling insulation for homes that's never installed to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike if there's a nickel in it they're in br br then one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams georgie kate beckinsale is beautiful smart and has a cause she's trying to fund so she needs the job but from day one she's on to what dylan and jez are trying to pull she stays on board however when dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day robin hoods that the money they're raising is going to orphans what he doesn't tell her is that the orphans he's referring to is them and dylan is a born salesman not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer and the three of them become a real team br br schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable but it is entertaining it's exactly what it promises to be a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time it's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved there are a couple of scenes in fact that are downright hilarious and schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along which when you add it all up makes for a satisfying enjoyable experience br br futterman has a winning personality and a resonant mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet because if you do chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge he's a likable heel convincingly brought to life by futterman who is probably best known for his role of vincent gray in the judging amy tv series it's a good performance and one of the strengths of the film br br as jez townsend does a fine job too and though he's overshadowed a bit by dylan intentionally the flashier of the two jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience after all this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust and it's interesting to compare townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire lestat in the more recent queen of the damned he's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with futterman and along with beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists br br the one who draws the attention however is the lovely and charismatic kate beckinsale who is beguiling in the role of georgie she makes her character accessible and plays her with a savvy rather than naive sensibility and it's a portrayal that works well most importantly she makes georgie real with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her she's the most grounded of the trio and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility this may not be the stuff oscars are made of but it's an enjoyable engaging performance that will win you over without question br br the supporting cast includes rowena cooper jez's teacher myles anderson jez aged 8 jacob macoby dylan aged 8 jane lapotaire dylan's headmistress tom chadbon mr greenaway phyllis logan mrs ross peter mcnamara geoff arabella weir mrs stratton-luce nickolas grace mr stratton-luce and claire cox floss an easy-going comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes shooting fish is a solid feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment and in the final analysis that's not such a bad deal and it's all a part of the magic of the movies i rate this one 7/10
