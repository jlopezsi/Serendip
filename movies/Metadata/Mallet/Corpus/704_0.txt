this film starts out good and pretty much stays that way reaching its high point with the oedipus joke after that it's straight down it just loses appeal to fast and it especially does so after the first wedding then there are some shoot outs and a betrayal subplot and somehow the comedy gets lost and you just have a mafia movie that is not really that good also i found the performance of lisa kudrow too friends like and i though that deniro could not cry that convincingly but that latter doesn't really matter to me that much for this is a comedy up until the oedipus joke i probably would have given this one an 8 but now seeing the whole film its this br br a verrrrrry small like 6,5 7 out of 10
