this was much better than what i expected.since it had such poor reviews,i rented the video only to watch my new favorite actor benicio del toro i was actually pleasantly surprised at how good he was in a romantic comedy.he should do these more often he has proved himself in serious roles already but i think he can be a very refreshing lead in romantic roles haven't we seen enough hugh grant movies yet i wont go into details about the plot,which had an interesting start but looked like it wasn't sure where it was headed at the end.then again a movie starring alicia silverstone can't be expected to be so plot-conscious if you're a fan of benicio you'll enjoy his unique debonaire charm in this movie.for once he doesn't look that intense or sad and we can really feel the tenderness behind his half-smile i might not be such an objective viewer but this movie is such a nice distraction from the julia roberts sandra bullock romantic comedies
