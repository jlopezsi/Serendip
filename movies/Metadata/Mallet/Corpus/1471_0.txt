all the comments about this film are favorable except for mr neil doyle's i wonder what grumpy pill he took when he watched this or maybe he just isn't a romantic guy not one person said his review was helpful br br this film is well-acted scripted and an interesting premise the music is fabulous and the setting great like another reviewer said joan fontaine's facial expressions say as much or more than the words she was given to speak she is one excellent actress and joseph cotten is a veteran actor who once again turns in a fabulous performance br br i unconditionally recommend this movie to all classic movie lovers to fans of joan fontaine and/or joseph cotten and to all romantics everywhere
