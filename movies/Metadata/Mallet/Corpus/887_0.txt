a man's relentless drive toward self-destruction is the tenor plot in this film but the surrounding study of human nature and of what can be the ultimate values in life fill out the canvas squarcio the hero has through good fortune escaped detection long enough to establish a comfortable life for his family and loving wife other fishermen who have reason enough to detest him consistently show him compassion their basic good natures prevailing squarcio though like a sturm und drang character relentlessly pursues a path his logic and wife and children tell him he should abandon he is offered other choices he sees other charismatic characters uselessly die yet his actions are emotionally driven br br at mid-film the local coast guard commander chooses to retire to quit service before having to witness the death or imprisonment of his childhood friend i the viewer felt likewise very much like abandoning the theater before the inevitable yet i stayed on hoping for some early hint of a happy end to come br br but for me the most memorable moments in this film were certain sea scenes set to challenge the most beautiful and intriguing of any painting of the old venetian school sepia sails emerald seas white and green hulls and old fortresses in the background all looking a bit unreal like a child's playthings almost too perfect too harmonic squarcio of course wasn't part of such scenes he was off on his own individualist but misguided path
