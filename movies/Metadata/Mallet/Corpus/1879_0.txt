there are two ways you can watch this alone or with people if you watch it alone you are a)comatose b)about to i know this phrase is used a lot but now it's an understatement this is the worst movie ever ever ever ever everything from the opening credits listing the make-up and stunt people before the writer and not the director to the final shot when richard nixon and allan ginsberg form an unlikely duo in a last-ditch attempt to completely ruin sense the ultimate post-modernist statement not only the complete deconstruction of logic and convention but also breaking every rule of satire surrealism and overproduction it is appealing on absolutely no level if you watch it with people you become punchdrunk immediately as you try to rationalize why a guy who was strangled is covered in blood and why a girl with her wrists gashed has only lost about a teaspoon you plural will all laugh not at the movie but at how any attempt to understand any part of the movie hurts every part of your brain it is post-to the seventh-degree-modernism like nothing you ever have seen or will see it goes so far beyond any convention in any medium that it will likely take years to reproduce something so astounding it is a must see simply because i can't thing of any reason why this was made or why anything in the future will be so it transcends good and bad truly in a class of its own see it the way you think will be forever changed
