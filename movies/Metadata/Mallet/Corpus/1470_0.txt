i've been a joan fan for a while now so when i saw the laser disc for this movie i got it right away br br i was definitely not disappointed br br this movie has got a great story that could actually happen in real life br br joan gives a great performance as usual of course joseph is also perfect as the man she falls in love with at the same time saving her life br br a great movie to watch if you like romance and a beautiful setting for a movie italy
