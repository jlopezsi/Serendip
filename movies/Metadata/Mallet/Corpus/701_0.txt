analyze this is a wickedly funny tale of where a tough foul-mouthed new york mob boss paul vitti robert de niro suddenly loses his mind and is persuaded by jelly joe viterelli one of his two bodyguards to go see a shrink a few weeks before a big meeting at first vitti doesn't like the idea but goes ahead the first time that vitti and ben sobel billy crystal a calm shrink meet face to face is okay but the events that happen after that are serious and down-right funny the dialogue that crystal and de niro are well-written and well-acted lisa kudrow joe viterelli and chazz palminterri also give very solid supporting performances in this movie kyle sahiby is good as sobel's son who has fun nitpicking sobel harold ramis has made some good films in the past caddyshack and his careful direction here pays off br br the best scene of the movie is the opening scene is masterfully written to perfection and it's just hilarous one good example is vitti's dad and a friend of his hijack a farmer who's on his john deere tractor and drive through the corn field overall de niro and crystal make a great comedy team
