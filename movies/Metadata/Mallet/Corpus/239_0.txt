this movie was a well filmed work of art based on a japanese novel it was a hit in the korean box office there were some funny moments but not that many i have to say this movie reminded me of madeleine however this romance movie was quite unusual it wasn't boring and yet there was no solid resolution the story line was very interesting and original the acting was okay and the ost was great if you are a fan of korean drama you'll probably enjoy this little flick odd film
