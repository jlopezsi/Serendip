since the first time i saw this wonderful film on late-night tv maybe 30 years ago it has been my sentimental favorite every time i've seen it since once a year on average it's made me weep not many films ever have this effect on me even once i simply don't understand why it isn't better known not to mention better regarded the touching story fine direction good score and superb acting add up to a great experience for me the performances by claudette colbert and orson welles are their most effective hers ranks with her work in three came home and since you went away while his is even finer than in the stranger anyone who loves a good old-fashioned love story sob story multi-generational saga of the type hollywood used to make so well should give this one a try
