version eastern eye's r4 dvd release japanese english subtitles br br i probably would not have been able to see lady snowblood had it not been for quentin tarantino and kill bill i've seen the lone wolf and cub movies several times on sbs and i think they're great but i probably would not have been able to find a copy of lady snowblood without the popularity of kill bill luckily for me i still managed to see lady snowblood before kill bill i don't want to sound smug but i'm probably one of the few people my age who can say that and seeing lady snowblood before kill bill is a lot better than seeing kill bill and then expecting lady snowblood to be exactly like kill bill br br in the 3rd year of meiji japan 1871 or thereabouts i think a family is attacked by bandits the father and child are killed the mother sayo miyoko akaza taken by one of the evil-doers as a slave when sayo is imprisoned and unable to exact her vengeance she bears another child yuki meiko kaji to carry on where sayo yuki is born for vengeance and that may be all she ever knows br br normally i comment on revenge stories and say wow awesome vengeance however in this case i've been studying this period of japanese history for a university course and i can appreciate this as more than just a tale of vengeance lady snowblood is a tragedy a story about sweeping social upheaval and the people caught up in change of course i can't resist pointing out the fact that this is also an awesome revenge story lady snowblood is an awesome revenge story br br despite the high amount of fake blood kill bill and lone wolf and cub are better action movies than lady snowblood meiko kaji's yuki is fearsome and she fights well but the over-the-top fights of kill bill and lone wolf and cub are better the camera is shaky at times and the action is often hard to distinguish but any fan of kill bill or the classic samurai movies should still be able to appreciate it br br lady snowblood stands as one of the best classic samurai movies around the remake princess blade doesn't hold a candle to this nor does the similar etsuko shihomi film dragon princess i even think fans of the recent azumi should check out lady snowblood those who haven't seen kill bill should see this first and then kill bill after lady snowblood isn't just a revenge story but its still a a damn good revenge story 9/10
