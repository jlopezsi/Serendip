back in 1976 roger corman gave two of his trailer editors a few bucks and a chance to make a film joe dante and allan arkush turned out hollywood boulevard by utilizing reels of scenes cribbed from other corman films because the two directors were talented as their later films would confirm they managed to create a crazed outrageous little parody of low-budget movie-making br br roger tried it again with galactic odyssey a/k/a starquest ii not that it matters as there is no relationship to starquest alas writer-director fred gallo shows no sign of talent in either trade here br br the resulting splice job is cheap incomprehensible and should be an embarrassment to all who participated sets are strictly high school drama club acting is stilted and the swiss-cheese plot seems to be designed solely to use as much footage from other films and stock agencies(there's that mushroom cloud again)as possible while incorporating a handful of soft core sex scenes and a few gore effects br br even bad film buffs should ignore this one even for free br br
