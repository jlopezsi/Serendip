this is one of my all-time favourite horror movies right up there with texas chainsaw massacre and evil dead even though it's old and creaky even though it's mannered and any violence happens discretely off-camera the black cat somehow has the power to make me feel uneasy br br even though it has some weird stuff happening like lugosi telling his loyal servant to obey karloff does he really switch sides or is he only pretending as lugosi told him too and lugosi not just shooting karloff when he has the chance the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying lugosi's wife karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter now that is messed up br br other highlights are the skin-flaying scene really nasty and the oddball black mass where did all those people come from and how did they get to the mansion when the innocent young couple found it impossible to leave br br the black cat is an odd and uneasy treat and if you enjoy it based on this recommendation try black friday which can be found in the same lugosi box set
