synchronicity of form with the content has been an undeniable goal of art since it's conception in film that is where real magic starts and there is no master of medium that hasn't mastered this essence that is visible here as well unfortunately content if we mean intriguing story never made it in what we have is a sorry collection of characters unable to think act or express themselves shall i be guessing oppressed by their culture and this is where synchronicity starts because all the form is just equally inept unable clumsy luke warm unwilling closed-off just as the world it portrays credits to the master whose work in its success leaves me nauseated shame to the west whose taste is ignorant to all above unbearably fake ingredients cheesy pathos of music final signature of the imamura's baton not to mention insulting ethics that disturb even a sworn anti-feminist thank you very much
