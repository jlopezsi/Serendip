mediocre performances aside there were a lot of missed opportunities in this movie br br the miscasting of finney and dey is a big problem finney is not the right actor for the role of the protagonist/romantic lead and you can't help feeling he's just picking up a paycheck he certainly doesn't put any effort or sincerity into the part dey is just plain wrong in a role as a model with supposedly perfect and symmetrical features dey is cute and great in many roles but crichton really needed someone who actually has a symmetrical face br br as a director and unfortunately also as an author crichton puts much effort into some details and none at all into others why for example does the main bad guy/thug move items unnecessarily when searching an apartment the victims always notice that the items are out of place or missing that's just stupid plus why kill off people under such obvious and suspicious circumstances it's not like the police don't investigate murders an intelligent assassin also wouldn't use a submachine gun in a doctor's office the looker weapon wouldn't fit in a standard pistol holster a sink won't spray water out of the drain when hit by an errant bullet yada-yada br br there are some creepy sequences but far fewer than crichton intended worth seeing if it's on scifi but don't waste a rental on it i never did understand why it was necessary to kill any of the models either
