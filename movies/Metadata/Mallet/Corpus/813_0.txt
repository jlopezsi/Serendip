everyone is trying to be so sophisticated with their analyses of this film as if it's some sort of legitimate puzzle to be solved this is not 2045 nor 8 1/2 nor m hire this is a filming of sequences of events which cannot stem from one another br br folks the reason the director has no answer to the question of what is this film about is that the film makes no sense the viewer has no idea what's happening especially at the end what is the reality of the situation no way to know and no reason to care this is food for thought not this is nonsense br br even giving it a bye for making no sense one cannot forgive the flaws in the story line why would marc not show his wife the picture immediately why did he not try to follow her to his mother's house what reason does he have really to doubt himself br br worse the film though short drags i thought he was on that dang ferry for a week
