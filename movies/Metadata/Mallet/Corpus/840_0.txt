a holiday romance tries to overwhelm us with sentimentality like most sentimental films they sometimes annoyingly tug at your hart strings br br however sappy would not do this movie justice as an overall consensus of the film the movie will hold your interest and certainly does contain more than one dimension to the story-line and most importantly to the characters besides the romance that is brewing between mcraney and judd the film also conveys the importance of music in our lives and does a proper job in expressing its virtues more importantly the film makers for a holiday romance point out how instrumental a single individual can become in our lives especially to children br br also an extremely nice inclusion is the much loved andy griffith as mcraneys father br br by-the-way naomi judd looks absolutely great in this film you would never guess that she is two years mcraney's senior
