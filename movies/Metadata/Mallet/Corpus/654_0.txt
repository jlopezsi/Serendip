adrian monk has ocd in the same way superman has an allergy to kryptonite i love monk and this new series underscores how what may seem a disability can really be a whole new wider way of looking at the world naturally he'll need a lot of help with the disabling aspects however br br tony shalhoub is perfect in this every nuance every moment every choice is 100 his empathy with the character is profound and rather than some quirky stereotype his monk is a beautiful poetic character that will live for a longtime after the petty series characters of modern hit television fade away br br bitty schram's sharona is a lovely warm act of faith and everyone literally everyone is perfectly cast br br and along with all this warmth this is the funniest show to come along in many years br br ignore the naysayers watch it
