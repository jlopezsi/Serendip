this film won't take you very long to see but it will leave a lasting impression it's bright witty and reflective of the realities of today's society with an edginess and sophistication that tells you you're in the hands of a master filmmaker br br the actors are fabulous and the script is sharp and witty the ending is unforgettable i loved all the little lines and nuances that made it worth watching twice it's a compact piece that looks like it was fun to shoot and yet has all the impact of a much larger project i particularly liked the colorful costumes and the way they brought the innovative set to life i thought the actors were amazing and had the pleasure of meeting several of them at the screening br br i can't wait to see this writer/director's next story
