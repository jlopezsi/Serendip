i cannot forget the images that marcelo pi√±eyro conjured up and was able to capture in this film everything the visuals the literate script with its sensitive sensuous heartbreaking dialogue the suspense that does not leave you for a single minute the violent finale that you expect and still keep hoping it will not happen the exquisite acting of all the major players it will all stay with me forever i am sure this is film-making of the best kind contemporary mature it relates to reality but transcends it and reaches a perfectly beautiful artistic poetic level this is also a film that treats a gay relationship with total honesty and truth the characters have their faults but none of them has to do with their sexuality they make indeed a beautiful pair and i wish they would have had a chance to be happy together somewhere somehow at the end
