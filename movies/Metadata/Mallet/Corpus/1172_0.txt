book of caleb is a refreshing film that enjoys it's own quirks and justly so it is a film about a boy montag who with ever fiber of his being is set on never joining the bored mediocrity of the adult population so why should it fit neatly into a boring adult-oriented genre answer it shouldn't it won't this film requires an open mind and the willingness to just let it exist br br although i can understand that this film would tend to have more of a following amongst the male population i enjoyed it very much for the humanity of the characters and the plot which accurately exposed the unpredictable nature of a life well-lived i enjoyed it so much in fact that i watched it again a few days later br br congratulations to the makers of this film on a job well done
