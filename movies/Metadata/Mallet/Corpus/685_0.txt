another memorable horror movie straight from master stuart gordon.the characters are cool,the acting is really good.features a nice amount of blood and torture and a little bit of nudity.i love especially the sequence when one guy is cut in half by a huge pendulum.great music score too and rona de ricci,who plays maria is a beautiful woman.to sum up,this film is not scary at all,but absolutely worth watching
