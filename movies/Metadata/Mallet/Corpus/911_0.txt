not awful michael crichton's techo-thriller has a lot of great ideas floating around but few are really fleshed out enough to make for a really good movie albert finney plays a beverly hills plastic surgeon who stumbles upon a plot to kill off models many of whom were his patients the trail leads to a conglomerate run by oily james coburn and his sexy goon leigh taylor young what he uncovers is a pretty clever plot to replace the models with computer generated replicas thus allowing them to work forever without aging or getting paid unfortunately the leaden pacing of the movie does it in finney seems surprisingly engaged but crichton has directed nothing in fact his direction here as it was with coma is so without personality it has a deadening affect on everything coburn is fine in an all too brief role and susan dey is terrific as one of finney's luckier patients
