i saw this in italian in italy apparently italians don't like sub-titles i missed the start and came in only at the moustache-shaving scene so as i don't speak italian or french i think it's a sign that it's a better film than it might appear that i understood and enjoyed it so much though i thought it very sad br br if i understood it correctly it's extremely misogynistic but most men will have recognised the situations and understand the feelings br br i just think it's a good sign that such an apparently wordy film can be made to communicate on a non-verbal level br br i didn't recognise any of the actors though my wife tells me that the actress who played the mother is in the lurpak ads so my understanding wasn't led by anything i might have expected from them
