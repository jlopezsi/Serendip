the most fascinating thing about this movie is the wildly diverging responses it produces br br i thought it was rubbish from beginning to end br br the way in which the alien functions is not made clear at all perhaps deliberately to camouflage the inconsistencies in the plot so that many events make no sense the obligatory romantic interest is as boring as it gets the ending seems copied from any old slasher movie where the monster simply won't stay down br br a waste of sutherland who's always worth watching and warner who's extremely beautiful in a low-key unglamorous way
