google for jack and jennifer clips and steve and kayla and you will come across a goldmine of clips that will tell you the entire story of the johnson family from steve's arrival onto the show to jack and jennifer's first wedding br br and oh my if there isn't a boatload of pain heartache from joy garrett's achingly wonderful portrayal of jo johnson to steve nichols and matt ashford playing long-lost-brothers with so much history of pain between them br br matt ashford is one of the best actors out there and steve nichols is incredible too watching the two interact has always been a treat br br ken corday let go of an incredible amount of potential for amazing storytelling when he decided that jack had to leave with jennifer br br days today is all about the couples the only time people interact with others is to whine about their significant other or plot to steal someone elses significant other br br there is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it and that is the glue that holds the show together br br i'm saddened to see that a show that i watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when steve and matt and mary beth returned is still going to be so terrible br br it's not too late for nbc to fix this but i'm guessing these pleas will fall on deaf ears
