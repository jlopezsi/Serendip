i saw this film yesterday and was not impressed the acting was pretty bad the gore effects were not great the story was lacking and the music was terrible especially during the action sequences br br but i kinda enjoyed myself watching it there were a few jokes and most of them were not funny most of the fun was because of the lacking script at some points it was just so stupid it was funny i also found the killer clown's remarks entertaining even though none of them really had much to do with the story and the concept of a killer clown though a bit clich is still pretty funny br br this film is pretty bad but it's entertaining if you can ignore the flaws just sit back and laugh at the unfortunate teens
