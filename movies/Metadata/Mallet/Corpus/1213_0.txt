i remember trying to get into this film in new york city on a friday night and it was sold out imdb doesn't list its box office but i remember that it was quite popular it was around the beginning of meryl as goddess this was her 10th film and before sophie's choice the rest of the stars are roy scheider and jessica tandy scheider gets drawn into the murder of one of his patients after a visit from a mysterious woman streep who worked with and had an affair with the victim he goes back in his mind over some of his sessions with his patient including a vivid dream and finds himself living it br br if you know and love the big guy hitchcock as much as i do you'll enjoy this film just picking out all the hitchcock touches others on this board have mentioned the cool blonde streep looking gorgeous the psychiatrist mother and the dream spellbound a shot reminiscent of rear window the presence of jessica tandy the birds the ordinary man drawn into strange circumstances the auction scene north by northwest and of course the shadow of a doubt reference scheider's uncle charlie br br still of the night is gimmicky cold and strangely memorable look at the various posts and see how many people remember where and when they saw it streep is excellent in her cool blonde role though it's not a great part however her monologue toward the end of the film is very compelling scheider is just right as the psychiatrist and tandy is wonderful as his mother though her role is too small br br others mention that the film moves slowly until the end the ending is very suspenseful and exciting but i didn't feel the rest of the movie was slow i felt like i was being set up for something as it turned out i was br br recommended for lovers of hitchcock and those who have not seen much early streep
