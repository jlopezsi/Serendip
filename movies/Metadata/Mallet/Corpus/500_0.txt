i was a great fan of the blues brothers when i was a kid i used to get my dad to rent it every single week in the days before you could buy it i'd watch the car chases over and over again and to this day can recite whole reams of dialogue bb 2000 i thought can't be as good but it must be worth seeing br br how wrong i was br br i have tried but i regret to say that i can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever not one the dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted forced wholly unrecognisable as everyday english the addition of the little kid and the black forgotten brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal the car chases were overblown without being entertaining and the plot was sadly not even laughable i only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about no chance even the usually excellent john goodman was well below par and this is to say nothing of the washed up ackroyd br br terribly photographed crippled by being utterly devoid of plot jokes charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste i can honestly say that bb2k ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time this film took me two long hours closer to my death i suggest you do not let it do the same to you
