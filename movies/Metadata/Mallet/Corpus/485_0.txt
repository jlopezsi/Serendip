the blues brothers franchise self destructs why was a classic baby boomer goof off movie made showing its middle age trepidations what's next the blues brothers country club what has the kid to do with anything anyway these were some of the thoughts that seared my mind as i watched this kluge of a movie and like buggy software every time you thought it was finally working it froze up on itself the music which was the hit of the original flick seems stale even trite in this one the car chases and crashes look like the out takes from the 1980 version what humor there is is almost disney like cutesy instead of funky and brash where was the kid's skate board and puppy who were they afraid of offending to whom were they pandering guess br br this movie was made for the advertisers who product placement seemed to be the only real concern of the moviemakers we never expected a plot but gad would someone get a fresh set of monkeys at the dialoge typewriter please all the shortcomings of the original flick were duplicated like from rote the only message in this movie was when you're big enough you don't have to care anymore just flip out some left overs and some scraps the adoring masses will tremble in gratitude this movie is an unintenitional self parody a seemingly endless grinding and rebooting of a failed concept its a serious downer in almost every respect rent the original if you've never seen it then staple on a hurl handbag to watch this chewy-as-gravel poke in the eye be warned next you'll see blues brothers visit the muppet babies on ice will a blues brother(c become a furpy c or a poke'mon c does anyone care anymore thanks for decimating an american icon into a fast food franchise theme meal
