as far back as i can remember my sisters and i have been fascinated with this film i guess that would be my whole life since i was born in 81 we had a tape of sea prince and the fire child and it was watched so often that it started to deteriorate my father would get mad because we didnt care if we ruined the vrc as long as we could watch our movie i wish i could find another copy of it as ours went mysteriously missing my favourite character would have to be bibble if i remember correctly thats his name but the summary says the fire child's name is marta i guess the way sirius always said it made us confused because we called her malta but really this is one of the best memories of my childhood if anyone knows where i can get a tape let me know
