i was surprised to read some of these unfavorable reviews the 30s was my favorite era in film history and this is one of my favorites it's not my man godfrey or it happened one night but it's very enjoyable i love the scene when her servants reveal themselves i thought montgomery was charming and adorable as usual powell was as awesome as ever and crawford was perfectly cast she has the edge that makes her believable as a con artist i'm curious to see the original pre-code version if only tcm would show it i doubt it's better though norma shearer was so weepy-eyed and hokey and i wouldn't buy her as a con artist
