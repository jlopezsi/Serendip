four stars give me a break br br i was thrilled and amused when i saw this as a kid so many unconventional scenes so many people who don't behave br br alright this is not that entertaining for people of today who have lost any attention span and it's not as brilliantly made as where's poppa also written by robert klane but it does have its moments i.e most scenes that arkin and gardenia are in reiner is pretty inept here as usual though kay medford is very good as a mother out of touch with reality a good cast in general br br some scenes lack a better execution but on the whole this is an original idea that has several subplots which are nicely tied up greed ineptness dysfunctional families madness and irritation manifest themselves in many different ways br br most locations are pretty awful by today's viewing habits but that is the exact charm of this movie as opposed to all the slick and sterile over-produced forgettable comedies of today the settings make this movie look real and might tend to make people uneasy about the story because it seems people don't really get their way no matter how they try that makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach you make a fool of yourself br br the main problem with this seems to be that the ideas are funny but better production and direction would not have hurt this could very well be remade but i doubt people today want to see anyone on the screen who is over 40 years old and that is pathetic
