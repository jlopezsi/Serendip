what a powerful story so powerful to me at least that i have only watched it one other time and have little desire to see it again even though it's a fine movie it's too frustrating a story for me frankly i could not have done what orson welles character did in this film welles by the way is outstanding in here he claudette colbert george brent and richard long provide some wonderful acting br br long playing the elder son presents a tremendous contrast of how a young man acted back in the 1940s compared to nowadays in terms of of respect and manners the little girl in here is played by natalie wood i wouldn't have known it was her had she not been mentioned on the back of the video box she has blonde hair and is about five or six years old and does an impressive job speaking german br br this is a real heart-rendering story the only drawback is the credibility of colbert's character elizabeth hamilton the wife of welles a supposed war victim and gone for years after his marriage to her wells despite now having a beard and aging a bit would still be recognizable at the least audibly to his former wife it was asking a bit much to believe she wouldn't realize it was him but it's still good storytelling and a film that hits you deeply speaking about the last point if you liked 1942's random harvest you probably would like this too
