i've had my fair share of experience with jackie chan films and have come to learn that the stories in his movies do not make or break them rather they're merely a backdrop upon which countless hand-to-hand fights and slapstick humor are placed and while they're not necessarily thought-provoking they are by no means a waste of time to individuals who enjoy more intellectual entertainment br br but with twin dragons it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui br br the film's worst traits are perhaps its predictability and repetition for example in the beginning we are introduced to the two single elements which will play out implacably for the remainder of the film confusion in regards to which of the twins is who and how when one of the twins performs one action the other is psychically affected and carries it out as well the film apparently thrives on this to the point where it becomes tiresome after about half an hour and the manner in which it does it leads one to seriously question the mental capacity of the individuals involved never in a movie have i seen women portrayed to be such imbeciles br br a couple of the action scenes are worth mention but the unfortunate aspect of the matter is that unless one watches them separately from the rest of the film there really isn't much to attract attention that is by the time that we have been subjected to the asininity of all the supporting characters in the dialogue sections of the film we really do not want to see them partake in the fights and more than once i found myself wishing that the screenwriters had done away with these characters earlier in the story so as to not involve them in any but one or two of the action sequences br br for the casual movie watcher i would consider this to be poison stay away at any cost even if you're paid to watch this film die-hard jackie chan fans may enjoy a couple of scenes which display a little wit as to how to incorporate chan's natural charm into the eccentricity of the situations and some of the stunts are somewhat impressing though nowhere near the caliber of some of those that he has performed in the latter half of the 90s
