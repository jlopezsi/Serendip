this is a long line of hollywood nazi propaganda bombs that are funded by the immensely wealthy nazi party again all we get are a pitiful excuse to kill as many brunette women as possible it has become a joke and would be funny if it weren't for the wackos who think that this makes a film a classic that makes it dangerous on the surface it is about a roswell type affair searching for an alien cover up by the government try to make sense out of that no you can't since the military could ask for billions of dollars more in budget if they could show evidence of aliens so we have the most ludicrous idea since those idiots who thought leonardo da vinci met jesus christ and knew his lineage but the propaganda like most nazi propaganda is not even subtle how any person can not see this is beyond comprehension br br what is really horrible is that great scripts and ideas are shot down by producers and directors for crap like this
