the roman catholic church has begun to turn away from the inquisition finding its methods and motives more than just a little bit suspect but the grand inquisitor of spain lance henriksen has other plans he is his own authority allegedly guided by god himself a baker and his wife end up on the wrong side of the law his law when they protest an execution and she is accused of witchcraft br br lance henriksen has a bad habit of appearing in many low budget horror films so much so that any credibility he gained as bishop from aliens or frank black from millenium is overshadowed by his constant self-degradation did we really need so many pumpkinhead films but pit and the pendulum is one of those films i remember fondly from my childhood and even today feel carries on well as a timeless classic br br unlike other full moon films this one has a steady plot and interesting characters and a decent cast mark margolis shows up and jeffrey combs has a relatively small but crucial role to play combs like henriksen has sold out in recent years but his very presence makes a film better there's excessive but not gratuitous nudity bloody torture devices but not to the point of exploitation like saw just for entertainment this is a fun film in the vein of say the original troll but not troll 2 br br i can understand wanting to avoid this film but i think you'd be making a mistake it's hard to find films that are this much fun today blending horror and pure enjoyment isn't impossible but it seems to be a dying art make this one a must-see on your list
