in thinking through this movie i struggled to recall one honest character i believe it is barbara's mother she is straightforward to the point of naivet the other assorted crew are great though i mean if we were all like i can't remember her name she is so innocuous well then we wouldn't have a movie or any color to the world would we br br the most dishonest of the lot is armand watch the cigarette in his first scene with albert in drag williams is obviously using it to symbolize that he is in fact hiding something from his life-partner and that something is rodrigo note his eyes when he communicates with the waiter in the restaurant scene i mention this because the birdcage is about deceit some funny some not it is about people trying to be what they aren't to please someone else and of course failing along the way this film is a lot of fun it is a sympathetic look at a life style most of us wouldn't otherwise see and that's worth a lot br br this is a great ensemble good actors an excellent script an interesting premise a very very good film br br but here's my question after all is said and done why does armand tell katherine at the end that we are very proud of him in reference to val while i understand val's motives why would a parent be proud of dishonesty of urging denial of who one is of plain stupidity in expecting no matter the outcome of one evening that his father in law could be eternally fooled yes i know i know it's all plot and not real but still i would have scratched that line as there is no supporting evidence that val the center of this tornado is anything but selfish br br that said i like this film
