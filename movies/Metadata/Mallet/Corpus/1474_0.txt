yes some of the events in this movie may be predictable but i really loved this movie it's got everything scares heartbreak sadness pain happiness everything except a sappy love story included i really like leelee sobieski and i think she's a great actress she's totally a young helen hunt i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be scared just not to the point of terror
