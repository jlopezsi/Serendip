it has been said before but i came to the same conclusion so it must be said again if you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie super-glossy image decent acting though i find sobieski pretty boring as a lead and a good minimalist music score can't do much when the clumsy screenplay has so many conveniences the heroine seems to have a mysterious knack for being in the right place at the right time to see/hear/find everything she needs to piece the truth together the only well-handled aspect of the film is the subtle sexual tension between sobieski and skarsgard but this sub-plot is soon dropped 1/2
