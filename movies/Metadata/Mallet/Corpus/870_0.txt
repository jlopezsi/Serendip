when this tvm was made in 1999 i was still somewhat ignorant of the internet certainly i'd heard of it but being something of a luddite i failed to see why more and more people were becoming interested in it and it wasn't until august 2001 that i become connected to the world wide web one thing i did notice about netforce is that if i remained ignorant about the internet this tvm wouldn't have appeared so bad to me br br mild spoilers br br one thing that really irritated me is how the writers seem to have confused computer technology with an all encompassing thing called the internet for example the bad guys are able to gain access to the security systems of a maximum security prison via the internet what you mean the computerised door locking system must connected to the internet in some way we see umpteen examples of this ridiculous thinking that because something is computerised it must be connected to the internet in someway no no no computerised systems and the internet are not the one and the same for example if the internet collapsed tomorrow computers would still work even if it means you can't send emails or write reviews at the imdb i could still use my computer as a word processor or play computer games etc the world wouldn't suddenly revert to the stone age because the internet failed br br there's also several other blunders which led me to believe that the writers are nowhere near as being smart as their audience if a computer hacker is deleting his system this can be jammed by sticking a floppy disk in the hard drive what a floppy disk it's never explained why this stops the system being deleted perhaps the good guys were carrying a back up copy of the villains system we're also told to believe that some real hot internet systems can't be traced because they don't use cookies as for the vr sex wtf br br there's also a ridiculous aspect to the team known as netforce each member is a computer wizard and a crack secret agent in effect they're a combination of a computer geek and a delta force member is this logical or realistic why does a member have to be both a computer expert and an elite law enforcement agent why can't the organisation employ computer wizards to track down rogue computer operators and then send a crack team of commandos to round up the bad guys br br the whole feel of this tvm screams tv pilot and i don't believe for a moment that tom clancey and co didn't toy with the idea that this would end up as a long running series but the flaws are instantly obvious there's only a certain amount of plots in any genre and this techno thriller lasting three hours has used up all potential plots in one go be honest just how long could you tolerate scott bakula as an action hero who spends 50 of an episode typing on a computer 40 of an episode flirting with his female colleague and 10 of an episode shooting bad guys
