i believe the original story that this film is based on is called second variety a great post-apocalyptic novel by sci-fi meister philip k dick the film captures some of the terror from the original story but director christian duguay and storywriter dan obannon fails to deliver the film that this had the potential to become philip k dick's stories adapted to film have previously been great successes like blade runner and total recall so why duguay and obannon chose to rewrite the ending completely into one of the worst cases of hollywood happy ending i've ever seen and in doing so completely removing the the entire plot of the original story leaves me a bit provoked br br my vote 4 out of 10
