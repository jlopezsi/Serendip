strictly background is a great film two thumbs way up there is a reason it has won so many awards and been featured at so many festivals director jason connell does a good job of picking interesting characters to follow and then keeps the film moving the music editing and special effects also add to the momentum it really sheds light on the extras industry and shows the ups and downs of being in it you really feel for these guys finally these extras get to be the stars in this film bravo it's all around fun it's a must see can't wait to see what connell has up his sleeve for his next project he's one to keep an eye on
