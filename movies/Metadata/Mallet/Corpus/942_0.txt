if you have a vivid imagination and your mind likes to wonder you will be wonderfully rewarded by watching this dennis potter gem it has a great fifties soundtrack and music numbers that are choreographed with exciting imagination but maybe dennis needed to get out a bit more the characters are well casted and there performances are extremely well delivered as an added bonus you get to see ewen mcgregor before he went to the dark side i watched this show when it was first released on television more than ten years ago and loved it and after a recent viewing found the show had not lost any of it's edge maybe hard to find now but if you have not seen it hunt it down enjoy
