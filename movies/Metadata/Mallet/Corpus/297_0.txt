stories by philip k dick always get transformed into good science fiction films first there was blade runner then came total recall and now we have screamers br br screamers is fairly low-budgeted i think around 10 12 million dollars but it is really really good the script is ace because its written by dan o'bannon alien total recall and the director knows exactly what he's doing it stars peter weller from robocop and he really shines as an actor in this film andy lauer who plays the rookie who is ironically nicknamed ace is also very good as are roy dupois who plays the mysterious becker and jennifer rubin who plays jessica br br the story is interesting and has a sense of paranoia because you never know who is a screamer a killer robot and who isn't the futuristic sets of a war-ravaged planet are also excellent and the costumes and props to go with it are good too br br the only thing that lets it down are the special effects for some parts they are ok like the spaceship taking off at the end but the rest are not so good such as the stop-motion screamers that are outdated and when becker gets shot in half br br overall i think this is a very good movie if it had a slightly higher budget to sort out those special effects it would get full marks but as it is i give it 8/10
