i only paid 1.00 to see this movie and i still felt ripped off i stuck around assuming it would get better or at least hoping i could laugh at it's badness but neither happened it was not cheesy enough to laugh at and it was so terrible i actually experienced physical pain while watching it the talents of del toro and walken were completely wasted in this lame excuse for entertainment
