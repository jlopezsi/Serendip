if you just look at the bare-bones descriptions on a lot of noirs it can be pretty hard to tell them apart i thought i remembered seeing this solid entry years ago in a mini de toth retrospective but i was mistaken it's a flavorful entry if nothing terribly original or memorable notable for its harsh verite-style lighting and camera-work excellent usage of los angeles locations this is one of the best representations of 50s la i've seen on film and a really terrific cast with sterling hayden and charles bronson the most well-known respectively playing the cop in charge of finding a trio of escaped cons and the most thuggish of the escapees but hardly the only quality players gene nelson as steve lacey the ex-con trying to straighten out his life until it is intruded upon by one of the trio dying in his living room and phyllis kirk as his devoted wife do a fine job with relatively stereotypical roles dub taylor and jay novello have nice small character roles and you'll even find crazy timothy carey playing a wide-eyed laughing maniac in a couple of scenes near the end the film does fall a little flat in the third act with a fairly predictable ending that feels more positive and hollywood than a great noir usually should but it's a nice entry and there aren't too many wasted moments in the 73-minute running time as usual a well-mastered dvd from warner home video packaged with the slightly more interesting decoy
