robert de niro and billy crytal star in analyze this.i loved this film a lot robert de niro and billy crytal work so well together is that really such a surprise that two great actors would do great in a film well i thought that de nirop and pacino would do well in righteous kill i never saw that film but i heard it was crap which was a bit of surprising news this film reminds me a bit of the hugh grant comedy mickey blue eyes though this film is a bit better not a bit but a lot not that mickey blue eyes was bad it just wasn't as good as this to wrap up my review i will say that this is a great film from harold ramis who is a great director i don't know how you could get a better mob comedy though i loved the whole nine yards br br analye this
