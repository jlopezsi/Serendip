i first watched tokyo cowboy at a film festival in troms norway and at that time considered it one of the best films i have ever seen now 12 years later i have gotten the dvd after a lot of struggle and re-watched it the conclusion is the same in spite of the many films i have seen in these 12 years this is a top-ten for me delightful story which combines humor and depth the much-more-talked-about lost in translation does not come up to this one but translation is of course not a bad movie br br one could say that the wisdom of tokyo cowboy is a bit simple and obvious yet these themes one cannot discuss and dwell over enough to find oneself in this complex world the road in my heart as the main character puts it will never go out-of-date highly recommended watch it you will not be disappointed greetings from oslo norway
