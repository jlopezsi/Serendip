i saw this just-about-perfect film when it screened at the maryland film festival in may 2005 set in a small town it tells the story of a chesapeake bay waterman's family as they pass through a crisis the movie is superbly cast with both famous cherry jones and unknown actors giving fine nuanced performances the chesapeake bay currently suffers significant ecological degradation from farm runoff industrial pollution and other factors this has severely impacted crab oyster and fish populations and hence the livelihood of traditional bay water-men it is against this backdrop of economic struggle that the movie's story is told already poor and unable to afford health insurance the family is pushed past the breaking point when their young daughter suffers a swimming injury and needs surgery
