no kid can take on twice his size come on i just didn't get it.the kid actually manages to save everyone from a bad guy normally bad guys aren't so dumb the way hutch hits baby is so fake it was a touching movie but i didn't think it was all that if you know what i mean i see why the kid actors haven't acted in anything else everyone i know hates this movie it's hard to believe it actually made it on the air although i said this movie is terrible it's not as bad as from justin to kelly that was bad i have to agree with someone else on this the songs and hand-clapping games were nice touches for all the future watchers of this movie change the channel after you see a blonde kid with a baseball cap that he's wearing backwards this is where its starts to turn terrible
