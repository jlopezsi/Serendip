due to gillian anderson's real-life pregnancy she needed to be written out of the show for a little while to deliver her baby duane barry begins the storyline that was written to get around this situation i think the scully abduction storyline was very well done throughout the course of the series it's funny that this real-life event brought about this fantastic storyline continuing with its tradition of great guest stars steve railsback gives an incredible performance as the abductee duane barry this episode is low on action but high on drama as mulder negotiates with duane barry in a hostage situation my only hang-up with this episode is the about face of agent lucy kazdin at first she tells mulder that what duane barry needs is a friend someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason she also say so whatever crap you got to make up about space men or ufos just keep him on the phone then later she abruptly changes her mind and tells mulder not to feed into duane's psychosis when mulder says he believes him i don't see those two strategies as compatible either you go along with duane's aliens or you don't it just doesn't make any sense however it's a minor issue and the every other aspect of the episode is great the ending scene in scully's apartment is chilling and memorable
