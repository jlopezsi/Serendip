i had not heard of the film until i saw it on the turner movie classics schedule seeing the subject matter and the 1944 date excited me the writer director and cast would be playing out the issues in real time as the die was cast i grew up in a household conflicted with stories and opinions of nazi germany my mother is jewish my father was german and raised by a father who supported hitler i have always been fascinated by germans who seem to be good people who choose to ignore the eventual outcome of hitler's madness and defend germany's need for him br br the characters each have their unique perspective and reaction to emil as played masterfully by skip homeier the desire to see only the good in a human being with no expectation that they are dealing with a fully brainwashed evil acting thug is such an american trait this movie is simply made and concentrates closely on the story and it's the story and the acting that is compelling i think you will enjoy it if you enjoy a good psychological study my husband was disappointed with the ending i however was overjoyed and cried p s it was nice to see agnes moorehead in her role i have never seen her play such a normal person
