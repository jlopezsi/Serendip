you know one of those slashers that you shouldn't take seriously at all this is one such film i have never laughed with a horror film for a long time usually i watch horror/slashers to be scared but sometimes very rarely i watch them for the laughs i guess i got tired of all the big hit horror movies and decided to go back to b movies br br the movie starts out with a group of white kids trying to act gangster they are calling each other the n word and stuff they stop at hellaburger to get something to eat but get more than they bargained for right when they pull up they talk into the speaker and the person on the other end says a bunch of extremely vulgar and sexual remarks about the people in the car as one of them orders their food the other attempts to break in to steal the cash they meet horny the clown a man dressed up in a freaky clown suit a voice changer attached to the mask and uses a machete for a weapon he says a lot of cheesy lines and one of them was stolen from the shining it was the line when jack tells wendy that i'm not going to hurt you i'm just going to bash your brains in right the bleep in he says it exactly like jack why should i care i'm having too much fun br br then you meet mackenzie carpenter(leighton meester and her group of friends and they all have one connection and don't even know it they are all killed one by one and they have no idea why that is until toward the end of the film the mother of mackenzie reveals that the man in the clown suit doing all the killing was bullied by them when they were all in high school he was accidentally knocked out and the restaurant burned down all around him killing him they thought he was dead but apparently not he is back from the dead to get revenge on the kids this was stolen from nightmare on elm street once again why should i care i'm having too much fun watching this flick br br i didn't see the ending because i was cut off for some reason it was a good slasher and i would recommend it to those who want a laugh br br 10 stars out of 10 if you don't die from fast food horny will get ya
