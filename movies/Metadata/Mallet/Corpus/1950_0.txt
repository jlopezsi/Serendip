as an ardent scholar of b-movies i found particular delight when happening upon this little piece unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any good b-movie this film has plenty of it dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic ill-defined meandering characters loads of unexplained shots scenes and material-this is not the best b-movie i have seen but it is entertaining nonetheless the effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film and sure to get the biggest laughs especially the end but a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting read gosset jr vague characters read the british/australian/whatever shark killers/photographers and terribly edited action so for b-movie fans i give this a 3 out of 5
