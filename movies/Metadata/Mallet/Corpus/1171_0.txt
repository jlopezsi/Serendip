i first saw the trailer for the book of caleb on the cinemassacre.com website the trailer had me sold from the first mention of the fabled upper decker so i paid for the digital download and checked it out br br the movie delivered on the trailer's promise and shows that this group of creative people is a group to watch they really have the chops to do something great this isn't your average oddity that you find on the internet have a couple seconds of amusement and then forget about this is a legit movie from obviously talented filmmakers br br if i had to compare the movie to anything else i'd probably say wes anderson's work specifically bottle rocket this film has a similar quirky sense of humor a boys will be boys attitude and a way of making the mundane seem epic without getting sidetracked with self-importance the movie maintains a great sense of humor and is never pretentious br br there is definitely a unique voice here most of the performances are solid especially for such an independent film and the technical credits are all solidly professional br br i'm going to recommend this one to some like-minded friends and think it could really take off from word of mouth definitely worth discovering
