i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 only because i got to see a lot of adam baldwin and i do mean a lot one has to wonder how on earth no pun intended they got ahold of him for this film as well as robert englund br br it was quite awhile before i realized the same actor who played major mitchell in id4 is the same actor who played jayne in serenity i was so intrigued by my inability to see that they were the same actor i'm usually very good at recognizing people that i figured this adam baldwin must be one fine actor when i saw he was also in this even-bad-for-a-roger-corman flick i just had to watch no matter how bad it was and it was bad really bad br br but i endured being the firefly serenity fan that i am if i ever get to meet adam baldwin in-person i will just have to ask him why
