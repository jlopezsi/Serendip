released amid a horde of korean romantic comedies following the success of my sassy girl singles i found was not simply another manufactured commodity it broke some major clich√©s that are risky for any studio film to deviate from there was realistic acting of genuine human behaviors underneath the surface of light-hearted humor which may i add is very funny i would even consider this film to be a great painting of the common people a lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films and while singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments which are highly enjoyable i found it to resemble life more than most genre films and if art is to imitate life then i consider singles to be a successful work of art it's great to see films incorporating both wild entertainment and something meaningful that we can take away from
