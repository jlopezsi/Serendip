ring and ring 2's ability to terrify an audience relied strongly on the fact that the tv you were watching them on was a possible portal for the video-curse and even sadako herself not that anyone would really believe sadako would come out of your tv but subconsciously it must have an effect in ring 0 birthday there are no cursed videos and no televisions instead 0 takes us back 30 years before the original ring to where sadako is an apprentice for a theatre company what we quickly learn is that sadako is not a monstrous psychic-killer that springs from household appliances but a shy troubled young woman with a secret past those familiar with the ring films will know that sadako killed a mocking reporter at her mother's para-psychological demonstration after he accused the psychic of being a fraud the fianc of this reporter sets about investigating what went on and tracks down sadako at the theatre convinced that she is responsible in some way for her fianc s death br br the theatre troupe has a bad feeling about sadako as most of them have been experiencing the same disturbing dream about her where they see her next to a well and a certain air of doom has clouded the theatre since her arrival when the lead actress in the play dies killed by a younger sadako who is more like the ghoul from the first two films it's confusing but things are explained later sadako is given her role much to the distress and suspicion of her fellow actors the appearance of the dark sadako coincides with a strange noise played from a reel-to-reel tape recorder used by the theatre to play music this it seems is how sadako's dark power is unleashed much like the videotape of the originals but the older sadako does not initiate any of the terror unleashed and it is only a matter of time before the troupe accuses her of being a killer whereas in reality she possesses the power to heal questions arise throughout the film and are frequently answered like why are two sadako's of different ages walking around in the theatre yes this question is answered but not here in this review ring 0 is much more character based than the two previous films getting into the head of the tragic sadako by means of flashbacks and a subtle love story that shows she is a decent vulnerable human being at first it is slightly confusing as you are not sure whether you are watching the sadako that will turn into the deformed freakish ghoul that crawls out of tv screens to scare people to death but it is knowing who she ends up to be that gives the film an air of tragedy as this misunderstood and innocent girl is hunted like a beast and forced to become one with her evil side to say any more about the story would inevitably spoil it so i'll go no further but for those worried about a lack of an evil sadako don't worry she's there too br br visually ring 0 is a much more lavish expensive-looking production than its predecessors that relied on dark gritty camera-work and realistic lighting to enhance the normal and make the story more believable with 0 the style is more polished with swooping camera moves and clearer more stylised lighting this works as the film is more layered than ring whose visuals suited its single-minded determination to scare you witless instead here we have a production just as interested in characterisation and story whilst also being very very scary in places which is helped by the excellent photography and set design br br the acting is first rate especially from yukie nakama who gives a subtle performance as sadako and everyone else is on form the only let down is some of the terrible screaming going on here remember the castle of aaarrrrggggghhhhhh from monty python and the holy grail well people die whilst omitting these terrible comedy death-groans that really do steal from the tension and give you a mental picture of graham chapman in chain mail apart from that i don't think 0 could be a better film br br director norio tsuruta delivers a consistent suspenseful shocker with plenty of visual flourishes and interesting ideas it's easy to think that in the wrong hands sadako could have been turned into a freddy/jason-style stalker walking amongst the shadows willing people to death but instead we have an entertaining character piece with plenty of frights and chills spliced in for good measure br br ring 0 surprised me it is a more solid film than the original more layered and ultimately more rewarding but what it lacks is the pure raw fear of the original that made it so memorable and it wouldn't work without seeing the original first better and scarier than 2 quite possibly on a par with the first and if you thought sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the tv in ring sit tight because sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the off button on their remote control br br if you're a ring fan you've got to see this if you've never seen them you won't get it if you've seen them and didn't like them still give this one a try as it's a completely different experience altogether
