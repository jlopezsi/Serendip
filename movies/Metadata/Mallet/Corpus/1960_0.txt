what a terrific little film this is made in 1973 on what was presumably a very low budget this two-hander about a pair of research scientists experimenting on apes in a remote mountain science station is a lean and mean horror-thriller put together with maximum conviction a haunting atmosphere and stratospherically good performances br br robert culp and eli wallach brilliantly portray the disintegrating relationship between the two men as each comes to suspect the other with tampering with the heating systems despoiling the food and generally fouling things up br br having discovered the previous lone occupant of the research outpost frozen to death it seems something very sinister is haunting the men what could it possibly be i won't spoil things by revealing the solution to the mystery it works extremely well and the moment when the nearly frozen culp manages to get back into the station and confronts wallach axe in hand is one of the classic scenes of horror t.v or otherwise br br it's a film which draws you in gradually relying on small moments to unsettle and rivet the viewer this in its own way is as good as spielberg's duel a treat for a first time viewer br br please please please somebody somewhere get this released on dvd one of the best things ever produced by the medium it deserves remastering preservation on a grand scale
