although it is certainly dated today the black cat was sublimely ahead of it's time in 1934 conseqently it was derided by critics and enjoyed only middling success considering the star power involved many people including some in universal studio's hierarchy regarded the film as a nihilistic study in murder satan worship sadism and even necrophilia br br of course what struck the masses as impudent seventy years ago seems audacious today in many ways the black cat is a bold striking piece of work that captures two of horror film's greatest players at the top of their game boris karloff with his new-wave hairstyle and snake-like eyes personifies irredeemable evil he fails to convince only when his character is forced into mock-congeniality his most effective moments are not when he casts his sinister glare at bela lugosi or jacqueline wells but when he plays the organ or stands outside amidst the windswept trees enraptured by his thoughts of the black mass to come meanwhile lugosi blessed with a sympathetic almost heroic role contributes one of his all-time best performances an exquisitely measured portrait of a man determined to do right by the young couple he is forced by circumstance to protect but doomed to die in the house of his most hated foe br br fine camera-work and art direction guided by edgar g ulmer's helming make this film striking to look at and brisk to sit through the only real demerits are the obligatory romantic couple peopled here by david manners and the aforementioned ms wells their acting and dialogue somehow strain credulity more than boris and bela's motivations ever could also the weak comic relief provided by two quarrelsome policemen is brittle at best although it's interesting to hear lugosi speak in his native hungarian in the scene but both elements were no doubt concessions to the taste of 1930's audiences br br like almost all of the early 30's horror films the black cat is imperfect and antiquated but also like almost all of the early 30's horror films it is unique ingenious in it's way and still worthy of discovery by a new generation
