luc besson was on a hot streak in the late 80s/early 90s and la femme nikita or just nikita for short is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding the spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky as there's the chance for too much one-dimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist a young punk anne parillaud in her most recognizable near star-making performance who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization and given an ultimatum become a spy/assassin or die she complies and in a few years time turns into josephine who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid's outfit to serve potential targets or to ready herself to kill someone long-range at a moment's notice br br besson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between nikita/josephine/marie her boss bob and her conventional lover marco a grocery store cashier who doesn't know what she really does besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller and from time to time it could appear like la femme nikita will veer into that realm and not return but besson is smart he crafts the first hour like a kind of taming of the shrew saga or taming of a shrill bad-ass filled with juicy dark humor ranging from the ultra-violent pencil in the hand anyone to the silly and playful training with karate instructors and as pure director of action sequences besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters it's succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with bob even in the little things like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel works on the purest technical terms br br but la femme nikita for the most part also works on emotional levels too besson won't be above throwing in a hard-boiled killer in the midst jean reno's victor my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes and a precursor to leon but he'll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure i loved seeing when josephine has to take out the woman in venice her shot in sight and is moved to tears through the words that marco speaks to her truthfully not in any terms that deem him as the boring safe character but as her kind of salvation from a life that she's been forced into as a final alternative as happens often in besson's work in fact the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and at the least harrowing times with the one she cares for or about i.e portman in leon leeloo in fifth element joan of arc even angela in angel-a it's not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman it's essential to besson's track as a filmmaker and praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through sometimes in the same scene br br this isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities if only from my perspective the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and weather channel muzak the ending felt abrupt or at least on a first viewing albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's hq and as a minor criticism what happened to showing how nikita learns how to smile seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over when made to seem like a big stepping stone by jeanne moreau's enigmatic character otherwise a must-see and one of besson's best films
