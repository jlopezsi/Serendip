what does o.c stand for in the vastly superior national lampoon articles that ran from 1980 to 1984 it stood for out of control the nickname of the character william o.c ogilvy in the lame altman film it stood for oliver cromwell ogilvie br br that is the whole problem with this movie it should have been out of control fun but it ends up as a lame reference to social significance altman tries to take a tried and true formula of a wacky teen sex comedy a valid wonderful and meaningful genre of american cinema just like film noir and violates it by bringing in bad actors crappy cinematography and worst of all some sort of message of what this aged and senile director thinks is the problems of youth in reagan era america br br at least the previous nl effort vacation they had a good director nl alumni harold ramis satisfactory actors and the story was fairly close to the original john hughes piece none of the actors here save jon cryer are interesting funny or even remotely close to the few characters brought over from the nl articles they added other lame characters for no reason such as oc's grandfather wasting the talents of ray walston not even the amazing sounds of king sunny ade can save this film they are only in this film for a five minute cameo what i cannot understand is that by 1984 when this film was made it was so bad it was quietly released three years later why did nl not give this film to a reliable director such as harold ramis john landis amy heckerling or john hughes br br all i can say is to look over the thirty some reviews of this movie and see how the lines are drawn those who loved this movie have never read or had it read to them the articles of oc stiggs that graced the pages of national lampoon those who abhor this movie are those who can read and have enjoyed and lived their lives according to the gospel of oc stiggs as written in the brilliant national lampoon articles br br if you want the story of oc stiggs read the original articles they're on the net and should be required reading in all schools churches and drinking establishments if you want to see a funny teen sex comedy rent classics american pie porky's or private resort if you want to see and here king sunny ade and his infectious ju-ju sound rent konkombe or buy roots of rhythm you will not be sorry however stay away from o.c stiggs at all costs
