okay so it's kind of a stock movie story with stock characters but what really makes it a view-more-than-once flick are the characters especially benicio del torro who puts in another stellar performance del torro's character vincent was the only non-stock character in the film and i'm convinced that del torro made vincent all that he was no matter how good the writing directing i never get tired of christopher walken and his christopher-walkenisms so i found him bonus in the flick and who is this superb gangster nicholas turturro stick again a so totally stereotypical character but turturro's seamless peerless delivery made me perk up in anticipation of how he would deliver his next line every time he showed up in a scene br br something else i loved about this film were the tight images i think the quality of the air in coastal washington gave the film a solid high resolution look but things like the car storage facilities not being your ordinary chop shop garages contributed to that tight imaging even having the cars covered in plastic was a tight consideration as much as i'm not a big alicia silverstone fan her face extrapolated this tightness br br a serious detriment to the movie was the terrible weakness implausibility of everything to do with the police their acting their entire investigation activities the chase scene their placid acceptance of uncle ray at the final abduction site so strike that stuff from your memory and focus on del torro's acting thankfully the cops don't impinge much on the story br br overall i found this to be a very enjoyable film that i will definitely watch again
