this is a prequel which actually works and explains things rather than giving even more questions you can argue weather the mystery of sadako is better left untouched but the fact still remains this is a good movie br br the lead yukie nakama as a shy sadako is very good even though it's obvious she's a japanese version of carrie white misunderstood creepy and with gifts she never wanted that's the only real problem with this movie the original ring movie was just that original this movie however get's inspiration from other sources such as carrie and that removes some of it's power br br while it's not as moody as ring ring 0 still has some very good horror scenes and some smart camera-work seeing a white shape just at the edge of the screen is much more effective than for example the killer's pov br br as with ring this is a bit slow but builds up to a good finale there are no special effects really and it's very down-to-earth one of the qualities of this and ring br br finally there's the fact that it's japanese there's something refreshing about seeing a movie in a different language in different environments in a different culture br br i recommend this movie to those who liked ring it's definitely a worthy prequel 7/10
