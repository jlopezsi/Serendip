i was fortunate enough to catch just write on starz last night and was greatly pleased and surprised with this film i found all of the main characters to be very likable and also found the writing to be stellar at worst the film has inspired me to the extent that i just ordered three screenwriting books off of amazon.com when a movie has the power to make a person feel something strong or inspire them to the point that they will do something about their inspiration then it must be a great film and just write is
