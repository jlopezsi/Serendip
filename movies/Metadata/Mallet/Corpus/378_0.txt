it really makes me mad to see fellow canadians praising such a dumb movie especially when its as horrible as this i don't think ive ever seen another movie horror or otherwise where absolutely nothing happens for so long like the amount of boredom in this movie is actually unsettling the entire movie is filler right from the get go 45 minutes in and still nothing just pointless conversation that im guessing was supposed to be the character development we get a girl brooding into the mirror trying to conceal her secret but yeah thats about it for 45 minutes then we get a 3 minute chase scene then revert to 30 more minutes of nothing end of movie br br acting/budget are never a factor in horror so i wont comment on them usually plot holes and such shouldn't be a factor but there's just so much lameness with the whole rehab clinic and so many im so sure moments they'll be constantly on your mind agitating you since chances are nothing will be happening on screen an anti-climatic ending no scares no jumps no gore no laughs nothing not a single fun scene in the whole movie br br seriously if you want a horror with developed characters pulled off right and with stuff actually happening go rent the remarkable pumpkinhead and avoid this straight to video nonsense one of the most wildly inept horror/thriller flicks that ive seen in recent memory and believe me ive seen them all
