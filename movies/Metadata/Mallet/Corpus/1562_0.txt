made in 1985 when the whole world lived under the shadow of the bomb and the cold war looked like it would never end its quite ironic that this film and others before it echoed the fears of the whole planet but not long after its release the political climate started to change and it seemed the threat of nuclear war would finally be gone br br starting on april 1st 1986 no its not a joke in fact not only is it not a joke its the day the world ends with nukes aplenty going off fast forward 15 years from that nightmare to april 1st 2001 and we are introduced to a couple of people living underground who survived the bombs br br mainly the story is about phillip and marlowe however that pun is intended as they are 2 guys who dreamt of become private investigators so its a post apocalyptic film noir it's so noir the movie even starts in black white but it immediately changes to colour once the guys leave their shelter and drive into the outside world br br i knew i recognised the face of phillip john stockwell and it was because i remembered him playing the role of best friend dennis in the horror movie christine the guy playing marlowe michael dudikoff appears to be the worlds greatest bit part actor having been in nothing of any importance br br the helpful trawl tells you the guys are phillip hammer and marlowe chandler ignore how their billed in imdb.com its wrong and they'd grown up in a shelter full of 40's memorabilia and sleazy detective novels hence the stupid noir style names br br we also learn about a power struggle over 2 keys that could fire the last nuke left on earth the pi's rescue a damsel in distress who also happens to have one of those keys from some mutants and agree to get her to the closest phonebooth like the telephone infrastructure will have survived ww3 or been rebuilt in 15 years but as those mutants are dealt with by some unseen force it appears the damsel may have both of the keys we discover her name is miles archer isn't miles a mans name and a radio bulletin lets us know she was being chased by criminals br br she makes her phone call and bails on her rescuers having seen something that scared her but not before robbing marlowe and dropping the keys in their car the film then pretty much degrades into mad max meets the keystone cops and pretty much stays there the guys discover the keys and the name on the case that contains them is dash hammer phillips father so they set off to discover if he is alive or not br br after a bizarre encounter with disco mutants a girl called rusty mars they finally enter edge city the closest thing to civilization they walk around like a complete of complete rubes and you can tell they are going to either be constantly getting in or out of danger it appears rusty betrays phillip to sternwood the leader of a local gang for the keys and he is told he will be sold for meat as the residents of edge city are all cannibals br br there are a great deal of escapes rescues captures and betrayals to the point where it just gets plain annoying we have mutant sewer monsters and more disco mutants which get phillip and marlowe separated for no real good reason other than to allow marlowe a brief moment of glory as he rescues phillip from the disco mutants before they meet back up with miles who takes them back to her place br br phillip discovers a book on warhead arming launch codes and finally realizes exactly what the keys are for and why they are in such high demand his flashback to his childhood is extremely inaccurate as its a very well known fact that looking directly into a nuclear blast burns out your retinas so he should actually be blind br br setting off in 40's outfits that fit them perfectly stolen from the disco mutants thats what was inside the 2 packages they were carrying phillip marlowe sucker the gangs following them into a trap in the hope they will all kill each other in the confusion br br there's a nice twist about the identities of 2 of the mutant leaders which is followed by an extremely pointless battle scene why bother fighting for something you already have which ends up with the keys in miles possession there's an even more pointless mexican stand off and an unusual outcome with a very weak and incredibly open ending br br i assume it was left so open to allow a sequel if this had been any kind of success so judging from the lack of sequel it probably wasn't the film is pretty boring there are lots of periods of nothing happening interspersed with rapid paced action that doesn't last long then a bit of dialogue to following and the cycle continues from start to finish it's a pretty good example of how not to make a movie and its only real redeeming feature is its 80's soft rock sound track full of artists no-one has ever heard of
