i thought that the movie was dramatic with heart touching scenes br br i would like to see a sequel to this movie br br the ending does leave one to wonder what will happen to the invisible people br br also a story line could be built on the idea that tomme is now the chief br br a future sequel could show us how the tribe has thrived under the leadership of tomme br br this sequel could also show us tomme and kachiri and their family br br i would like to see tomme teaching his children about the traditions that were passed down to him from his adopted father wanadi
