the performance of ian mcshane was unequalled in any category of film or stage the fact that the emmy's ignored his great work is ludicrous if you haven't seen it buy the dvd when it's released and i'll guarantee that you'll love every single moment this show kicks the soprano's to the curb even if you don't like westerns per se this show will engross you every character is unique in their performance david milch has actually outdone himself here if the language and violence are not your cup of tea then it would be best to stay away otherwise the show is one of the best productions in years magnificent
