forget the awful series forget the even worse hollywood remake the assassin remember luc besson's la femme nikita br br this has got to be one of the most stylish moody and gripping films in existence luc besson's direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning particuarly the scene in the hotel where nikita gets her first assignment the soundtrack by eric serra is simply genius and actually adds something to the film soundtracks usually seem to be an afterthought but refreshingly not in this case br br the beautiful anne parillaud is perfect in the lead role unlike bridget fonda and the subtle romance between her and tcheky karyo is pure eloquence the hugely talented jean-hughes anglade of betty blue fame shines in this film but of all the male roles jean reno also fabulous in luc besson's leon)is outstanding as the completely unbalanced victor the cleaner jeanne moreau as amande makes a notable appearence following years of contributions in countless films br br luc besson established himself as one of the leading innovative directors with this film and you can easily see why this movie certainly rates among the top 10 films of all time br br i could pontificate about this film all day and all night but the best thing is for you to watch it yourself as a matter of priority it is a must see br br i'm off now to pursue a career in international assassinations
