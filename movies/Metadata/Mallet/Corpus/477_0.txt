the people who have written here to complain about this show's plot obviously don't understand what the blue's brothers movies are about they are in good company though when the second blue's brothers came out the spice girl's movie was also in theaters i was amazed to see how many reviewers panned the blue's brothers and gave half-decent reviews to the spice girl's dreadful exercise in film making the blue's brothers is all about the blues and i feel sad for those reviewers who can't appreciate the quality of the music and musicians showcased in this excellent and entertaining movie there are so many goose-bump inspiring vocal and instrumental performances by some of north america's most legendary musicians the dancing is good too the car crash is fun there are some great lines i think there is a serious side to this movie though and it is summed up neatly in elwood's inspirational speech when he reminds his rebellious band members what society will be left with if real musicians give up making music i think that if you read a review by someone complaining about the plot you should quit reading right away because that person who probably never ventures beyond the top 10 in his musical tastes obviously missed the whole point of this movie
