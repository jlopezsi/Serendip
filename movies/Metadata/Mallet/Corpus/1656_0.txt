autumn born marked dorothy stratten's first movie role in a career that would only last about a year until her untimely death at age 20 in 1980 the movie is a canadian exploitation flick and to say that it is technically awful is a real understatement after a few very dated late-1970s disco and office scenes dorothy's character is kidnapped and sent to a strict school of discipline at a country estate her captors throw her into a basement tie her up strip her naked torment torture and humiliate her for the rest of the movie all of these scenes appear to be lit by a single dim light bulb hanging from the basement ceiling at the end she turns the tables on her tormentors and wins the day br br it's hard to say exactly what the worst thing about this film is the photography is bad the acting is bad the sound quality is bad the lighting is bad the script is bad in particular the direction is hopelessly incompetent however there's something compelling about dorothy stratten's mere presence that makes this otherwise forgettable movie worth a look some people have said that stratten had that indefinable characteristic called star quality if so what might she have accomplished in the past 27 years
