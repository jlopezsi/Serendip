i was taken back the first moments of the movie i do not agree with this type of family arrangement however robin williams and nathan lane are such fantastic actors and comedians i couldn't help but get into this movie the movie has no boring moments it is all about the antics of the gay couple trying to come up with a plan to appear straight to a family with a totally different agenda br br i have watched this movie numerous times i have the video tape and the dvd every time it appears on television i have to watch just when i think my family gets a little too crazy i always have the birdcage to assure me all is well br br i am a registered nurse and currently completing my bachelor's degree in nursing i have chosen this movie to write a research paper about families after i complete the paper i will post another comment
