i sat down in front of my tv and turned to hbo and the man happened to be starting at that moment i needed two hours to pass so i watched it br br i was pleasantly surprised the idea to put eugene levy and sam jackson in a movie together was a clever one they bounce off each other perfectly the jokes in the movie range from farting humor to eugene levy explaining that the human bite is very painful which i found funny i found the film to be above average funny br br the film's humor and suspense are abundant enough to keep you watching the whole 83 minutes it is definitely a great movie to watch just to burn time br br 7/10
