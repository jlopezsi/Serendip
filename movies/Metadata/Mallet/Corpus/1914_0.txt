this is one of my all-time favorite altman movies even though i was too young to have ever seen the o.c stiggs saga in national lampoon i've been through two vhs copies of the movie dare i even hope that one day it might be available on dvd i think hell would have to freeze over first i had the chance to meet daniel jenkins about 12 years ago when he did a local production of twelfth night man is this guy talented i can't even remember how many different musical instruments this actor can play i think my friend and i scared him a bit as we barraged him with ridiculous queries about o.c stiggs at a question and answer session after the play he's a teenage crush that has carried over for many many years
