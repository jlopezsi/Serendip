this is a nice easygoing film the storyline is familiar to anyone who's acquainted with romantic comedies though this film really isn't the comedic type actually br br anyway the plot is very simple and nothing extraordinary and there are too many montage scenes where you get the feeling that the film is trying to substitute songs for the lack of action in plot also it is rather formulaic particularly in the middle of the film the whole misunderstanding part is so cliched br br however it's pleasant it still makes for a worthwhile watch on tv and predictably of course the best moment is when they finally are together after all that scene does make up a little for the flaws i grumbled about earlier though definitely not entirely because br br 1 the dialogue leading up to the kiss is very romantic 2 the kiss itself 3 i'm in love with the instrumental music in that scene br br so you get the idea it's up to your taste
