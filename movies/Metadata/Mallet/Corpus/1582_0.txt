bette davis stars as julie a southern belle in the antebellum south this movie predates the famed gone with the wind and in many ways outdoes it having more to offer namely the incomparable bette davis br br julie is so much more than a pouting prissy southern belle she does what she wants when she wants she doesn't care what others think about it whether it's wearing a red dress to a ball while others consider that taboo or sitting out on the porch with the slaves singing spirituals br br she was a feminist before there was feminist a liberated woman before women's lib she was to strong to be quiet and genteel and her beauty lay in her strengths br br bette davis does a remarkable job of portraying this character going from a catty to strong willed to kind hearted and self-sacrificing we see every facet of the brilliant diamond that is julie through davis superb acting br br the plot is gripping and realistic true to the historical nature of the antebellum era but it specifically deals with one woman's struggle to redeem herself against a reputation as a jezebel during an era where certain things were considered taboo and improper for a young lady of the south br br and yes i cry at the end but it's bittersweet tears
