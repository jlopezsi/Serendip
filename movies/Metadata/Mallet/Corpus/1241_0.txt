horrible is an apt description of this bomb of a movie actually it's insulting to all other movies just to call it a movie i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of time it's nothing but a ridiculous plot with bad acting and ludicrous scenarios a driver-less car flying off of cliffs only to return to torment us the viewers i presume no other cars on the road anywhere a 12-year-old kidnap victim is magically a stunt person with acrobatic skills please and in case you're waiting for an explanation of the plot in this drivel give up it never happens br br if this waste of time shows up on a channel in your area you'll have the perfect reason for throwing out your television
