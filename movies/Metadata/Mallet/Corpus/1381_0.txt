i tried to spoil my girlfriend who studies japanese culture with a film and it worked unagi the eal tells a story of man who commits a crime passionelle by murdering his wife when he leaves prison the guards bring him his eal under supervision of a local priest he tries to live a peaceful peasant-life in a place where nobody knows about his past he becomes a barber the eal is his friend they never say things you don't like the situation changes when on instigation of the priest a girl starts assisting him in his shop inevitable his dilemma's come back br br i loved this film for it reminded me much of the films of the dutch director/producer alex van warmerdam the ordinary tightly directed up to every detail the sufficating dilemma's lightly woven thru modern drama at it's best
