i love bad horror movies the crappier the better so that is why i love this movie it's right up there with bloodsucking babes from burbank or jackhammer massacre or killer klowns from outer space or even prehistoric bimbos in armageddon city you cant sit down to this movie and think its gonna be scarface or something you gotta sit down and think it's as bad as citizen kane but all in all it is a good movie with mindless killing and a killer clown the story is awesome it's like prom night or terror train or dead above ground its a revenge type movie were somebody dies and comes back to kill the kids of the people that killed him i quite enjoyed it and i cant wait for the squeal
