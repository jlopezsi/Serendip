ah yes i can remember not too long ago at that time one thing i would do each weekday was watch this classic soap opera from that moment on i was hooked on it in addition if you ask me marlena deidre hall really is diabolical you would have to have seen some of the things she's done if you want to know why i also enjoyed the days when eric jensen ackles was on the show ever since he left the show i haven't watched it as much you'd have to have seen the show between 1997 and 200 if you want to know why however this is still a good soap opera in conclusion i highly recommend this classic soap opera to all you die-hard nbc fans
