the eel tells a story about a japanese man who copes with his guilt after committing a crime i won't go into details on the crime that's for you to find out the way he does this is what makes this movie a great one in my book not only does he turn himself in after the crime with a great way of response by the police he even makes a friend out of an eel in prison hence the name of the movie once outside the prison he tries to build up a barber shop and get his life back on track br br the film is carried by its character interactions apart from these there is nothing else in this film so for those who don't like dialogue don't bother with this film because you'll be bored br br for the others who like a story carried by characters this surely is a must the only flaw for me was the presence of a quirky ufo nut but that's minor br br and please watch the original version with subs and not some gruesome dubbed version i never understood the appeal of a dub
