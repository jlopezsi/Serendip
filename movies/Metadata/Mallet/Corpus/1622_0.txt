before its announcement for dvd release as part of the fourth installment of warners the film noir collection where it was greeted with cheers of anticipation i have to admit that i wasn’t aware this particular title had that much of a reputation despite the director and star sterling hayden involved having watched it for myself i was duly impressed though i wouldn’t quite place it in the genre’s top ranks…but that’s because the standards set by the invigorating noir style during its heyday were so high br br incidentally despite the title which would seem to be hinting at a broader scale and its being produced by one of the hollywood majors warner bros the modest 74-minute duration pretty much relegated the piece to b-movie status furthermore the filming was reportedly completed in a mere fortnight interestingly it was the follow-up effort for the same studio by the team behind the gimmicky horror classic house of wax 1953 namely de toth producer bryan foy scriptwriter crane wilbur and co-stars phyllis kirk and charles bronson br br the plot followed a much-used noir formula the man whose past comes back to haunt him as an ex-con gene nelson is forced by three fugitives including bronson and ted de corsia after deliberately compromising his parole and threatening his wife into first harboring them and then take part in their proposed bank robbery by which time they’ve enrolled other dangerous elements to their fold notably a typically-nutty timothy carey the narrative then tries to cram in as many recognizably noir elements as it possibly can suspense violence romance location shooting documentary approach via a systematic police procedural etc br br for once too hayden is on the side of the law crime wave actually came roughly in between his two most famous noir roles in john huston’s the asphalt jungle 1950 and stanley kubrick’s the killing 1956 both of them classic heist films in which he had played the fated leader of a criminal gang though his character is just as cynical tough and uncompromising as ever in fact for the longest time he seemed merely a toothpick-chewing thick-headed bully here but eventually he gets to show his essential softness in the film’s beautifully-handled unusually hopeful for the genre finale br br de toth operated in most genres albeit tending towards action-oriented fare despite his being blind in one eye and whether adopting monochrome or color stock the full-frame ratio or the widescreen he could always be depended upon to deliver an efficient unpretentious stylish and entertaining product
