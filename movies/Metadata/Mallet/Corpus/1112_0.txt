this seemed like a good idea making a documentary by finding musicians and taping the truth about how they really feel br br but who'll care which musicians would make an impact regarding the theme of this film what would strike a chord with folks who really want to know the answers to this question well if you're waiting for an answer still wait 1970's after school specials plus actress rosanna arquette has combed new york mainly and found 80 of the musicians/singers/songwriters that folks almost have forgotten about and asked them for their thoughts musicans and yoko ono br br this could have and would have been interesting if there were a great deal of people we'd be interested in hearing deep inner most thoughts about the industry from from many sides of the spectrum but this was like looking at the walking dead on celluloid and the questions well i wont be looking for a rosanna arquette talk show anytime soon at least i pray there wont be any br br this is something you can readily expect to see on vh-1 under one of their cheesy shows but this would be best called behind the music with the cryptkeeper this is not to say rosanna and her crew should have found only young popular musicians and asked them they probably wouldn't know how to answer that question at this point in their quest for bling which is why at this point it may have been better to go to the near dead to talk about it their careers are done and they would have nothing to loose whereas younger musicians still have commercial appeal and they wouldn't want to eat and spit in the same place br br but many of the people in this effort made me cringe i saw the sickle behind many of them and felt this was their last chance to say something about the industry that they worked in on film before charon came for them to take them down the river styx br br of course i have to have half a brain here and think that those filmed wanted to be filmed and gave permission to be included in this documentary this could be one of the reasons why we sat through an overblown overlong episode of the dry and the dusty in the music industry with a few new folks sprinkled in and the few obligatory african americans for this to look like a diverse event if rosanna arquette didn't have an actress resume and the notorious toto song rosanna behind her this documentary would have been laughed off the face of this earth by any other filmmaker br br plus i always cringe when they drag out yoko ono to talk about music i missed the beatles years but thanks to other documentaries films tv show appearances etc etc etc being rammed down your throat about them at every turn there isn't much one can't know about them i understand that ms ono is/was an artist atrist a buzz word i will define in my opinion as a pretentious faux-intellectual pacific rim type entities purposely scoping for burnt out/drugged out has-been musicians/producers/songwriters types to feed into an overblown ego when others wont just to finance their visions so they can sit at home and not ever get a real job and her musings on music to me are about as helpful as an ant walking on an elephant's back i'm glad ms arquette the actress got to interview her because only an actress can say it is a honor to meet you to yoko ono i would suspect to ms arquette it would be an honor for her to meet and talk about music to mickey mouse too br br many folks 60 years old and older may want watch this because many of these musicians interviewed are musicians/singers/songwriters that generation grew up with and may want to know how they're doing these days be surprised they're still alive may want to know how they felt about working in the industry in their day and how their kids turned out when they weren't even home to see them grow up ms arquette gushing over them is always a plus for an ego booster and we know these folks need an ego booster in their final days br br there are a few a few mind you people interviewed by ms arquette that might appeal to those between 35 and 49 but none that would draw in the under 34 crowed unless they were studying music theory and wanted to do an extra credit paper in oldies pop br br if you want to see 80 the dry and the dusty in the music industry on the east coast and yoko ono and want to know their thoughts as interviewed by a fading actress another thinly veiled theme of this documentary to me really then this may be the film for you br br for others please don't bother
