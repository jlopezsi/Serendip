this movie is one of the best robin williams and nathan lane are phenomenal and hilarious but the best performance throughout the film is by hank azaria as agador the adorable flaming butler my favorite scene is when both families are sitting together eating dinner i don't want to give anything away but wow i was in tears gene hackman is extremely funny as a conservative senator this film is colorful unique and will keep an audience roaring with laughter yes the movie follows some typical stereo types among a gay male couple however is not offensive in anyway shape or form i think this is such a cute film and if you haven't seen it or if you happen to be in the mood for a laugh out loud movie rent the birdcage br br my rating 9/10
