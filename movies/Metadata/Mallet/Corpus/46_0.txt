this film has got merit not least the photography it is beautifully shot and the location has much to admire there is a touch of john ford in parts its main strength is the performance by jack palance anthony perkins is ok but he has not a lot to do small parts by familiar actors adds to the attractions of the film which is well worth a viewing one of my childhood best loved films which i was not disappointed with when i watched it recently
