having only been previously exposed to albert pyun's 90s-era direct-to-video low-budget action garbage i picked up radioactive dream expecting a futuristic crapfest like nemesis or omega doom i was surprised to discover this movie is not only original but extremely funny and entertaining br br michael dudikoff in an effectively humorous role the same year he kicked off his b-action career with american ninja and john stockwell christine my science project and now a director of motion pictures play marlowe chandler and phillip hammer a couple of real dicks having been raised on 50s pulp detective novels hence their names while confined to an underground bomb shelter they emerge 15 years after a nuclear war has turned the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland all these guys want is dames and to become the world's biggest private dicks the first person they meet is a revolutionary rebel by the name of miles archer lisa blount who i also remember from another of my favorite guilty-pleasure 80s flicks nightflyers as well as blind fury and prince of darkness purely by accident our two heroes end up in possession of the two keys that can launch the last nuclear missile in existence and when this fact is discovered after they reach the last outpost of civilization edge city they find themselves on the run from every mutant gang in town br br this movie's pluses include a colorful variety of characters many based on specific stereotypes from different eras pulp detectives disco mutants greasers as well as cannibals and giant rats general goofiness in both the action sequences and the heroes trying to get acquainted to the changed world a most excellent 80s soundtrack and george kennedy to boot as expected the movie is a comedic satire for most of the first hour but then suddenly turns serious in the last 20 minutes but this movie does end with the coolest two-man song and dance number ever br br in short don't let the pyun credit fool you radioactive dreams is a good rental for those who wish to see something completely different especially suggest a double billing of this with six-string samurai 7/10
