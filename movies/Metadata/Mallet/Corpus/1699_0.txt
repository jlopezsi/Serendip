i'd have to say that this is easily my favorite movie of all time it's a terrific parody of the inner workings of hollywood and it's backed up my absolutely amazing animation and special effects by mr jittlov who also does a wonderful job as the main character himself and the police dog the producer does a good job acting as the producer as he should br br summary see it you'll like it i promise
