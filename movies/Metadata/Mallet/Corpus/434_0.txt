the xtro-trilogy if you can call it that is an odd phenomenon the three movies are totally unrelated except for the fact that they all were directed by harry bromley davenport and they all deal with extra-terrestrial encounters the first xtro was a peculiar little sci-fi/horror/drama-gem a weird mixture of genres but a good flick nonetheless xtro ii the second encounter was a shameless alien rip-off solid in creature-terror but over-all bad and xtro 3 watch the skies unfolds more like a 90 minutes episode of the x-files mixed with military stuff and ripped details from predator so go figure br br now xtro 3 is slightly better than the second one only because it actually has a bit of a plot it has also another rather unique aspect it's a sort of alien-revenge-flick there aren't many of those are there a group of expendable military misfits are send out to clean up a remote island for the military has plans to build a base there soon they discover that there's actually an all different purpose to their visit as they encounter an alien on that island br br the actors are unknown mediocre and the characters are all clich√©s except for andrew"djinn"divoff it's nice to see him again but his performance is rather unnoticeable and you get the idea that he's only any good when he can deliver witty one-liners the camera-work is pretty bad too the musical score is at times really cheap but sometimes they surprisingly use the right scary sounds but it was at those moments that i suspected they used parts from other movie's soundtracks br br as for the alien effects they're pretty good especially the moving facial features there are some decent gore-effects too but the rest of the special effects look crappy br br at times you will have to fight off boredom while watching this flick but the occasional voice-over from the main character makes you want to know how it all will end so if your looking for an off-beat sci-fi quicky xtro 3 might be worth a watch more demanding sci-fi fans should better ignore it
