i really liked this movie it shows you more in depth on the enemy the villain i actually felt sorry for sadako the actress is really really pretty br br i believe compared to the other two movies of this japanese trilogy ring 0 is by far the best it shows you how sadako came to be the girl in the well the girl on tv br br sadako is a teenager how when she kills as a little girl doesn't make sense it will if you watch it she is in an acting troupe to get away from her problems she witnesses love fear br br you get to see the real side of her see how unfair sadako really was treated br br please watch this movie it will do you good a good change compared to all that other craptacular american horror flicks that are really comedies br br this movie will make you think touch your heart
