i have seen this film so many times and never get sick of it the casting is brilliant with dan futterman and stuart townsend in fantastic performances br br the plot is quite original following dylan and jez two english con artists who are tricking people out of their money by selling voice recognition computers and other false devices they need two million dollars to buy the house they never had having grown up as orphaned children on one of their scams they employ a secretary and medical student named georgie who is convinced they are raising money for an orphans project this adds romantic themes into the story to make it even more entertaining a stand out is the interesting relationship that dylan and jez have with each other dylan being the fast talking american and jez being the british techno genius br br i recommend shooting fish to all movie-goers it has a great soundtrack is funny romantic creative and a great achievement for british filmmaking
