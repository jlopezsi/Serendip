this is a very generic scifi-thriller with very little originality to it br br we've seen this type of thriller before can anyone say invasion of the bodysnatchers that one is also a lot better made even the very lame remakes are superior to this dung br br essentially it's a communist rehash who can you trust who's to not be trusted br br the movie is like the 50's and 60's but with aliens attaching themselves to your back instead of some sneaky russian br br there are so many elements that are borrowed from other borrower-movies pun intended that this becomes a very mediocre mess the cheesy way of noticing non-humans was the first thing that made me roll my eyes also funny how the puppets are quite human in the beginning of the movie and then towards the end are really robotic br br well not to give too much away but this is really lowbudget action-scifi it's not scary and it's done in a very generic way the cheesy plot-twist at the end was what really killed any originality imho
