final fantasy viii was regarded as flawed by many final fantasy fans upon release the truth is they were too busy re-playing final fantasy vii to realise exactly what had just be created br br final fantasy viii is not only my favourite game of all time it's probably the best to try and explain it right now is very hard not because of a complex plot or difficult scenario but because whatever i say will not compare to how much of a masterpiece it really is br br i will however point out some finer points the characters are the most in-depth perfect and different individuals you will ever meet in a video game they're so developed they seem real they interact with each other based on their feelings and you never for a minute feel like they're video game characters best of all they're likable to a point in which you wish you were part of their gang i cannot express my true thoughts on how much i worship the characters of final fantasy viii it would be impossible for me to comprehend br br the music is an absolute masterpiece it's perfect and beautifully crafted i purchased the soundtrack and i listen to it on shuffle everyday for a few hours it always suits the scene or setting or builds up tension suspense or just plain excitement it's awesome br br the plot is not basic it's complex it's amazing it's definitely un-flawed and people are now starting to realise exactly what's so good about the 8th chapter in the final fantasy saga br br if you could have one game to play forever i strongly recommend this it's my choice and i complete it at least 3 times a year to ensure i never forget about it although that's not very likely br br overall the greatest game of all time without a doubt a definitive gaming masterpiece for ff fans alike pure perfection 10/10
