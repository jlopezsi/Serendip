is this movie slow occasionally boring kind of depressing yes unfortunately that is the reality of working as a temp in an office take it from one who's been there i spent several years temping on breaks from college in the late 80s and this movie brought it all back vividly the office politics the way the permanent workers look down on the temps the menial and mind-numbing tasks the good old boys mostly white males at that time who were in charge and above it all not all of my jobs were as horrible as the office depicted in this movie but enough were that it occasionally gave me chills i hope that things have improved with the proliferation of computers and other advanced technology at least in terms of the work itself but i can guarantee that in some places that temp vs perm caste system will always be there regardless of how the jobs get done br br the performances in the movie were excellent i really liked parker posey's exuberant portrayal as well as toni collette's studied more subtle effort she expresses so much pain and frustration through her facial expressions and quiet even-toned narration br br the movie is not for everyone and some viewers will no doubt be bored and/or confused by it but if you've ever been a temp of any kind or worked in an office i think it will resonate with you
