i agree totally with the others fire sale is one of the funniest comedies ever made br br i have not read maltin's review but if it is negative the man is suspect br br as for the few who were extremely critical of the movie i'm speechless how could one not love this film it is one side-splitting scene after another it is nigh impossible to summarize it one has to experience it further more it is jewish comedy at its very best they don't make films like this anymore br br like the others i have searched for this film in nearly 25 years i would welcome contact from anyone who can help me find a copy
