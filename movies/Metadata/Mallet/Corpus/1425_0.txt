la battaglia dell'ultimo panzer is about a german panzer crew caught behind the american lines in france in 1944 the production values of the movie are very low the anachronisms and errors concerning equipment and uniforms are actually quite obvious nevertheless the plot is quite intelligent this is a surprisingly serious war movie and much more reflective than most ww ii war movies of the period such as where eagles dare or kelly's heroes or the countless italian rip-offs of these more lighthearted war thrillers br br this is mainly because the characters and in particular the german soldiers are more than just the kind of cardboard cliches one expects from this type of low-budget movie especially the main character a german lieutenant and commander of the crew played by stelvio rosi is a surprisingly three dimensional character while he presents himself as a hardline nazi believer at first we later see that the horrors of war affect him deeply in an unexpected moment and the final scenes of the movie have a very bitter lesson in store for him civilians and their different ways of dealing with the occupation also have a place giving some surprising nuances which most war movies including the technically infinitely superior but plot-wise arguably inferior saving private ryan lack br br the acting is middle-of the road none of the quite unknown actors are really bad but none really stands out 8/10 for some of the writing 2/10 for the production values
