this demented one-of-a-kind comedy works best if you've seen 4 or 5 noir/hard boiled detective movies because at that point you begin to notice the plots become conflated and entangled the gag is that with a bit of thought you can splice 20 of them together and get something pretty similar the resulting mystery and detection results in a story that doesn't make a whole lot of sense but then lots of noirs don't make much sense the big sleep somewhere in the night dark passage for noir the tone the striking compositions and the moral code are much more important br br whoever pieced this together had a lot of fun with it there's quite a range of different comedy to enjoy some of the funniest bits just involve the new footage martin's bleeding knees some of them are absurd/revisionist rachel ward can hear martin's voice-over narration a whole lot of them involve the absurd plot lines introduced by the old footage that then have to be integrated some running jokes are duds adjusting your breasts bogart and his ties others are awfully funny that's never gonna heal it also has some hysterical visuals martin's balletic dodge of alan ladd's bullet some of the patches are funny martin is constantly correcting people when they get his name wrong because they're talking to other characters in other films the two best comic moments involve a unique way to make coffee and martin's hopeless post-rejection assessment of women all of this is ten floors above the usual adam sandler dross br br if an academic ever gave this its due as the first instance of meta or at least an example of intertextuality it would have more respect if you've seen it more than once it's interesting to see why not just plot points but visuals have to be introduced sometimes quite smoothly i.e martin gets drugged and offers to put on his pajama top over his suit because it's needed to match the schmo he's doubling in the next vintage clip too funny you don't need to think hard at all to enjoy this but if you like thoughtful movies this offers a bonus level to consider br br on the minus side reni santoni is irritating and certifiably untalented he doesn't deliver a single laugh
