i wasnt sure what to expect from this movie because i knew it combined my favourite actor de niro's stongest(gangster roll and weakest comedy)acting aspects in one film any worries i had soon were dispelled because i loved the film crystal and de niro worked like a comedy duo that had been together for years the story is of a gangster who starts to have emotional problems and panic attacks due to the death of his father 35 years ago.the ensuing antics result in a very funny and action packed cracker of a film dont miss it 9 out of 10
