bela lugosi so often underrated as a performer even though he played none other than jesus christ on stage to some acclaim manages here to convey a sense of loss that is almost palpable no doubt about it but that this is one of his finest performances karloff is very creepy as the devil-worshipping madman whose cold concrete bauhaus sits atop the site of a bloody battle it even overlooks a field of crude grave markers his almost effeminate makeup and mannerisms further his creepiness his black gown hangs like a dress on him and he often gestures with wrist limp the tour de force is of course the pheasants under glass tour he gives the long-suffering lugosi it's a scene that still packs a wallop and in its own way lends lugosi's later flaying alive of karloff a sense of wrongs being righted absolutely must-see movie-making from a director who rarely had the means to reach such ends
