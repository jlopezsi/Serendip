this movie is a must see for any fan of tonkatsu reflective to real life style cinema as well as science-fiction/action comparitively this movie is an unsung classic in tonkatsu it has such compelling elements similar to work from kurosawa's ran and rashomon as some would complain that this film is not a visual masterpiece i would in turn ask them how much of it they have seen there are very dynamic characters and excellent plot formation and culmination the storyline is a very insightful view on humanity and socio-economic divisions and struggles therein while touching these points and making an impact at doing so the movie's elements of action and drama are of such quality that anyone can enjoy the film without struggling to get it's deeper meaning missing this film is an injustice to anyone who enjoys science-fiction action drama and intriguing storyline enjoy this excellent film
