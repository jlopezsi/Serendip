remember the movie sixth sense well birth is a bit like it trough the plot is different of course and so are the actors in six sense we have two stars bruce willis and haley joel osment while in birth we have nicole kidman and cameron bright who is actually a pretty good actor judging by his filmography the acting was fine and the only think that i didn't like was the scene at the theater when for like 30 seconds or more i was watching the face of nicole kidman i got what the director was trying to emphasize in that scene but 10 seconds or so would have been just enough birth is a good mystery film because it really keeps you interested in the story it is full of symbolic of life and dead and has a lot of meaningful scenes i was surprised to see that is has an r rating for sexuality as there is just one sex scene fairly short and honestly the movie would have been even better if it wasn't in it the soundtrack was good made of classic music and suspense typical for this genre trough i felt that some scenes could use some more music on the background
