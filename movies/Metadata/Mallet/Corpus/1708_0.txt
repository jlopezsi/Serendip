this film is magic at its best pure and simple as such it's not for everyone people who don't like silliness or weirdness will probably find it dull or worse but anyone who believes in magic who wants to see wonders unfold before their eyes and who can be silly for the duration of the film will find it an absolute treat br br the wizard mike jittlov whisks us into his fantasy world almost immediately and it's a roller-coaster of cheesy but fun jokes and truly astounding and heart-felt fx that speak to the child in each of us br br the sheer kinetic energy of this thing makes you feel like you could fly or run on air anyway rumors are that sam raimi/bruce campbell actually asked mike jittlov to visit them to preview a little film they'd thrown together called evil dead because they wanted someone who they respected to give the thumbs up to their movie before it debuted dreamers rejoice in the chaotic joy that is the wizard of speed and time
