the only thing that i can think when reading the negative comments left for this movie is that the people who wrote them have clearly never temped as someone who spent four years of his life wasting away in other people's cubicles i can tell you with complete authority that this movie gets every mind-numbing insulting and degrading aspect of the experience dead on i suppose you should be thankful if you can't relate to what's going on in this film because it probably means you've never had to tip-toe into some middle manager's office on a friday afternoon to get a signature on your time card br br as for those who think clockwatchers is dull or boring it's called subtly look into it
