the wizard of speed and time is a low-budget movie loosely based on the trivial adventures of a special effects person jitlov who is making a short movie i sought out this movie after reading many glowing reviews on imdb despite wanting to like it i found the hype to be unfounded br br dated music and visuals along with cheesy humor screams out 80's movie inexpensive early synthesizers in simplistic arrangements were used for a large part of the music for visuals somewhat crude stop-motion photography is the order of the day never do you finish a scene without having to digest the awkward and unnatural effects even keeping in mind that this is a low budget movie we never cross over into cherishing the effects for what they are and instead lose whatever redeeming value they could have otherwise had br br as a fan of airplane i enjoy low-brow humor unfortunately wizard is not nearly in the same league puns sometimes replaced any real attempt at adding any substantial humor scenes showing jitlov's dealings with various unions complete with double-talk representatives left me cold despite their humorous target the various flat-lined police scenes often involving mock-chase scenes produced groans instead of laughs in other parts clever visuals took the place of real humor often a small effect for instance glasses that glowed at the right moment inspired a smile unfortunately cute effects can't bridge over the large gaps in humor this movie has and wizard never goes beyond a level that only pre-teen audiences can enjoy br br wizard contains jitlov's running commentary on hollywood unions jitlov reduces the movie industry to a two-dimensional caricature of evil and incompetence in one case a movie producer ambushes jitlov's efforts at every turn in order to win a bet wizard is also laced with running themes about hollywood union lock-down for example studio executives use creative accounting to allow the non-union jitlov to make his short while remaining out of union sight this potentially political statement lacks the bite it needed to come across as anything but fluff instead it becomes lost in the mix br br script limitations left the actors out in the cold philip michael thomas miami vice played a bit-part policeman that had no significant role in the plot other than to chase some conveniently placed bad guys his character ends up slapped on top of a script held together by loosely-based vignettes stephen stucker who nearly stole the show in airplane had even less screen time his last screen appearance stucker's comic talents unfortunately are never allowed to surface in the end jitlov spends too much time in front of the screen with his only adequit acting skills br br some have made much of the movie showing behind-the-scenes glimpses of how special effects are done nobody is going to walk away from wizard a special effects expert while wizard held a few moments of interest notably the running on the wall effect most everything fell into simple common sense br br in conclusion this isn't the diamond in the rough that some have suggested i wanted to like wizard but the many flaws quickly grew tedious if you do come across it take a look just don't get your hopes too high
