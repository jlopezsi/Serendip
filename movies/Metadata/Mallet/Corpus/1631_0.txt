and we fans of film noir prize nastiness and cold-heartedness we also like small movies br br gene nelson is very affecting as a parolee who is dragged into a crime against his will phyllis kirk is fine as his wife she doesn't add much flavor but she's believably loyal br br for flavor we have none other than timothy carey he is one of the bad guys charles bronson early in his career is another carey adds a great deal of creepiness to the goings-on br br sterling hayden is excellent as the cynical cop who's called in though the plot tells us nothing about him other than that he's given up smoking and misses it he is clearly not a warm human being his eyes squint and shift he doesn't trust anyone and it's very possible he doesn't like much of anyone either br br the movie begins with dub taylor as an exceptionally goofy gas station attendant he's like a character from the ma and pa kettle series but our villains knock him out and rob him which is a jarring contrast br br the characters are very well drawn in crime wave it has a tough plot but the people are what elevates it to a high status
