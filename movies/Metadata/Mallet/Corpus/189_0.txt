this is a throwback there was a time when horror films were gritty exploitive funny nasty and had moments so bad they were good and boobs they showed boobs if you're not expecting devil's rejects or the grudge or any other modern and slick horror you will find wedding slashers watchable wedding slashers is a direct descendant of those trashy low budget 70s horror films catchy title cute girls nudity blood a big old knife on the artwork br br the movie opens with a flashback a bride and a groom with not a nickel to rub together are heading to vegas running away from home to get married they don't make it they are exterminated by a gas mask cloak wearing darth vader sounding killer he spouts some nonsense about love and then abruptly splits the brides head open like a watermelon you practically see the seeds moving forward in time we meet another bride every man she's every loved has died a mysterious death without ruining the end the fate of her fianc hangs in balance will the mystery be solved and will our love birds tie the knot before the bloody finale the plot is simple the performances are raw but more often than not good this production value is minimal the technical aspects besides a nice 5.1 surround mix there are none the gore is sometimes shocking sometimes campy and usually entertaining br br the charm in this is that a bunch of first timers at least their previous credits don't add up to much have made a little movie that pretty much works you can see the missteps but they are never boring or offensive i would have liked to see more of the strippers at the bachelor party of course it would have been nice to see more of the bride there's a shower scene and for some reason they don't show below her shoulders she's too cute to keep covered up but despite those major drawbacks wedding slashers is a keeper
