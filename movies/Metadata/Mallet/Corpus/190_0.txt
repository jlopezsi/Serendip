i watch a lot of horror movies and lately there really is no shortage of them to see but this was a horrible movie the blood and violence being the only thing that made it worth while the acting was beyond high school bad there were a couple scenes that you could tell the actors were just improving poorly and i never notice costumes but they were some of the worst i've ever seen it this movie googles and a face shield what the hell i never turn off a movie no matter how bad it is but i almost did for this one who ever has there name attached to this movie in any way should probably be lined up and shot br br but that's just my opinion
