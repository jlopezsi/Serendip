very good film from director wyler although it is its star bette davis upon whom its high quality mostly rests this is perhaps davis best performance that i've seen she plays a spoiled southern belle whose fianc henry fonda leaves her after a socially embarrassing event as he leaves her she swears that he will return as he has in the past and he does one year later with his new northern wife in tow the film does wonders with its historical setting new orleans a short while before the civil war a year before gone with the wind cooed over the fancy lives and manners of the ante bellum south jezebel was exploring them in more detail and with a more intelligent eye also lurking about is the threat of yellow fever which devastated new orleans in the 1830s and is starting to grow rampant again another thing i really liked about jezebel was its ending perhaps when it was released in 1938 there would be a feeling that davis character has turned a corner and has become more selfless but to me her motives seemed awfully suspicious that ambiguity is fascinating along with the leads donald crisp and george brent give fine supporting performances and max steiner's score is one of the best of its era 9/10
