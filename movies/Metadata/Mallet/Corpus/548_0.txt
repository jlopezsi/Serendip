i buy a lot of cheap movies none of them are usually any good but this one surprised me br br it is obvious that it had a low budget and the overall film making isn't very good but the ideas behind the story captured my interest the thoughts of undiscovered caves deep within the earth containing life really excites me if only this movie could be remade and altered a little on a much larger scale it could be one of my favourites br br this film was let down however by a low budget the set wasn't bad but the costumes were terrible the designs of the cavemen looked quite good the dark eyes pale skin and increased hearing are what you might imagine from a species who have evolved in a dark cave but i did not like those hairstyles that's the 80s for you the acting was poor and some of the characters were pointless the opening scenes introduced two of the main characters well but other then that it should have been explained what had been going on exactly br br every now and then i'm inspired by a story and want to write something myself along the same lines this had one of those inspiring stories i highly recommend watching this if you don't mind b movies
