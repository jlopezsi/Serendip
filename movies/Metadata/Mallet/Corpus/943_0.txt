this film has a promising first act br br after around 20 minutes you begin to suspect that things will go wrong br br then they get much worse than that they get terrible br br the third act is in slow-motion with nine too many plot twists and no pace at all by this time you are clawing the stuffing out of your couch br br i hate these people for having wasted a night out of my life br br dan futterman a kind of low-rent baby richard gere plays the american the english love to hate smug glib an updated version of over-paid over-sexed and over here br br stuart townsend plays a shambling english wonk good hearted and socially undeveloped hey there's something new in films br br kate beckinsale's charm is unable to salvage the proceedings and she projects none of the intelligence one would hope to find in a budding doctor totally implausible and there are some very good character actors who are completely wasted in unrewarding roles br br i suspect the script was written using one of those screen writing software programs as the characters twists and paradoxes are all arbitrary every single last blinking one of them including the blow-up dolls br br if the surgeon general's office could place a health warning on this film the world would be a safer place br br i can't imagine where the positive reviews for this film originate probably in a misplaced sense of charity as jay sherman of the critic would say it stinks
