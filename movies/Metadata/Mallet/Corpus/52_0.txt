i have been in search of childhood anime for awhile now this movie was at the top of my list i haven't watched it since i was very young i remember renting it over and over the story line is very interesting and playful i loved every character in the movie the pictures and the way the animation was drawn was one of my favorite things the score for the film gave me goosebumps even as a small child definitely a must for any anime fan i was overwhelmed with excitement when nausicaa of the valley of the wind came back into print on dvd this year maybe this movie will come back into print but i doubt it due to the risqu nature of the film and modern definition of g rated movies absolutely great movie hope i get to see it again soon
