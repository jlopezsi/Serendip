it goes without saying now but of course i will say that i and many others don't merely enjoy love are engrossed by adore are awestruck and stunned by etc etc etc the writing the directing the staging the performance the concept the amazing dialogue and soliloquies by al bullock jane doc farnum utter et al and on and on if you haven't seen deadwood i find it hard to believe that anyone who has come to this site hasn't you must br br the comparisons to shakespeare are accurate and deadwood is in the nature of that era's play cycles the spicy descriptive and even florid speech is accurate in its spirit as was shakespeare's in his day i am old enough to have had and been intimidated by at close quarters for many years a quite proper great-grandmother who lived and taught english on the frontier in nebraska in her case born 1867 died 1956 her and my genteel grandmother's and my refined mother's frequently used expletives included the likes of judas priest indicating that the most dire and terrifying consequences were impending other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity or were inspired by classical literature the bible and popular song and are now incomprehensible to us these have simply been translated for us where necessary or conveyed to us as is when they still make scatological sense today br br this could easily be one of if not the greatest accomplishment in modern american theatre it is theatrical and even in contemporary literature i predict the scripts and performances will be studied in future college-level english lit theatre/drama and humanities classes but deadwood will go out with a whimper flawed and disappointingly ended due to hbo's and milch's failure to see it through as projected and called-for by its very art br br though deadwood has become probably the greatest experiment note the ex in that word in tv it will unfortunately soon pass into the world of might have been without a satisfactory and worthy end as most of you likely know the sets have been struck and the cast and crew will not be returning at least as of this date for a fourth season as had been promised and anticipated in order to bring the cycle to an appropriate close while as a portrayal of a moment in time time and the world continue after the show ends no matter when that is the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe and that's a big maybe a 2-hour movie or maybe 2 2-hour movies sometime in the uncommitted future br br if you care please register your protest with hbo you might even look up save deadwood to see what's up enough from minuscule me just watch appreciate and try to save the incredible always amazing phenomenon and justly so that is deadwood please please please
