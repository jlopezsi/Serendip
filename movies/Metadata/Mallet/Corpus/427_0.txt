xtro was a pretty good albeit strange little cult horror movie xtro 2 had nothing to do with the original and is basically a derivative alien movie but was still reasonably fun for mindless entertainment xtro 3 has nothing to do with either xtro or xtro 2 which left itself open pretty nicely for a sequel i wish x-3 picked up where x-2 left off unfortunately xtro 3 is just flat-out terrible where to begin it's very slow we're about 30 minutes into the movie before there's any sign of aliens mayhem whatever when you do get to the aliens you're pretty disappointed because they are the dumbest looking aliens you'll ever see i realize they can become invisible and also have some other powers in their little alien bag of tricks but you take one look at them and you just feel like a group of military folks even ones like the misfits we so clearly have here ought to have been ransacked these aliens in and out of this secluded island in about 5 minutes if these aliens are so advanced how come they were stuck on this island for 40 years and there's other ridiculousness associated with this movie like when banta gets stuck in the aliens sticky web and the guys sit around for two days debating whether to go try to rescue her all while they can clearly see from afar that the aliens are trying to conduct experiments on her then one of them finally decides to shoot at them and from long range and hits banta and kills her instead banta was kind of hot so that's why i'm a little more outraged about this scene why not confront the aliens at close range anyway i'm not sure why i feel like this movie doesn't deserve the lowest rating maybe it's banta but i'm feeling somewhat generous so i'll give xtro 3 a 2 out of 10
