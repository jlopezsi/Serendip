this is not the most intellectually stimulating film ever made nor is it the most believable plot but it is funny whimsical and charming and occasionally surreal if you want a film to brighten up your life this fits the bill just nicely the supporting cast are also very engaging being far more than just a backdrop to moore and hannah i like it a lot
