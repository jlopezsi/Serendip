the last time unitel pictures released a film it was the award winning crying ladies which took in many awards during the metro manila filmfest of 2003 well the company has made a rather drastic change for it's next project in santa santita here we see a more dramatic film with a more serious storyline this time it is laurice guillen who is directing this movie br br my very first reaction when i found out that angelica panganiban was to star and given the plot i thought that she was miscast due to her age but to my surprise she is already 18 and therefore fit the profile it seemed only yesterday that she was playing kiddie roles and it was quite a shock to see her in such a mature role overall i think she did a good enough of a job there were times that she was found lacking but overall it was ok there were also some good performances from the other characters in the film however it seemed as if the other characters such as sister dolor seemed out of place or to a degree completely useless br br in terms of the storyline i was rather interested to see how events would play out given that this theme on faith healing and religion is a largely unexplored here in the country i thought the storyline was interesting enough i just wish they had emphasized more regarding the powers of the lead character as they only presented a few examples of such br br with guillen at the helm of the film you can expect that there would be a very strong aspect to the film that's certainly just what we got in the film
