i caught this on city tv last night feb 16th 2008 when flipping through the channels and even though i had missed the first 30 minutes of this film i was compelled to stop on that channel and watch it i found the plot to be riveting i couldn't turn away br br please be warned my review contains spoilers if you haven't seen the film yet please stop reading now br br i was drawn in by several factors the disintegration of julie henry's relationship the illness and impending death of their son the mystical magical healer character the ensuing relationship between julie alexei i was so fascinated by all of these concepts unraveling at once br br i kind of disliked how alexei abruptly left when he found he couldn't heal the boy it begged so many questions such as is it just that boy he cannot heal or has he totally lost his powers and what made him lose his powers giving in to his desire for sex love or did he lose his powers when he impregnated julie did his healing force leave his body through ejaculation br br also when the film cuts to the final scene where julie's pregnancy is obviously going along nicely and even though their son's death is imminent they appear to be a reunited happy family again nothing was shown to describe how the family got back to this state again it begged more questions such as when how did julie henry get so friendly with each other again and how did they let go of all of the bad feelings and bad blood between them and become so loving again and is the baby going to have alexei's healing powers br br but even though i seem to prefer a film that spells it all out for me i loved this film because it begged all of those questions because it left me pondering wondering thinking worrying it truly is a thought-provoking film and i love when i can watch a film and still be affected by it and still be thinking about it days later this film is definitely one of those films
