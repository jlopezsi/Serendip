what a ridiculous film this movie is so bad i can't believe i was daring enough to see it until the end but it was hard do you know when you start watching a movie and in the first 4/5 minutes you start asking yourself why doesn't it end right now yes that's right this film stunk from the very first minute br br the psycho character is ridiculous i mean what stupid clown suit is that br br the plot is pathetic one of the silliest i've seen the last times br br the acting is bad i know it's a b-series movie or is it a z-series one instead but the acting could be much better br br the special effects are lame i know it was a low cost production but even so br br the all main idea of using a clown and the fast-food setting is absurd ridiculousÂ…if it's supposed to be funny or spoofing it just spoofs itself br br fast food doesn't kill but this film does of boredom
