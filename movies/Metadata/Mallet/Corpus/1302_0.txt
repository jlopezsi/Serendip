i have often found myself defending albert pyun for some of his films that few other people like like nemesis but heatseeker a pretentious mix of pseudo-sci-fi and martial arts action really is one of his worst films keith cooke whom i first spotted in china o'brien 2 where he stole the show from cynthia rothrock and richard norton is an impressive kicker gary daniels is an excellent opponent and the cast is obviously full of real fighters if pyun had cut out all the crap about cyber enhancement and rival bio-engineering companies we would probably have about 30 minutes of straight fighting in other words the movie is watchable but only if you know how to use your fast-forward button
