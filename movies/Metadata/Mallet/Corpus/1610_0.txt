after winning the oscar for best actress in 1936 for dangerous bette davis began to complain that warner brothers was not giving her scripts that were worthy of her talent in 1936 warner suspended her without pay for turning down a role she then went to england in violation of her contract with the intention of starring in a movie without warner brothers approval the studio stopped her telling her that if she didn't work for them she wouldn't work anywhere in defiance she sued to break her contract although she lost the lawsuit warner brothers began to take her more seriously and even paid her legal expenses the part in jezebel was thought to be an olive leaf offered by the studio to mollify her br br about that time davis made it known that she wanted the lead in david o selznick's upcoming production of gone with the wind she was actually considered for the role but warner told selznick that they wouldn't agree to loan her out unless he also took errol flynn for the part of rhett butler davis refused to work with flynn and angrily turned down the part although selznick did not intend to agree to flynn regardless many believed that warner brothers purposely created an impossible deal to punish davis for the lawsuit while making it appear they were trying to help her it isn't clear whether jezebel was offered to her before or after the negotiations for gwtw clearly it didn't matter because bette davis went out and gave one of the best performances of her career and won her second oscar for best actress br br this film is gwtw without yankees instead the enemy is yellow fever the story takes place in new orleans in the 1850's although there are references to the abolitionists and the prospect of war the entire story takes place prewar this story focuses on the southern lifestyle of the period and in this way it is very similar to its more famous counterpart it also follows the life and times of one very spirited woman named julie marsden bette davis who could have been scarlet o'hara's soul mate br br julie shocks new orleans society when she insolently comes to a ball wearing a red dress when it is the custom for all proper southern girls to wear white a production note of interest the famous red dress was actually black satin which was used because red didn't produce enough contrast in the black and white film causing it not to stand out enough as a result her beau preston dillard a youthful henry fonda is mortified and he breaks off their engagement included in the story are a couple of duels over points of honor a stark depiction of the yellow fever epidemic and the noble resurrection of a contrite julie marsden upon preston's return br br as always director william wyler with whom bette davis was romantically linked does a fantastic job at direction giving the film a genuine southern flavor and period feel the black and white cinematography in this film is tremendous and procured the film one of its five oscar nominations br br the acting is superb all around this is certainly one of bette davis best and most memorable performances and it helped secure her place in movie history as one of hollywood's greatest stars though she never won another oscar she went on to be nominated eight more times with five straight nominations between 1939 and 1943 ironically in 1940 she lost to vivien leigh who won in the role davis turned down br br fay bainter is marvelous as aunt belle bogardus garnering a best supporting actress oscar henry fonda shows a hint of his future greatness in a fabulous portrayal of julie's no-nonsense beau george brent with whom davis also was rumored to have had an affair also turns in a strong performance as buck the honorable gentleman who duels his best friend to defend julie's honor br br this is a wonderful film with great acting and directing though not the epic that gwtw became it contains certain elements that selznick undoubtedly incorporated at tara since the similarities between the films are striking at times i rated this film a 10/10 for anyone interested in seeing why bette davis is considered one of the great actresses of the studio era this film is a must
