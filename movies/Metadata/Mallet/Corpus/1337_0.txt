i first saw this movie late at night on tbs i read the info of it and wanted to check it out just because alicia silverstone and christopher walken was in it once it started i instantly thought it would come out ok the plot was great it was hilarious when alicia tied herself up then locking herself in the trunk all of a sudden this actor comes along i assumed it was benicio del toro cause thats what the info said anyway i knew i'd seen him somewhere and thought this would be interesting the acting responses he gave were great and at first i thought he couldn't speak english cause he doesen't say a word till he goes to the diner for coffee waiting for the telephone anyway the fight scene with them is great i love how as they stick together they gradually become friends then well you can probably guess but i wont say anyway i too gradually came to really liking del toro till he became one of my favorite actors this was such a movie worth staying up for the acting and chemistry between alicia and benicio i think it's great you see for yourself and if you don't agree than poor you love it first benicio movie i'd ever seen
