after reading the enthusiastic comments posted so far i feel guilty admitting i was bitterly disappointed by vengo i'd enjoyed latcho drom and even went out and purchased the sound-track cd br br but vengo left me cold too much mediocre acting far too much melodrama and far too little flamenco for my taste br br at one point the main character characterizes the music being played as flamenco puro and bangs his fist on the cafe table to underscore his fervor i agreed with him at that moment but aside from that one cafe scene i found little in the movie that seemed puro to me and much that sounded globalized and tawdry br br i am voting only two stars on this one
