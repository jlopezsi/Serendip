this movie is a prime example of how the simplest things can mushroom out of control architect marc vincent lindon has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is he feels part of him then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache he starts by asking his live-in lover agnes manu devos whether she would still fancy him sans moustache since she's only known him with it she can't answer so out comes the razor and then comes the uneasiness that segues into genuine fright not only does devos not notice the difference but neither do their friends and his colleagues at work we are now on the fringes of a kafkaesque scenario which isn't really resolved satisfactorily for reasons that eluded me marc by now convinced that devos has some hidden agenda he can't fathom lights out for hong kong literally in just the clothes he stands up in and spends a few days weeks months riding the ferry before devos shows up or does she for one thing how did she know where he was and/or track him down to the fleabag where's he's taken a room lots of food for thought here and the acting is out of the right bottle if anybody asks you
