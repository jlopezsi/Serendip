i grew up in the 1940s and my sister and i went to the movies all the time i recalled the name irene dunne but i had never seen her in a movie well last night i did in roberta 1935 what a voice like a nightingale her rendition of smoke gets in your eyes was the most beautiful version that i have ever heard i found myself wishing she would sing for at least another half hour br br there were also the exquisite exciting beautiful gowns and furs my own mother was a real beauty in the l940s and seeing the fashions of that time really made me wish i was a woman during that era rather than a child then too i loved the sets done predominantly in white and ever so glamorous br br as if that wasn't enough of a treat we had the exquisite team of astaire and rodgers their numbers were breathtaking two bodies that moved as one smooth free-flowing what grace i found the storyline boring but the talent and beauty that filled the screen sure made up for that
