i personally have thought this movie was fantastic i am a huge fan of naomi judd and thoroughly enjoyed her part in the film gerald mcraney seemed like a good match for her in the story mcraney always seems to play a tough guy in all his roles which is another reason i loved his part because judd simply softened his heart and made him sweet a first for gerald alison pill was simply wonderful her voice was captivating and the love she had for her music teacher was enormous surprising to see andy play such a hard core ex soldier but he played the part of a stubborn old man very well i was amazed at how greatly the characters clicked with their parts the directer made very wise choices on actors
