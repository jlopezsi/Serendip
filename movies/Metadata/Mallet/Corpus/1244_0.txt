i saw this movie at 2 am late one night in 1997 at first i only kept watching because there was nothing else on and it looked a little slow for my tastes as the movie went on i was drawn into the drama of the girls being kidnapped but the moment that laura pulled up to her house saw the infamous black car moving toward her daughter and i suddenly remembered the mechanic at the beginning of the movie mentioning that all he had to repair the bus with was a racing engine and transmission i was glued to my seat the pacing of the movie was perfect even when introduced to that sudden twist and chase scene i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes either social dramas or car chases
