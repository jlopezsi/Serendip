this was by no means the best film i had ever seen it wasn't a particularly original premise or story nor were the jokes and gags that great and it will by no means end up in the pantheon of the great buddy dramas br br but this movie was entertaining and isn't that the point the movie had some language that might offend some and a lot of the humor was crude the base of this movie however was sam jackson in a familiar sam jackson character and eugene levy in typical eugene levy role br br it only lasted 80 minutes or so and there were not big plot twists just a quick story with a few laughs not something that i would want to watch over and over but worth renting or watching on cable
