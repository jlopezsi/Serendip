i think rona da ricci maria is one of the most beautiful women i've ever seen if anyone has any pictures information or her phone number i'd be very interested br br this is a horrifically dark adaptation of edgar allen poe's story set in the oppressively religious society of spain at the time of the inquisition the film is well-written although a few things don't quite sit right with me firstly the comic relief character is a bit vacuous at least i think he was supposed to be funny secondly there is reference to the roman catholic church trying to stop the grand inquisitor from murdering innocent people in the name of god i somehow doubt that the organization that instigated and perpetuated these massacres over the centuries in whatever manifestation worked for the time and place would turn so vehemently against it at any stage let alone against a wing of it's own organization i think it was something of a cop-out on the part of the creators of this film apart from this however the film is enthralling intriguing and predominately well-acted though the male lead leaves something to be desired also the cinematography deserves a mention br br not for everyone but if you have a strong stomach it's definitely worth a look
