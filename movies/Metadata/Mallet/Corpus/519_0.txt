scenario and story the story evolves around 4 teenagers skipping school camp and admitting themselves to be locked up in a hole for 3 days voluntarily what 3 of the 4 don't know is that one of them has planned all of this a friend martyn of hers liz came up with the idea of the hole to be locked up with the guy mike she loves for those 3 days br br it's slow upfront but when the first person franky frances dies of starvation because the girl is on an extreme diet the movie gets intense as not to give everything away i won't tell the rest of the story suffice to say liz cunning plan doesn't work out completely like she planned it br br acting and directing the acting by the four teenagers is very good both the school part as the hole part especially thora birch as liz the cool but always plotting girl who's desperately in love with a guy when she finds this love not answered she get's even colder the psychologist dr philippa horwood who has been trying to get the horror stuff out of liz through therapy does a good job too as a sort of narrative point without narrating anything br br audio and cinematography nothing wrong with the music and sound effects it all adds greatly to the eerie and weird atmosphere not too cheesy not too light just right cinematography is great as well very good use of environment lighting and colour no errors no odd stuff br br conclusion in the end the movie is very good but still misses something and that mostly is for the storytelling/development account the whole point of the movie is the love of liz for mike and that has not been worked out enough in the movie 7 out of 10 from me
