i thought i'd do a quick review actually i didn't really ever plan on watching this movie frankly the words lisa kudrow and movie just make shudder but a friend who's taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when i saw it playing on tmn i thought i'd watch it the movie office space came to mind on more then on occasion while watching this i do give office space a slightly higher rating but the two movies are not that unalike in their styles both are subtle intelligent comedies that challenge the viewer i've said this about other movies and it applies here too if you want to be spoon fed your laughs rent ace ventura if you've ever sat in an office with nothing to do for 8 hours rent this movie it only takes 2
