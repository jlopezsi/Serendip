please note this review is for the english-dubbed version it's about 11 minutes shorter than the original film and i have no way of knowing how close it stuck to the original vision it seemed to be dubbed reasonably well but having never seen the original chinese version i am only guessing br br the idea of making a corsican brothers-like film with two jackie chans sounded pretty dumb when i read about this movie and while in parts it is awfully silly the overall effort was far better than i expected and was one of the better chan movies i have seen br br the movie begins with a prologue which shows how two twins were accidentally separated just after birth the parents cannot locate the lost child and are forced to raise the remaining child the second is fund by what appears to be a prostitute and this child is raised in a poor household many years later when the rich and privileged jackie returns to hong kong he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one the one that the local mob wants to kill now had this just been an action film with fight scene after fight scene i think it wouldn't have worked as well but given that jackie chan did the movie a huge amount of comedy and clever situations involving two separate girlfriends were infused into the plot several times i found myself laughing at some of the silliness of it all but i also was impressed by how well the film all worked together pretty seamlessly br br there were only two complaints about the film first the poor jackie snorted a lot why couldn't there have been a better way to distinguish between them than making one of them sound like he's a pig or has a really bad cold secondly the film seemed to go on a bit too long particularly at the action-packed conclusion knocking five or ten minutes off would have probably made the film a bit better as the fight scene just went on and on and on still this is a decent martial arts film and is worth a look and a laugh br br fyi the film's second billing went to maggie cheung a relatively famous asian actress who has made a variety of excellent films however her role was no bigger or more prominent than the other lady in the film who didn't appear until much further in the credits bummer
