with the exception of andrei tarkovsky soviet cinema remains rather unknown this side of the atlantic for those who haven't yet indulged further grigori chukhrai's ballad of a soldier is a good introduction more universal less political not as formally difficult and quite a bit more fast-moving demonstrated quite literally by sped-up shots of a tank near the beginning than most other soviet fare br br in general the film is a delicate lyrical story about a young soviet soldier who goes off to fight the germans and then gets just enough leave time to come back to his small village and see his mother this return journey takes up most of the film and along the way our hero meets a girl falls in love and sees a variety of characters affected in different ways by the war everything is presented in episodes and the film feels at times like it's in chapters br br although the dvd cover and title make ballad of a soldier appear to be a war movie be warned that really it's not it's sentimental about love fleeting decidedly poetic however it's never mush and its poetry is often quite good if you're in the right mood i reckon this film can really hit the soft nostalgic spots br br and if your guy or gal is a bit eccentric reads dostoyevsky and kundera and is into foreign cinema ballad of a soldier even makes a decent date movie
