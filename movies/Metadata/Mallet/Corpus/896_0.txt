we my wife and i really enjoyed this documentary movie on the fragile coral reefs as this is in the imax format you really feel like your are diving in the south pacific or the caribbean we are occasional scuba divers and snorkelers and have always loved the magnificent hues of coral reef waters so anyone with similar interests should see this documentary as it makes a strong message about the reefs and shows the beauty we all may lose if left unprotected the colors are very vibrant and the surround sound is just another benefit added to the great musical score by crosby stills nash you'll go home singing all those classics from their deja vu album from the late 60's
