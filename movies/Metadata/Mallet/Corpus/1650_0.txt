this silent movie concerns the road to the throne in late fourteen century england of scheming and ruthless richard duke of gloucester i am really interested in the character created by shakespeare and the historical richard both but trying to make a movie based upon a play in 1912 when cinema was silent is quite difficult so if you haven't read the play is possible that sometimes you find yourself puzzled about what is going on although restored titles summarize the plot well mr warde gives a creepy feeling to the character showing at the same time a brutal and fearful man as possibly the real richard iii was i recommend this movie to all shakespeare lovers a long time go i watched the movie made by lawrence olivier like too keep in mind that this movie was done when cinema tricks like editing or crosscutting was yet not in use so the way of filming is quite simple they put the camera and shoot all the scenes in a medium shot there is only a brief shot closer to richard reminds me all the movie the frankenstein made by edison in 1910 so if you love shakespeare old movies well transferred to dvd and tasting the feeling of watching a near 100 years old flick see it i give it 7 stars out of 10
