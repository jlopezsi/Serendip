four teens at a uk boarding school decide to skip a school trip and party in the bomb shelter soon they realized they are actually locked in and mayhem ensues hmmm this finally got released on dvd in the us and i am a bit disappointed the trailer made this seem like a creepy straight-up horror flick but it is more of a psychological thriller it is entertaining and not predictable at first but when you find out what is actually going on it does get a little silly the performances are mostly good thora birch shines as always while it isn't groundbreaking or a great film the hole is better than most contemporary teen horror/thrillers my rating 6.5/10
