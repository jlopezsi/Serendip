before i completely tear apart this abortion let me come out and say that this game should not be praised at all whoever applauds square for this game isn't experienced in a the world of writing or b)the field of video games now i've been playing rpgs for quite some time and i know a tasteless game when i see one br br graphics much like that of ffvii's style final fantasy vii's graphics are 3-dimensional however there are still so many flawed aspects for example the characters are deprived of facial expressions 2/10 sound the musical collection of final fantasy viii veers away from the norm although the theme of this installment was a nice touch the rest of the soundtrack was bitterly mediocre in comparison to that of its predecessors 4/10 plot do i really need to explain how dull this game is i suppose so then sigh well after the first disk you're left with a cheap plot in reference to the events i'll put them in order from 1 to 5 br br 1 the supposed genius squall becomes a seed along with his moronic friends br br 2 squall meets his apparent girlfriend rinoa and drifts away from the interverte-lifestyle little by little br br 3 after totally pwning the insipid blob edea and her lackey seifer squall realizes that his job applies to murdering the sorceresses of this wretched fantasy br br 4 after beating edea's butt again ultimecia controls rinoa's fail!mary-suish body br br 5 squall and friends gain control of their sue and beat ultimecia's butt yeah i said butt again oooo that's about it the developers decided on tying in some other events but that idea kinda died r.i.p good idea 1/10 playability remember the junction system do you ever recall the amount of time that you spent spamming your character's stats with efficient spells such as ultima or aero but to punish these actions you must first equip your faithful gf to any of the characters how long does this process take again fifteen to twenty minutes at least br br in fact the junction system is so time-consuming that you resort to actually turning off this game after this process is completed the gameplay isn't stimulating as well br br value relatively low br br overall rating 1/10 i hope that this review will fix the crappy rating that this game scored d
