here's another great contender for my own personal award of most demented film i ever watched but the least i can say is that it was very interesting the pschotronic man begins with the longest and most unnerving opening credits ever but they're quite sinister and atmospheric what with the really creepy music and odd color schemes and everything this is one of them rare films that already make you feel uncomfortable before it even properly takes off the slow-paced story introduces rocky foscoe a barber with a few issues that may or may not be caused by the fact that he consumes his own hair shampoos and conditioner lotions rocky starts having strange visions like himself flying around in a car and such similar tomfoolery and he gradually becomes the world's first and only psychotronic man basically this just means that he's an older fatter and sleazier male version of carrie who can inflict stuff only by using his overdeveloped willpower at first rocky doesn't comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn't like like his own wife who's in the way of his love affairs br br the psychotronic man is overall a pretty cool flick but sadly director jack m sell wasn't quite sure which narrative tone to maintain does this story require a dramatic mysterious or exploitative tone or perhaps a combination of all three this indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision the film is also slow and uneventful especially considering the plot outline they could have made this into a far more grotesque and trashy cult experiment even bearing in mind the budgetary restrictions the overlong chase sequence for example is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema the cars just drive in straight lines and at snail pace without tricky maneuvers or causing flamboyant accidents still there's some greatness to find in this oddball production like the creepy sound effects that are frequently repeated including a church bell chiming and half the tune of ennio morricone's classic music for once upon a time in the west i bet the composer of this film was the only person who had great fun on set br br bizarre film to say the least but it did offer us the collective term for everything in cult horror and trash cinema that is unique and indescribable psychotronic power
