a great film the visuals the music the times i was 8 years old when the film came out but oddly enough i can relate to it more so on a subconscious level as i hardly remember being eight the visuals affect me deeply as well as the music someone pointed out it being haunting i definitely got the same feeling the movie made me cry but i don't know why at least not on a conscious level the story line does remind me of when i was a kid a time when kids played outdoors using nothing more than their imagination and whatever they could find to play with and being content also it reminded me of a carefree time of boys being boys a must to watch and enjoy
