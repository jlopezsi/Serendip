i give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it real and one point for the filmmakers truly laudable efforts br br four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since j3 was made maybe more it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub cheesy 3-d props et al br br however like most badly executed thrillers with substandard eye-candy j3 has a worthy message for all of us try to bottle nature in an attractive theme park package and nature will get back at you in a deadly often gruesome way br br most interesting here are the two-dimensional stock characters they surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions br br what we may initially perceive as the secondary villain the manager of this aquatic theme park calvin turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater unlike the previous two films in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry mayor calvin made me laugh when i realized his character was just all attitude and talk he is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands 35 feet of man-eating death br br the heroes god save what's left of their present acting careers also prove brave and honorable br br my favorite character however was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in tranquilizing the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air so that escape seems all the more possible br br brief review j2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach j4 br br j4 stinks and sinks pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of michael caine and lorraine gary polluting our oceans these landlubbers belong either on the broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands sitting quietly counting their box-office money br br see jaws 3 if anything it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show where red popcorn goes flying off into the audience br br
