thats right those small kid robot things uhhhhhh shudders br br anyway a good sci-fi flick that sometimes a bit cheesy but otherwise it dosen't let you down as far as action and suspense goes christian duguay dan o'bannon and philip k dick did a fair job at a movie that has a decent jab at the sci-fo genre although one of the lesser sci-fis(in my opinion the storyline would have to be one of the best and the characters fit in perfectly peter weller does a splendid job as hendricksson his acting performance is probably up there with his robocop one and it probably lifted his career to new heights special effects impress for 1995 as this helps lift screamers to new heights a good movie for anyone who wants a creepy sci-fi br br overall 70
