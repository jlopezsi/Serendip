i have really enjoyed deadwood so much i bought the three seasons on dvd and i don't buy many dvds i do believe it to be the best made series ever all aspects are spot on and the attention to detail is fantastic the use of language of the period is amazing being dickensian at moments the acting is superb and the sets are fantastic i don't think i have seen busier streets anywhere it is all enthralling but it just stops br br two more feature length shows are talked about but hbo don't seem to be doing anything other than saying they will not be easy or cheap to make if you are a fan of the show please see http savedeadwood.net for info on how and where to apply pressure
