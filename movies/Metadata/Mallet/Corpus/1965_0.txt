it has been sometime since i have seen this television movie it is an eerie film imaginatively made considering the budget that this film had which was not much when we had fewer stations that we do now films like this were still being seen in the afternoons on affiliate stations to abc this show was part of the tuesday or wednesday movie of the week that abc had it was from this series that duel directed by steven spielberg came from regrettably many of these other films i think were equal to duel but these directors and writers from what i can see never were able to come close to spiebergs fame br br todays tv movies seem to be made with bigger budgets but watching a film like cold nights death shows what greatness can be done with a limited budget the tuesday and wednesday night movies on abc were not all good but some of them deserve greater status than has been accorded them these films remind me of the excellent b movies we have heard about that hollywood made as a second feature in their heyday those in the 1970's who looked upon the 1950's as some great creative time on tv forgot about these films even in the 1970's when american films were some of the best ever film critics then were also not appreciative of what they had before them br br hopefully buried treasures like a cold night's death and other films will get their re release either on tv or on dvd's apparently this film is available on dvd to purchase but many others may not be
