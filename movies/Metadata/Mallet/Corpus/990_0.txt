i saw this movie and found it extremely puzzling the child emil is the least sympathetic character i have seen since the good son emil is cold calculating and manipulates the other characters with no conscience whatsoever br br i found the ending the most curious of all emil attempts to murder pat and because he cries over it and confesses the nazis kept him in a dark cell for what his father did the family forgives all this seems to be a recipe for disaster the end credits roll but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won't try to do it again when he doesn't get his way nuts
