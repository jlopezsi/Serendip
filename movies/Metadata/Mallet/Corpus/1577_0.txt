i first saw this episode when it was originally aired in 1961 and have since collected it on laserdisc even seeing it with the eyes of an inexperienced 10 year old the power and message it carried compressed into a half-hour time-bomb was at least as formidable as what was meant to destroy the librarian romney wordsworth meredith and weaver both turn in laser-like performances guided skillfully by the words of mr serling's pen it also benefits from the simplicity of the sets and the always-present black and white format which i believe creates a greater focus on the characters br br it is episodes like this that ensure that the names rod serling and the twilight zone will be remembered and honored for excellence in television for a very long time to come
