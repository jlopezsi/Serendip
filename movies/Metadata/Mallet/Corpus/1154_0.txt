i was told about this movie by a friend he said it was one of the best movies he had seen unfortunately he told me the ending but i won't spoil that for you br br prison song is a film about a boy brought up in group homes with a gift of art he does beautiful drawings and is an excellent photographer he is accepted to college and at first his gets a full scholarship but then something changes and it is taken away this is one of the many times our principle character is let down he gives up on his dream and gets angry he ends up picking a fight with one of the boys from the group home and kills him he ends up in jail 15 years to life br br the movie to me is a musical relief actors do break out into song or rap throughout the movie but fortunately this break from spoken word to words of rhythm and melody has a smooth transition transitions are so smooth that it seems almost real like it was something anyone would do when reflecting br br rapper q-tip place the principle character and plays it well though he is quiet most of the time the viewer will feel almost every emotion he does even when his face is plain as a blank piece of paper through the film you grow to love the character and feel bad that things worked out the way they did he is like many black men like many men period talented but locked in jail br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a prison movie with a lot of heart in it characters are deep and the story line is rich
