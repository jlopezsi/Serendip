i first saw the shepherd of the hills outdoor drama when we visited branson for the first time in the late 1970's my family and i were totally unfamiliar with this southwest missouri area and this was only a few years prior to the branson area's explosion onto the entertainment scene it expanded from 6 or 8 theaters then with perhaps 5,000 seats to several times this number today with more seats than all of broadway it's possible there now for someone to attend something like 50 or 60 shows for a month one every evening and a number of breakfast or matin√©e performances and never see the same one twice with additional ones available if one wishes to begin a second month br br from earlier days and continuing today two of the cornerstone attractions in the branson area are silver dollar city theme park modeled after an 1880's silver mining complex but with 21st-century new york city or hollywood pricing and the shepherd of the hills farm the original cabin the large outdoor amphitheater which presents a lavish production of the story a restaurant gift shop etc they also have all the information about characters upon whom the book is based and harold bell wright that one could possibly want to know and then some br br this film's version of the book and story is well-played the scenery well-photographed especially since footage was done 65 years ago and the characters interesting however the story here represents the book about as well as if john wayne's film red river had been presented with this title and its characters renamed to coincide with this story br br first the elder mathews were not a female moonshiner and her wimpy husband they were leading citizens operated the mill and were an asset to their rural community and their fellow residents br br young matt and sammy as a couple were more like characters from the waltons than those portrayed the shepherd was also a model citizen-type no gunfighter or ex-con and was no relation to young matt whatever br br actually the shepherd was the father of the young man who had fathered the mentally-challenged young pete the son of the mathews late daughter his son had loved her had returned east not realizing he had left her pregnant and was prevented by his father the shepherd from returning and subsequently disappeared br br the shepherd had come to the area to view the situation and attempt amends during the actual book and the drama as still presented in branson today the unknown specter character appears throughout is shot and dies but before passing is discovered to be the shepherd's lost son and there is a heartfelt resolution of matters towards the end br br the shepherd also achieves rapprochement with old matt who had threatened mayhem should he ever encounter the man he blamed for his daughter's broken heart and death br br wash gibbs is a nefarious character with designs upon sammy and a rival of matt in both versions but in the book he is still a baldnobber and gangster the baldknobbers were vigilantes who had done worthy things for the citizenry in the post-civil war period with carpetbaggers and others attempting to plunder the areas but like a lot of such groups when there was no further need for their good works they turned their prodigious physical strengths to illegal self-serving ends br br several interesting key characters from the novel are missing from this film e.g jim lane sammy's father is more of a key element than shown here and the marjorie main character with the over-the-top scene where she regains her sight represents no key element of wright's story the name moanin meadow and its representation in the movie have no part in wright's book while in both presentations the characters were simple hill folk neither sophisticated nor educated the film provides many with a far greater bumpkin image br br again this is an excellent film but i would have enjoyed even more seeing the same characters presented as actually portrayed by wright
