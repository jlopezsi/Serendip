though lacking in character development tom clancy novels are superb for their plot intricacies and fervent attention to detail the hunt for red october the best film adaptation of the jack ryan series thus far still stands as my favorite film of all time br br like any writer sensing opportunity clancy decided to franchise his name to such series as op center and net force op center was actually a surprisingly ok tv mini-series thanks to the efforts of harry hamlin and lindsay frost net force however is a total disaster br br it's difficult even to establish blame while the notion of an internet investigations division of the fbi sounds appealing isn't the secret service in fact charged with this responsibility everything in op center is ludicrous the sophomoric romantic storyline of bakula and going the uber bill gates villain played by judge reinhold and the kris kristofferson can you believe he was in fact a rhodes scholar and former army pilot dead mentor with a secret all of this just defies conventional wisdom or reality br br without belaboring the point net force is just plain not entertaining
