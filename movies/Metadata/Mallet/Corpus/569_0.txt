as a fan of slasher movies i have to say that the direction in drive thru isn't too impressive often being of the point and shoot variety in addition most of the kills take place off-screen and at first glance the story is also highly unimaginative a teenage girl called mackenzie carpenter mac to her friends discovers that pupils at her high school are being killed by a maniac who's dressed as horny the clown the mascot of the hellaburger fast-food restaurant chain he looks like the secret love child of ronald mcdonald and satan br br so far so clich√©d but drive-thru's script then proceeds to overturn most of the conventional rules of the slasher movie genre br br for example traditionally the heroine in these films is always a quiet likable well behaved and respectable young girl who is often bullied or victimised by the popular in-crowd not so in drive-thru here the final girl is a foul mouthed drug-taking teen who thinks her parents are morons and together with her emo friends behaves appallingly to anyone she doesn't like there's even a clever subplot in which we learn that she's decided not to sleep with her older boyfriend until she reaches the age of consent but just as it seems that the movie is finally reverting to convention she changes her mind and has underage sex with him anyway br br another slasher clich is the creepy janitor who often acts as either a prime suspect or red herring but again drive-thru acts as though it's playing the game only to suddenly perform a bodyswerve and wrong-foot us so yes the creepy janitor is dutifully introduced but he promptly gets killed in the very next scene br br the movie also skilfully satirizes current american youth culture in addition to mac's emo friends horny also takes his machete to handgun-flaunting wiggas right-wing wasp preppies goth wiccans and stoner drop-outs there's also a surprisingly political edge that's rare in the genre mac is described as a vegetarian left-wing liberal and the dialogue contains quite a few barbs aimed at the bush administration and republicans in general mac also regards the police as incompetent fascists and doesn't tell them anything she's discovered about the murders because she believes she's got a better chance of uncovering who the killer is in fact the female detective in charge of the case is actually highly efficient but her investigation is being hampered by mac's refusal to share information br br the cast all deliver solid performances with leighton meester who plays mac being a particular find there's also a funny cameo from supersize me writer/director morgan spurlock as a hellaburger manager br br but despite being a highly entertaining movie drive-thru isn't particularly scary horny is a colourful and visually striking psycho-villain but the climax of the movie is quite weak and the only scene that delivers a genuine frisson is when the killer clown empties a gasoline can over mac as she's tied to a chair as a prelude to immolating her and she starts screaming in complete helpless terror
