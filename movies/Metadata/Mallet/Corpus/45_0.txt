i found lonely man in a local library i can't believe it only has 26 votes on the imdb this is not as great as the anthony mann films i've studied in grad school there is one with anthony perkins called the tin star which i would recommend more but this is still a good western which doesn't follow the conventional theme/structure narrative worth a look
