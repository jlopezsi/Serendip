there's a bit of unintended notoriety connected with the title of this film you have to see the 1996 quentin tarantino and robert rodriguez writer-director collaboration from dusk til dawn an un-p.c film if ever there was one to get it the movie's characters have set up shop at a trucker's and biker's bar the titty twister to cool their heels the m.c announces a new entertainer for the stage a woman named santanico pandemonium the voluptuous actress salma hayek steps out draped with a huge snake and little else and proceeds to rock her hips to the delight of every man who can see her it's a stunning moment toward the middle of a not very striking flick br br satanico pandemonium isn't only exploitation it belongs to a genre called nunsploitation the place is spain and the time is most likely pre-1834 sister maria cecilia pezet is a devoted nun who finds herself visited by visions of satan or luzbel the devil appears as a man to sister maria and using obvious biblical symbolism tends to carry a bitten-into apple sister maria is startled and horrified by the series of temptations that happen to her via the film's faulty special effects as another user has pointed out this is an obsession scenario by an external devil br br one important observation should be stated the actress playing sister maria is very beautiful with warm bedroom eyes and many of us meaning men wouldn't mind watching her getting robbed of her virtue as well as tormented by particular sins but what happens is with a little influence from beelzebub sister maria soon indulges in lesbianism child seduction and heresy the film has a church-like quality to the way it moves slowly and harps upon moments of less-than-dramatic value and with its fantastic logic sister maria turns into hell in a headdress one scene in particular is actually quite disturbing with sister maria covering her naked bloody body with her uniform br br the flick isn't entirely baldfaced exploitation though with interesting questions about faith in the dialogue that aside the flick's appeal seems rather obvious in life most of us want what we cannot have and the fantasy of despoiling such a person i.e a nun can be very powerful satanico pandemonium uses its subject matter effectively and despite an unsatisfying story resolution it packs quite a wallop
