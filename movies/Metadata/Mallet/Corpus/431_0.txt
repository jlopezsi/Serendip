this movie was not bad it was horrible the acting was at best equivalent to that of a high school production the special effects were by far the worst i had ever seen if you could not tell that the alien is a puppet then i am sorry for you the movie was bad even by the scifi channel standards the bad guy character is pretty much your standard villain who has a shallow disposition and crummy dialog the same goes for the rest of the marines if our troop really were to act as they did in this film then we would all be doomed one of the only redeeming scenes was the alein autopsy scenes the black and white with grain texture was by far the biggest expense to the budget however this scene is also has some of the worst alien acting in the movie
