i'm happy to see that not many people have seen this this thing at the same time it's strange that so many have voted it a 10 then again if you enjoy watching badly conceived shows of old music that you won't understand for the most part because of the foreign language for one and a half hours then i guess this is paradise br br personally i think the movie is utterly pretentious and extremely amateurishly done nonsense several people walked out of the theater when i saw this movie i really tried i really did but i couldn't stand it either this is a movie about some german music person that i had never heard of before the special effects are worse than bad take a look at the flames in the beginning the female singer who looks like a guy they film her hairy armpit in the middle of the screen for minutes i mean come on people we are doing a movie here there is a reason you have a make-up department one of the dancers in a scene is rather bulky i have nothing against people with big-bones but again we are producing a film all these stupid things just turn the movie into a parody of itself avoid at all costs
