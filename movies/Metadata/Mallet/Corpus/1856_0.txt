of the very few japanese samurai movies i've seen this is without a doubt the best it's about this woman who was born in a prison and raised by a samurai priest who teaches her the deadly arts in order to take revenge on the people who killed her father the fact that this is the main inspiration for tarantino's homage to the samurai genre kill bill is apparent all the way through it from the main theme song from this film being used in kull bill to many shots copied and the film being divided into chapters what's very good about this film is that you'll have no problem understanding and following the story without any confusion which happens a lot when you watch foreign cinema no this film is so thoroughly told that you wont miss a thing i definitely recommend this film to any movie buff or tarantino fan
