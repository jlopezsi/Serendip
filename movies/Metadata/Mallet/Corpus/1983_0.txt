i was rather disappointed with this film after the high voter rating my guess is that most of the high votes came from gay viewers who were happy to see gay love featured so prominently in a mostly unremarkable film br br sure there were some memorable moments that's why it didn't totally stink but the film otherwise dragged if the love had been between a man and a woman you could say this movie has already been made a thousand times philandering man with slightly psychotic woman br br the action and intrigue are minimal if you want to see a gay love story and sure good acting you might enjoy this movie but don't be fooled into thinking its a thriller or an action movie as i was
