i saw starquest ii under the title galactic odyssey it stinks under any title having nothing to do with the original this roger corman release is another in a long line of films that steals scenes from battle beyond the stars some other movie i couldn't identify and makes very little sense here's a rundown of what i understood br br various individuals from earth awake on a spaceship having few memories of their lives wandering around the ship they come across three people who claim to not know what is going on in reality these beings are aliens from a dying race they have surgically implanted something into some of the humans their plan is for the humans to fornicate yup it must be a roger corman movie so that their race will continue but as expected there is a mutiny among the aliens and people being to die off blah blah blah br br it is hard to figure out what in the world robert englund is doing in this movie he can do so much better there is nothing in this movie worthy of praise start your own star quest and look for a movie that actually shines just a little bit zanatos's score 1 out of 10
