this is one of those really cool pardon the pun made-for-tv flicks you would come across in the 1970s i'm a total sucker for that sub-genre of the horror flick called scientists stranded in the frozen wastelands other examples both versions of the thing and the original outer limits episode known as the human factor there's just something about the frozen north as a setting that captures and holds the imagination like no other not even the venerable old haunted house on a dark and stormy night does it for me like the icy tundra of an isolated frozen research station brrrrrrrr check this one out for sophisticated science fiction chills
