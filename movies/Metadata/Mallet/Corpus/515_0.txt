i had avoided this film for some reason maybe it was the plot details but when i viewed it i was pleasantly surprised br br thora birch's english accent is very good and she makes us believe her performance which is vital in this film the story more or less revolves around her version of events and after the first 30 minutes you get the feeling that everything is not what it appears to be br br i won't give anything away but this film isn't essential viewing but i'd recommend that you do at some time watch it br br the main cast of five do well in what could have been a disaster but they all hold their roles well but the shining star in this film is birch herself it's her film to be honest and she carries it well enough br br i felt at times though that the actors were generalising 1 dimensional acting oh i'm playing irritating now you'll get the picture br br so all in all a decent film with a nice kinda storyline to it and as we're in thriller territory expect a twist that was sooooooo obvious right at the end oh well br br 8/10<br br enjoy
