this movie has all the elements i like donald sutherland is one of my favorite actors i like science fiction robert heinlein is one of my favorite authors i also like horror movies how could all these potentially great elements be combined into one of the worst movies i've ever seen it is forgivable to change the story if the changes make for better filming but in this movie the changes don't improve anything the added material is pointless as well i could go on for many lines but this abysmal movie is just not worth wasting the time what's the line they managed to snatch failure from the very jaws of success
