normally when it comes to voting for movies on the imdb i'm quite liberal i don't set very high standards for movies i always tend to rate films based on how much i enjoy them and this means that most of the time i always rate films highly cos i try and find something good in every film i see i saw this film when i was vacationing in england bbc one actually transmitted this at 11 pm since they believed that the peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 9:00 slot unlike the peacemaker shooting fish is a film that almost anybody would enjoy unless he/she was the kind of person who found simple effective storytelling a turnoff br br everything about this movie seems in perfect harmony the chemistry between dan futterman and stuart townsend is perfect word for word and kate beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle when the conversations in the movie occur you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold that's a hallmark of a good scriptwriter and the people who wrote this deserve credit for the story br br as for the story itself it never lets itself become too complicated and lends itself to a lot of funny situations fast-talking dylan and socially naive jez futterman and townsend are two con men trying to raise money to build their dream house they end up enlisting georgina's short-haired kate beckinsale in a beautiful role from her pre-hollywood glamourpuss days help on a particular scam soon she discovers what they're up to and the story unfolds from there with both dylan and jez seemingly falling for georgie here again the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story rather the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale as for dan and jez some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them br br this film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular simply put they work on every level watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching while you were sleeping for example for the sheer sweetness of the film and for kate beckinsale's performance i'd give it 7 on 10
