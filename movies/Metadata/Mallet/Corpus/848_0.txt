ginger rogers stars as a pending bride who's noted for leaving her suitor(s at the altar but this time she's sure of her decision until a new suitor literally shows up in her dreams br br although i don't believe something like this could really happen i was in the mood for something light and i ended up watching this i've never been a big fan of the old movies but i saw chicago with gere zellweger and zeta-jones and then saw the film roxie hart 1927 with ginger rogers and kind of liked the campy comedy that this film portrayed so i keep an eye out for her on tcm and whenever i stumble across one of her films i try and watch them as i said i don't believe the premise of the film could ever happen but the way ginger looks at cornel wilde is believable and although it's probably with more infatuation than love i know every guy wishes for a girl to look at him that way br br the story won't necessarily keep you enthralled but your wondering how they're gonna get out of this predicament will 8 out of 10 stars
