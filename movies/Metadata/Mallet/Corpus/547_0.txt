sure this is a b movie but it is moody and creepy and worth a look haunting i haven't seen it since it was on tv nearly 20 years ago and i can't forget it the lemurians are really unsettling weirdos sure timothy bottoms is always a little suspicious but pretend he's a young george w bush and your path to movie fun is free and clear it'll be great plus lisa blount can't go wrong there generally i'm against so-called reviews which say for what it is it's whatever but in this case when something does manage to be genuinely unsettling i give it a go not much upsets or disturbs me but this got under my skin and i think that's worth praising write your local congressperson or entertainment conglomerate and demand a north american dvd release now
