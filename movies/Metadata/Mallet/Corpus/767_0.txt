this is an amazing movie about a father dedicated to finding his son who has been abducted by native americans in south america my mother stumbled across it some time ago and recorded it for me claiming she had watched it over a decade ago and it stuck with her since i watched it with my girlfriend and we were both amazed by the film i would not normally expect much from an old film but this one had everything the scenery was amazing the acting was excellent and the plot keeps your heart racing the abducted kid grows to become one of the natives and embarks on an amazing adventure following his fathers 10 year search for him it brings you deep into the amazon rainforest as you learn about the life of the invisible people tribesmen and their conflict with another terryfing tribe i cannot understand how this film has such a low rating nor the fact that it is not well known if you stumble across it be sure to watch because in my opinion this is the greatest film ever made
