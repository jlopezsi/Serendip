of all the films that quentin tarantino pays homage to in his kill bill films fujita's lady snowblood might have received the most because not do the kill bill films have screen shots almost taken directly from lady snowblood they also incorporate some of the music sung by lady snowblood's heroine kaji meiko like many other films from japan during the late 1960s and early 1970s lady snowblood was shot on a shoestring budget and at an incredibly fast pace however unlike many of the films made during that time period lady snowblood remains popular because while its plot had been done many times before including suzuki norifumi's sex and fury which was filmed the same year and whose background plot is almost identical to lady snowblood it possesses a certain style that differentiates it from many other films from this time period namely that the heroine seems to be able to keep her clothes on throughout the entire film and that while it has lots of blood and gore another influence evident in kill bill it is not too overdone also kaji meiko has quite a presence in front of the camera and her portrayal of the cool yuki is almost perfect br br penned by the creator of lone wolf and cub and hanzo the razor koike kazuo lady snowblood portrays the life of yuki a young woman who was born to seek revenge for her mother whose husband was the scapegoat of a plot set up by for villains so they could extort money from a poor village forced to shack up with one of the murderers yuki's mom is able to kill him however while searching for the other three she is arrested and put in prison in prison she sleeps with every man she can in order to get pregnant and eventually gives birth to yuki and dies soon afterward trained by a stern priest in martial arts and swordplay the child of the netherworld yuki begins her search for those who destroyed her family and her own life before she was even born br br while it may seem threadbare to many of today's film viewers lady snowblood should be considered one of the finest examples of films of its genre definitely recommended for those who enjoy swordplay and blood in their films and also recommended to those who enjoy older japanese films outside of the canonized films of kurosawa ozu and mizoguchi but it might not be for those with a weak stomach
