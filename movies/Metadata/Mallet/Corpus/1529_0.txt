its the sort of idea that inevitably gets tried out as soon as it becomes technically possible inter-cutting classic film noir with contemporary work to produce a comedy film usually such ideas come a serious cropper as was proved as others have stated by zelig however this film hits it right on the mark the design and editing allow for seamless cutting between the old and the new footage the script is good and has the right level of absurd humour to make the film work i'm not a fan of steve martin but its impossible to imagine anyone else matching this performance rachel ward is beautiful and sassy its a film of its time just made in time to catch the costume and musical talent of the past before they departed from the scene but made before the sort of hi-tech morphing and cgi which would have ruined its feel br br if you haven't seen it then watch it if you have seen it then watch it again this definitely rewards repeated viewings its no citizen kane but it is darned good entertainment if you share my sense of humour
