ginger snaps single-handedly raised my interest in lycanthropic cinema and ginger snaps unleashed is a remarkably strong sequel that works for many of the same reasons like the thoughtful horror cinema of george romero where deeper human issues boil under a more obvious horror surface ginger snaps used lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty and its impact on teenage relationships unleashed uses it as a metaphor for addiction with brigitte fitzgerald emily perkins it sister of the ill-fated ginger katharine isabelle injecting herself with wolfbane to curb her increasingly wolf-like tendencies while in a rehab clinic for troubled teens brigitte forges a relationship with ghost tatiana maslany a precocious girl whose seeming innocence unravels her secret the new writing/directing team of megan martin and brett sullivan pick up where the previous film left off skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition and the end result is extremely satisfying though the machinations of unleashed s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better perkins who is becoming a real horror ing√©nue plays brigitte with sympathy and sarcastic bite and her relationship with maslany comes close to matching the sense of sisterly love that provided the endearing backbone of the original ginger snaps unleashed is the rare sequel that does its parent proud
