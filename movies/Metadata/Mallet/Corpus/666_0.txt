as a lover of horror films and a particularly keen fan of werewolves even i found this film to be a total piece of crap not even slightly scary i have never been less scared while watching a horror film than this seriously ghostbusters seems like the exorcist compared to this load of tripe and julian sands has got to be the worst bad guy ever i reckon he's just reading lines off a prompter that's what it actually sounds like the only good thing about this film was seeing elsa patasky's breasts everything else was totally shite.it is even more of a shame because the idea has potential based on a real life self confessed werewolf well a dude suffering from lycanthropy romasanta had the potential to be seriously creepy especially with the dark forests of the area and the quaint little villages so horribly afraid of a big bad wolf total waste of time and coming from me this movie must be poor i like pretty much every piece of crap ever made
