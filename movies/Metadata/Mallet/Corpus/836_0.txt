darkness prevails already at the very beginning of la moustache emmanuel carrère's proper adaptation of his novel of the same title which he published back in the 1980's accompanying the opening credits is philip glass perfectly composed and utterly gloomy violin concerto which re-emerges throughout the movie and constantly supplies the global atmosphere of the film with an ominous and bewildering touch br br welcome to this year's most abstruse film and eventually the most challenging psychological experiment since the machinist presented at the 2005 cannes film festival in the quinzaine des réalisateurs category a category promoting abstract and rather unusual movies la moustache follows the intricate story of marc thiriez vincent lindon an ordinary parisian architect who slips into a vicious identity crisis after he spontaneously shaves off his moustache br br how would you react if i shaved off my moustache marc asks his girlfriend agnès emmanuelle devos before they visit some friends for dinner her reaction is not immediate and she simply replies i don't know i love you with it but i've never known you without it so while agnès leaves the apartment for a short time to do some shopping marc takes the risk and cuts off his beloved moustache just like that in order to see his lover's face and analyze her reaction when she returns home br br however marc will be severely disappointed upon agnès arrival she does not utter one single word she seems not to notice the major physical change in marc's face nor do their friends even marc's colleagues at the office fail to perceive the absence of his moustache is he on the verge of madness or has he become the target of a massive conspiracy triggered by his own girlfriend more weirdly did he even ever have a moustache or was it part of some unexplainable imagination marc has no clue at all how to react to his baffling new situation br br when you enter the official movie website a big question mark appears at the end of the flash intro this question mark is totally appropriate since it clearly illustrates what kind of movie la moustache really is namely a confusing puzzling drama with an open ending and a number of unexplainable twists flashbacks and mysterious appearances by characters when you least expect it what is la moustache about is the first question of a recent online interview conducted with emmanuel carrère the director himself has no answer to that crucial question br br indeed la moustache is one of these attention-grabbing cinematic mysteries that first baffle the spectators and then leave them behind with a bunch of questions unanswered there are though in this ingeniously structured and passionately filmed movie some easily detectable themes for once la moustache is an analysis of a dysfunctional couple tumbling into a conflict driven by mistrust marc soon accuses agnès of plotting against him but agnès is deeply persuaded that marc has in fact never had a moustache this marks the beginning of a series of violent arguments and disputes br br moreover carrère's film closely focuses on a man struggling with the inevitable loss of his personal identity marc is unable to distinguish between reality and imagination and so he struggles hard to uncover the origins of the problem he is a man all on his own against the rest of the world in his apartment he finds some old pictures from a vacation in bali all of them showing him with a moustache but is he really the only one to see it is the moustache on this photo real or not he does not know and we do not either br br especially the first part of la moustache is intensely compelling and dark examining the relationship between marc and agnès and closely focusing on marc's progressive battle to keep his emotional and moral nature under control when his consciousness slowly begins to shut down the tension mounts as the suspense grows and the atmosphere becomes more and more threatening carrère has a brilliant vision and he captures marc's way into madness in a diverse and appealing way br br marc is the perfect role for vincent lindon whose look is continually as puzzling as the story itself he masters his role with ideal perfection always acting authentically the same can be said about the brilliant emmanuelle devos la femme de gilles who delivers an enigmatic performance as agnès her complex character is a true object of curiosity and no one can trust her is she the evil woman ruining the mind of her partner or is she the reasonable person question marks gogo br br the last twenty minutes of la moustache which follow marc to bangkok where he repetitively embarks and disembarks ferries all day long are quite debatable yet very challenging the film reaches yet another climax takes another abrupt twist and once again challenges us spectators by sparking our curiosity please do not expect a satisfying explanation towards the very ending because la moustache ain't going to give you one many pieces of the puzzle remain untraceable but that's exactly what makes this masterpiece so intriguing and unique grade b
