this movie could very well have the best original score i've ever heard which is saying a lot because i pay close attention to such things so koichi sugiyama thank you for your excellent work that is the main reason why i voted a 10 on this movie the film is quite a bit silly at times but otherwise flawless i just wish more people had seen it friendship sacrifice loyalty destiny fate and love like i said wow
