if you want your films to have sympathetic characters you probably shouldn't go near this one this is a very tough and cynical thriller one that has no good guys only a whole lotta bad guys and a couple of not quite as bad guys but that's what i enjoyed about this film it was great to see the plot unfold in unexpected ways and to see these characters mess with one another motivated only by greed lust and fear another aspect is the film's sleek and cold style from the wardrobes to the apartments these characters occupy the film is pretty stylin and the acting is very good laurence fishburne is excellent as the amoral crowe frank langella is elegantly nasty as grimes and michael beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of fishburne's co-workers a very dark film that resolves itself quite nicely in the end and well worth seeing but if you need a good guy to root for this isn't the film to check out
