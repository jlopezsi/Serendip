i've read on imdb and some other sites that this movie was originally intended to be more of a comedy but that portions were re-shot and it was edited to be more of a slasher film i don't know if that's true but i will say that the best portions of this film are those left over from the comedy version some of the exposition and conversations are quite intentionally funny i especially like the explanation of why the groom's parents sister and grandmother all hate the best man low-key but classic br br other than the funny moments there's not much here the gore is pretty amateurish though plentiful the plot makes no sense and the scenes seem to switch back and forth between different sides of the same house which is used as a remote cabin a church a fellowship hall a school and a couple different homes it's cheerfully cheesy br br worth seeing if you don't have anything else available but don't put it on your preferred list
