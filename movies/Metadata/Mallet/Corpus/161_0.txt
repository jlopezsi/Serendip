i tried to see this film before because i remember the very beginning but i guess i was interrupted this time i saw it through and realized i was watching greatness this film has outstanding dialog and a very nuanced script oh if people today could only write like that it is no wonder i watch old movies this film is a clinic on dialog br br the acting was great across the board but the direction story script and casting were especially good it was a tightly woven story and an unusual one at that br br wells put in his best performance could it have been better maybe but the way he delivered those heart rending lines well maybe it couldn't have been much better his deep rich voice together with the tenderness wisdom and compassion well it doesn't get much better people who didn't appreciate that have not actually experienced life yet do not miss this when it comes around again i know i won't br br how good was it well this is the first time i felt compelled to comment on any films here
