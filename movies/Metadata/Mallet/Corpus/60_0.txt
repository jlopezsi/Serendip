loved this show as a kid about 18 years ago i always had a vague memory about the show and could never find information about it thank you for helping me find this imdb users from what i do remember about the show at the beginning of each episode a guy crawled through a log to get access to a secret clearing in the woods there he would play his guitar and sing songs the show aired sometime in the 80's and perhaps early 90's br br by any chance does anyone remember a show which would air around the same years as this show where there was a woman walking around with a net i can't remember if she was catching bugs or animal watching does this ring a bell for anyone
