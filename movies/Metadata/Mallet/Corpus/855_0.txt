sorry folks but i had some real problems with the movie i thought the cinematography and audio were great however i was not happy with the writing and directing i didn't find bill pullman's character very believable they just tried too hard to make him look like a character and in the end i only had disbelief not suspended the character of bo barrett was meant to be a sympathetic character but didn't come across as one to me the love triangle in the movie just seemed old fashioned why must the white guy always end up with the white girl there was good reason to fall in love with gustavo he made good wine and he exhibited heart but i saw little reason for her to fall in love with bo at one point she tells him and us that bo has heart but i didn't see much of it near the end it looks like he's trying harder but it just seemed so contrived bo came across as an empty-headed blonde for the first half of the movie and it was hard to believe that he developed passion in the end br br in the end i was also not happy about how the actual competition was portrayed why would any substantial french wine experts attend the first year of a competition setup by an ex-patriot brit wine seller with no customers if there was a good reason it was never presented it just didn't seem credible br br this is a movie that should be remade i like the story and i'd like to see it done right
