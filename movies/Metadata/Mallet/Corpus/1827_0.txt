a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic is the famous quote by stalin in this movie we see a marvellous illustration of the sentiment br br don't worry i didn't spoil anything we learn from the opening narration that this is the story of a fallen hero with that in mind the atmosphere of impending tragedy colours the entire film despite the film's rather charming presentation it's a wonderful irony because the director opens with such a powerful nihilistic statement but then he follows with a sweet and inspiring presentation which you might even call innocent br br i'm not exactly a fan of war movies but i don't consider this to be one at all there are very few details about the war no politics no propaganda essentially you can replace the russian uniforms with british german or japanese and the story would remain the same the ballad of a soldier oddly enough it's the compelling portrayal of rustic life which he encounters along his journey that provides the backbone and theme of this film a very human story br br it reminds me of the italian classic bicycle thieves as well as the japanese masterpiece ikuru by kurosawa each scene packs a lot of heart and the grand finale brings it all together poetically and artistically i won't mention any names but i sure wish certain other artsy russian directors could be as lucid and authentic in their presentations br br one more thing i can't end this review without mentioning the superb music the composer is listed as mihkail ziv but imdb offers no biographical info on him the melody is powerful and epic while being traditional and intimate at the same time it really mirrors the theme of the film perfectly things of great importance come in simple packages br br this movie gets 9 stars from me which is about the highest rating i ever give see it if you ever get the chance
