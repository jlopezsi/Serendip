i thought that the book was better then the movie if the movie was more like that book i think that it would have been better the movie had left out some details from the book that i think were pretty important for example in the movie rivka was hannah's cousin and in the book rivka was just a girl that hannah had meet in the camp another thing is that in the book there was a few chapters on how they were stuck on the train for 4 days with out anything to drink or eat and in the movie the left out that whole part that's why i think that the book was a lot better then the movie i think that if they had made the movie just like the book it would have been a lot better
