as a die-hard classic rock fan i absolutely love this movie rock school is a movie that every future rock star should see br br the person i was most amazed at was 12-year-old cj i've never seen so much talent in a young boy when he was at the zappalan festival everybody was bowing to him at the end of his performance br br will asa and tucker also had potential in music br br paul green is a really good teacher when you think about it even though he can go off sometimes it's usually for a good reason i like people that know what real music is br br in other words everybody go see that documentary 10 out of 10
