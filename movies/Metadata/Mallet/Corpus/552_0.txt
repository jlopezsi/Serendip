i can't even imagine what must have been running through the directors head when he did this movie without any doubt this is the worst horror movie i have ever seen in my life the story is plain a mad clown from hell omg that's very original seeks to kill as many teens as possible in the most brutal and horrific way i'm sure ur very impressed and extremely anxious to see this great film but hold ur horses drive-thru is a real test of character because it takes a real man/woman to see this movie till the end where like all great movies it leaves room for a sequel the action is weak the acting is weak the screenplay is even weaker the story is really overused and beside the cool clown costume it doesn't have anything worth watching all the lines are unnatural and the young actors take it even more below the average br br in conclusion do urselves a huge favor and don't waste precious time on drive-thru
