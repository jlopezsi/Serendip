i watched this despite the poor reviews but found to my disappointment that they really weren't lying the script acting pacing effects just about everything here is terrible the script is at least so inane in places as to be funny and the plot is sufficiently wacky that it raises a small level of gonzoid fun but it is a pretty small level there was potential here but only realised in a very light sprinkling of interesting touches that keep the film from the lowest rating the gore is tame and far too sparse but there are a couple of weirdly effective moments some ludicrous fx work too sometimes funny the setting is interesting and the inhabitants of hellgate put in some mildly effective if basically pointless appearances there's just about enough here that it might be mindlessly entertaining to someone in a very altered state of mind but it would take a lot to ameliorate the awfulness so in my opinion beware
