ginger snaps:unleashed is a pretty smart sequel to my beloved werewolf horror ginger snaps brigitte is an addict.after mixing blood with her sister ginger she has been infected with the virus.each day the curse grows stronger and she must increase her dosage of injections.when she is found lying face down in the snow after the near escape from another beast,she is thrown into drug rehabilitation-locked behind the doors without her life-saving antidote ginger snaps:unleashed is almost as good as the first one.the soundtrack is awesome and creates a creepy atmosphere of desperation and isolation.there is plenty of gore and violence and some really vicious werewolf attacks.the acting is excellent with outstanding performance by emily perkins.the film is really tense,so if you liked the original you won't be disappointed.highly recommended
