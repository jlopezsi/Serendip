i didn't even know laura dern existed until 6 month ago when i saw wild at heart maybe i did see her in jurrassic park but she didn't leave a mark on me this time she did wow what a great super actress i found that after seeing ld in several movies she is great in factual stories like october sky whatever she does she makes a believer out of me here she is a top grade doctor who blows the whistle on the hmo doctors well i always thought there was something wrong with this system anyway there is something wrong with the new american people that whenever they can steal a dollar they'd rather do that than earn it this is a story about such people not about poor people but about rich people who want to get richer and they use the poor peoples money to do it thanks laura i love you more today than i did yesterday by the way if you ever see this i only give 10 rarely but your best movie a brave movie was without question was citizen ruth i ought to know i've watched it 10 times or more please give my best to alexander payne greatest director of all time
