in my opinion this is an absolutely romantic masterpiece about breaking rules to be together if you ask me the law about children of fire and children of water was absolutely pointless you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why on the other hand malta voice of mami koyama was a very beautiful young woman i believe that she and sirius voice of t√¥ru furuya were truly meant for each other to me the setting was beautiful the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well now in conclusion i highly recommend this absolutely romantic masterpiece about breaking rules to be together to all of you who haven't seen it you're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
