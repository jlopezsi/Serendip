this movie has a storyline that is strangely perverse for a made for tv movie it is about a stranger in a black car who roams a small desert town kidnapping raping and finally killing a series of young schoolgirls br br joanna cassidy brings her young daughter to a small desert town to get away from the violence of the big city but shortly after she arrives to take a job as a bus driver for the local school a stranger in a black dodge charger begins to kidnap rape and eventually begins to kill a number of the young schoolgirls br br poorly directed poorly paced and with far too many slow motion shots for the kind of movie that it is this movie is a good example of the kind of movie that should not be done to tv because of the limitations of the medium an unrated film of this nature could have gone far enough with the type of storyline and that would make for a flat out nasty horror film
