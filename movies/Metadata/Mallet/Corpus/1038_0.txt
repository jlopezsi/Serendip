i don't know if it was intentional or not but i and most of the audience laughed at this one all the way through the suicidal kid reminded me of one of my exes i think people have judged this film a bit too harshly for what it is br br it plays out almost like a mockumentary i would say if you liked the school of rock this is its bastard cousin filled with profanity and a guy who starts screaming and then says he needs more coffee i have to praise the editor for linking those bits together br br i got into this movie for free so i would say if you have the means to get into the movie for free you should it is definitely an eye opener
