this movie is not for the masses in fact it's probably not even suitable for a major cult following but if you see it you'll either like it or hate it major plot developments happen off camera or while multiple people are talking very typical robert altman style but definitely more off-beat since it is based on two characters from national lampoon magazine if you're the kind of person that needs to identify with and/or like at least one character in the movie you may find yourself searching throughout the whole film don't expect a pause in the action to laugh which if this movie agrees with you you'll be doing often as these two teenagers deal with a bad situation through harassment and booze
