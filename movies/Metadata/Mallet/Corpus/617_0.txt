what should i say about days of our lives i started watching it when i was a teenager about 5 years ago i think i was 15 at that time at first i found it boring but as i persisted watching the show i realised it that it's not that boring after all that show is fun to watch and interesting as well as the days passed by i became addicted to it i really got into it i left watching it for a while cause i've been busy but then i got into it again i think the actors in dool are amazing they know how to act my fave couple used to be belle and phillip but i don't feel that way anymore as the years passed by i became a fan of the teenage friends will and mia they are fun so far i'm loving the storyline
