a movie that totally blew me away when i first saw it somehow i've missed out on anything like it if there is why br br it contains action drama and has somewhere i think a conscience but i'm not sure br br mr boorman is such a talented filmmaker who every time somethings bordering on getting personal might it be action or drama or feelings in general put a little distance between the audience and the camera again its not much hardly noticeable br br what is does however is that it render the movie tones of reality tiny pieces of documentary that somehow also makes it a powerful statement without indulging in pointers still its no lame movie it just has nuances<br br this might be seen as total contrast to many hollywood action movies who instead indulge themselves in personal feelings of the protagonists and even heighten them technically in order to manipulate the audience to co-feeling we as an audience are relieved of the responsibility of our feelings somewhat br br mr boorman leaves us with a choice br br something about the story then an american architect works in south america on the border of the amazon one day his young son is kidnapped by indians cant tell you more sorry this is the start off br br a must see
