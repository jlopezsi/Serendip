i just watched this episode today and it seems as though every time i watch it i get chills the ones that are saying this episode is too preachy you maybe right to a degree however this episode makes a powerful and chilling statement br br some who commented above said that he used to think that this episode was preachy but no more if you look around especially with the obama administration we are seeing more and more government control and the american people just seem to give in today all in the name of safety and also in the name of anit piracy obama wants to pass a law that would give law enforcement the power to come in to your home without a warrent and confiscate computers that are suspected to hold illegal copywritten material no search warrant only if they suspect that you have such material if this isn't a form of nearly total government control i don't know what is and no offense to the ones who say this episode is preachy but if i had any complaints whatsoever it would be that maybe this episode wasn't preachy enough given the fact that we are where we are today and someone in the above post also illuded that perhaps this was a slam against democrats i disagree i believe that rod was say that any for of government can be like this rebuplicans and democrats a like br br to those who haven't seen it strap in and be ready for an intellectual ride in my view this episode is by far my favorite
