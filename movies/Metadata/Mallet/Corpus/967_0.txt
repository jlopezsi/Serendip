shooting fish was something i got out on a risk you know no other film in video store take a chance br br it proved to be a wise decision as the film was very funny two great opposites for the main male characters and the stunning kate beckinsale acted the part wonderfully br br the film has no slow points but does not rush things the accompanying music is very good and acting first class br br i would recommend this film to anyone
