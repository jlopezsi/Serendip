i have always loved this movie i don't know how my dad bought it but it must have been popular in the states when i was young it is my favorite animated movie because of how beautiful it is i used to pretend i was princess malta every night before i went to bed please try to find and see it if you are a lover of pretty things my favorite thing about this movie is how sacrifice is romanticized the only downside is the overused romeo and juliet theme albeit the story deviates from the older story enough to fool younger viewers malta is drawn very beautifully and so is oceanus the sea god it is very dreamy and beautiful to journey into the world of the sea prince and the fire child
