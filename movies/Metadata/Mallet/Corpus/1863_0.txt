unfortunately as soon as i saw that this was a partly canadian production from the opening credits i very nearly turned it off as most things than come out of there are either boring or pale and poor imitations of the usa i should have switched off this movie rambles along in all sorts of directions with no apparent reference to anything is it a film about a broken marriage a love affair a faith healer a child terminally ill or what seems that even those making it ain't got a clue and it gives the distinct impression of being made-up as it goes along no one wants to be a critic there are a few good scenes and good acting but i found the whole picture disorganized and dis-orientated with neither meaning or message.even the title is daft a generous 3 out of 10
