it's hard to imagine saying this about an outrageous comedy but robin williams who made his career at least the early part of it by doing outrageous comedy and the more outrageous the better is completely totally and absolutely outshone in the bird cage by nathan lane that's not a criticism of williams he was fine but lane was simply over the top funny as the very feminine drag queen albert the gay lover/spouse of armand williams armand and albert have a son they've raised val played by dan futterman and he's about to get married to barbara calista flockhart the catch barbara's father is the extremely conservative senator kevin keeler gene hackman and he'll be none too pleased by the family his daughter is marrying in to br br you'll laugh pretty much the whole way through at lane and it isn't just lane at times williams is playing the second or even third banana by the end of the movie there's albert and armand's maid agador spartacus hank azaria who's almost as funny as lane and while i don't want to give too much away when you catch a glimpse of hackman in drag near the end of the movie you'll be in stitches br br it's great fun burdened a little bit by an unnecessary decision to have keeler involved in a political scandal the whole movie would have worked quite well without that particular subplot still this is a very funny movie turn to it whenever you need a laugh 8/10
