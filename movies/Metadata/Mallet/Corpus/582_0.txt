the milieu here is the family and friends of the commodore john dehner very rich folks the commodore is murdered and just as we think columbo has the killer robert vaughan cornered he's murdered too columbo assembles all the possible suspects in a room at the end and goes through a charlie chan or hercule poirot routine to expose the real killer whose motive turns out to be greed br br this is thin stuff although the director patrick mcgoohan a talented actor tries to lay it on with a trowel i would guess the script started off as an hour-long show for mannix or dan august or something there are many attempts to pad it out with humor and none of them are funny see lieutenant columbo try to wrestle himself into a full lotus position that'll be ten cents characters get rather elaborate introductions and then play no more than the usual minor roles worse this is a somewhat different columbo than the character his fans have come to know he's bumbling of course and has to cope with the difference between a mainmast and a mizzenmast but on top of that he's cute he winks he smiles his comments are coy and what does it all boil down to a two-minute experiment at the end in which the killer reveals his guilt the rest were all red herrings br br there would be worse episodes after the series was revived and wrung out but this is certainly one of the weakest of the original series despite the talent in front of and behind the camera
