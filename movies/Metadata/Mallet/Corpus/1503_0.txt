you might initially be reluctant to give the glass house a try if you've been turned off by many recent thrillers as they often have been disappointingly by the book this is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like pacific heights and unlawful entry and though it does play by the rules unforutnately there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare not that pacific heights wasn't highly entertaining br br leelee sobieski plays ruby baker a kid going through the terrible teens when she and her brother's parents die in a car accident they move in with ultra-modern family friends terry and erin glass you know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the glass couple but you can never be too sure exactly what at first that's the purpose of a thriller to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're hopefully pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed but ruby baker is a smart kid who's ever-present skepticism about the intentions of her new surrogate parents and starts trying to figure out what's wrong unfortunately this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters social workers lawyers teachers etc who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate and in turn making things worse for poor ruby it also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he's-not-really dead ending br br but there is something that makes this better than most of its kind on the one hand you're never sure whether you can always trust ruby because even she too arrogant most of the time seems like trouble it's hard to sympathize for a character like that at first and not only does stellan skarsg√•rd make an appropriate villain as terry glass his wife played by diane lane is not entirely an innocent creature herself as most women are often written to be in the role of the creep's wife/girlfriend/mother etc a good mix of characters and a creepy setting combined with a decent finale make it just the perfect mix of suspenseful elements and one that i would recommend seeing
