this supposed action pic should be marketed as a comedy of errors that is wooden acting a ridiculous plot and numerous continuity errors could be over looked if you watch this as a laff packed action fest right from the get go you know your in la la land when the rangers jump out of a hercules transport at dawn somewhere over the mideast but then after a water landing they surface in the dark the continuity errors continue throuout the pic costumes and make up change multiple times within scenes but ya know what it does'nt matter the script is even more ludicrous after the rangers capture a terrorist and bring him to the usa the bad guys do a night landing of several hundred baddies on a fl beach using ww2 landing craft yuh right br br all this does'nt matter if you view this as a 6 pack comedy you get paratrooper fu our favorite 90's and new millennium bad guys the typical hollywood arab idiots and best of all a duelling bus-fu chase to top it all off i love bus chases esp when trains are involved
