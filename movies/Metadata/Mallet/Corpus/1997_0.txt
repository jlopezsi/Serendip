an excellent movie where everything is beautiful from the crumbling claustrophobic backdrops of the antagonists hiding places the actors and the background music br br besides showing an unusual homosexual relationship the film also questions the relationship between sex love and violence even when the main characters turn straight violence and death hang in the air with scenes sex often interspliced with those of death and agony br br more importantly you can't help but feel sorry and yet almost envious for the doomed and did i mention beautiful lovers as they slide towards their inevitable end just for the incredible passion they have for each other
