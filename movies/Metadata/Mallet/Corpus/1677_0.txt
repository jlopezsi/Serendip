for several reasons this is the comparatively hidden entry in the classic fred astaire-ginger rogers filmography but this 1935 film has been blissfully released in a fairly clean print transfer on dvd both as an individual purchase and as part of a complete astaire-rogers dvd set with great songs from the jerome kern songbook the movie certainly contains the high-caliber musical quality of the other films starring the dancing pair the challenge is really in the cumbersome story set-up and in the simple fact that astaire and rogers play decidedly secondary characters in the story br br the film's primary focus is on stephanie an exiled russian princess working as a sales assistant in the house of roberta the most fashionable couturière in all of paris it is run by a lovable dowager referred to as aunt minnie whose nephew jack kent ends up in paris after his band gets fired right after they disembark from their transatlantic voyage astaire plays jack's best friend bandleader huck haines and rogers is a faux-polish countess named sharvenka a.k.a lizzie gatz huck's ex-dancing partner who has become a paris nightclub headliner the various romantic pairings occur but an unexpected tragedy strikes with minnie's death and her wish to leave the shop to the woefully unqualified jack who of course needs stephanie's fashion sense to make the company continue to thrive br br the plot threads start to feel unwieldy after a while but journeyman director william a seiter is smart enough to know when to include the musical interludes astaire-rogers fans may be disappointed to find them dance only twice in the film together the first well after the half-hour mark in an informal but energetic tap routine and the second near the end in their standard formal wear astaire has only one solo to i won't dance and perhaps to pacify fans there is a brief reprisal dance inserted after the story's actual ending though dramatically it makes little sense irene dunne gets to sing three songs a russian lullaby and three kern gems yesterdays smoke gets in your eyes and lovely to look at in her bell-like operatic soprano pretty in itself but seemingly at odds with the jazzy sound of the rest of the score br br a year before she let her inner screwball comedienne emerge in theodora goes wild a severe-looking dunne is saddled with a stiff uninteresting part as stephanie and she is not aided much by a bumptious randolph scott who has to play the somewhat ignorant and judgmental jack on a relative one note astaire and a particularly funny rogers on the other hand are breezy and sharp with the little screen time they do get little-remembered claire dodd predictably plays jack's slithery fiancée sophie while character actress helen westley plays minnie with her amusing gruffness intact she was to reunite with dunne the next year in james whale's classic version of showboat br br there's an extended fashion show at the end and you can easily spot a bleached blonde baby-faced lucille ball in ostrich feathers among the models the resulting movie shows the whole to be somewhat less than the sum of its parts but it's still worthwhile for the talent involved in the production the 2006 dvd contains some interesting curios as extras the original trailer in relatively poor condition a full-color twenty-minute 1935 musical short starlit days the lido with oddly attired variety acts entertaining bemused hollywood stars like clark gable and robert montgomery a vintage cartoon the calico dragon about a little girl's dream of her stuffed animals coming to life to protect her from the dragon and an eleven-minute audio-only radio promo for the movie
